{"identifier":66905,"ep:Repository":51,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Improving the collection and use of human egress data","bibo:abstract":"The analysis of human behavior in fire is a relatively young field, only existing for a matter of decades. For much of this time it was used to support the related engineering process, rather than as a significant pursuit in its own right—to provide support for the assumptions used by engineers, designers and by regulators. Prior to this point, the engineering process excluded the human response from the assessment process altogether. The field originally developed according to two principle\r\nobjectives, both of which were tied to the practice of fire safety engineering: the ability to establish the importance of human performance and then the provision of key supporting evidence for engineering practice. In both instances, the development of the field was determined by engineering practice, rather than the generation of a\r\ncomprehensive theory that helped to explain and predict phenomena. This evolution of the field has led to an incomplete, disorganized and disparate understanding of the\r\nsubject matter: human performance in fire. The lifeblood of any field of study is data—data that bridges the gap between observation, understanding and application.\r\nThis article, and the project on which it is based, represents an attempt to strengthen the data collection process, the representation of this data, and the dissemination of this data to interested parties; i.e., to strengthen the study of human performance in fire. This will be achieved through the provision of several tools (to aid the collection and presentation of data), that will be combined together in the form of an online data portal. This will benefit the field, allow the development of more refined and more comprehensive theories, and allow for better informed engineering activities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gwynne, Steve"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.3149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.313264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.312218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931672,"sim:weight":0.308525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.30439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.302396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.296589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.296589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.296589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.296589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.296589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.296589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.296589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.296589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.296589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.296589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.296589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.296589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.296589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.296589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This has potentially\r\nserious consequences during an evacuation, especially where structures have been designed on the basis of the successful application of emergency procedures. The\r\nreaction of the resident population to these procedures is sensitive to their normal use of the structure and the level to which the population is engaged and familiar with\r\nthe procedure. A method is presented to develop procedures for non-emergency and emergency situations in partnership with the resident population, to take advantage of their indigenous knowledge, to improve their familiarity and to engage them in the safety process. This method is appropriate for situations where emergency procedures\r\nare normally applied and where the population is not transient; e.g., an office environment, where emergency procedures had been developed. It is felt that by adopting\r\nthis approach, the population will be more receptive to the application of these procedures and that their response may then be more predictable. As an example of this method, a project framework is outlined in order to describe the approach in sufficient detail and to encourage future application and testing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gwynne, Steve"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60716,"sim:weight":0.557383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387072,"sim:weight":0.257076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710037,"sim:weight":0.233161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.225906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.225906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.225906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.225906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.225906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.225906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.225906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.225906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.225906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.225906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.225906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.225906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.225906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.225906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.214724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103105,"sim:weight":0.211521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664656,"sim:weight":0.211093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Due to the increase in complexity of sensor network applications, self-configuration abilities, in terms of service discovery and automatic negotiation, have become core requirements. Further, as such systems are highly dynamic due to mobility and/or unreliability; runtime self-optimisation and self-healing is required. However the mechanism to implement this must be lightweight due to the sensor nodes being low in resources, and scalable as some applications can require thousands of nodes. BioANS incorporates some characteristics of natural emergent systems and these contribute to its overall stability whilst it remains simple and efficient. We show that not only does the BioANS protocol implement autonomicity in allowing a dynamic network of sensors to continue to function under demanding circumstances, but that the overheads incurred are reasonable. Moreover, state-flapping between requester and provider, message loss and randomness are not only tolerated but utilised to advantage in the new protocol.","bibo:AuthorList":["Breza, Michael","Anthony, Richard","McCann, Julie A."],"dc:date":"2007-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26670,"sim:weight":0.451776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43308,"sim:weight":0.413922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102618,"sim:weight":0.328571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931241,"sim:weight":0.32633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.326328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931258,"sim:weight":0.324689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.310564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.310047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.307175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.300281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.298356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146107,"sim:weight":0.296888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101562,"sim:weight":0.292448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.281398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.281398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.281398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.281398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.281398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.281398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.281398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Autonomic systems can have many self-management characteristics in order to solve issues which would normally require a human to manage, maintain or correct. These characteristics include the ability to heal, configure, optimize and protect themselves. We have taken the Teleo-Reactive (T-R) technique, developed for control of autonomous agents, and designed a framework around T-R to support development of much higher level software. We argue that a T-R approach is a simpler method of developing autonomic systems than many other techniques. Although T-R systems are relatively easy to understand and can produce small and compact code structures, the design process can be difficult. In this paper we highlight the problems and develop some strategies for designing T-R programs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hawthorne, James","Anthony, Richard"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":12961,"sim:weight":0.281713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1141332,"sim:weight":0.271529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105051,"sim:weight":0.224843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61040,"sim:weight":0.218881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998261,"sim:weight":0.20617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998308,"sim:weight":0.203877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827052,"sim:weight":0.198097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664520,"sim:weight":0.194562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.19339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.19339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.19339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.19339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.19339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.19339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.19339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.19339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.19339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.19339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.19339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.19339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

And this is perfectly understandable as these features effectively increase the systems autonomicity. However, in the case of safety-critical realtime systems it becomes crucial to determine how the entire system performance is affected by the growth in complexity of its autonomic / dynamic decision making engine which is processing the context information for control purposes. In this paper we consider policy-based computing as a candidate technology to support selected autonomic features and context-awareness in safety-critical systems. We conduct performance analysis in a generic policy-supervised system in order to determine the relation between policy complexity (reflecting decision making system complexity) and the decision evaluation time (affecting the entire system performance). We present a coherent characteristic polynomial method as a means of pre-estimation of policy evaluation time depending on its complexity. The results we present can be potentially used for pre-evaluation of whether a policy of a certain complexity level is of any applicability in a safety critical system that has to meet fixed real-time deadlines.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pelc, Mariusz","Anthony, Richard","Kawala-Janik, Aleksandra"],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67527,"sim:weight":0.414911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826955,"sim:weight":0.285459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146064,"sim:weight":0.270733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2707667,"sim:weight":0.243371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2707666,"sim:weight":0.242167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48414,"sim:weight":0.23952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932184,"sim:weight":0.221982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.218685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931886,"sim:weight":0.216631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.211257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.198606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61040,"sim:weight":0.195402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.195178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.195178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.195178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.195178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.195178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.195178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.195178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.195178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, these platforms represent highly dynamic environments in which performance and efficiency can be seriously impacted by changes in environmental conditions. This is especially significant where the runtime configuration has been determined statically, either at compilation time or at the start of execution. This paper introduces the concept of agile parallel processing in which the application manages several\r\naspects of its own run-time behaviour, including deployment granularity. This approach reduces the emphasis on the preconfiguration of components, and relies instead on inbuilt learning and discovery capabilities. To facilitate investigation into the extent to which a self-managing approach can be beneficial to parallel processing, an experimental framework has been developed. The framework\r\nprovides a range of services such as dynamicworker discovery and performance calibration, and policycontrolled\r\nfacilities such as resource management and adaptation to suit environmental conditions. The framework integrates these services with the parallel application code. The operation and performance of policy-based dynamic deployment scheduling in dynamic environments is analysed in detail.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anthony, Richard"],"dc:date":"2007-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67525,"sim:weight":0.413868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44610,"sim:weight":0.263652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386709,"sim:weight":0.259201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45662,"sim:weight":0.256397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1927108,"sim:weight":0.243645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.239782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43088,"sim:weight":0.238117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145901,"sim:weight":0.216798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709901,"sim:weight":0.21645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.214505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.214505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.214505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.214505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.214505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795322,"sim:weight":0.213687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43082,"sim:weight":0.210502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929818,"sim:weight":0.205281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930696,"sim:weight":0.200685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710181,"sim:weight":0.195538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48355,"sim:weight":0.193003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Tozer\u0027s mathematical model (1838)","bibo:abstract":"The paper presents Tozer\u0027s study of the effects of the mechanization of productive activities on employment as an effort to devise a mathematical model, as an analytical method that would be more general and robust than Ricardo\u0027s numerical examples. The contradictory nature of this achievement is emphasized: while with the help of algebra Tozer made significant progress in model building in economics, it is argued that his contribution to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon under study is much less satisfactory, due to the difficulties he faced in his effort to incorporate consumption and demand into a classical analytical framework.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tubaro, Paola"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.2491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998220,"sim:weight":0.237794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.214896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9840,"sim:weight":0.210661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The contribution of zero-intelligence agent trading models","bibo:abstract":"The paper investigates the minimum level of individual rationality that is needed for market prices to converge toward their equilibrium level. It does so by examining the theoretical and methodological foundations of the ‘zerointelligence’ (ZI) agent trading approach, with which Gode and Sunder (1993a) claimed that weak individual rationality requirements suffice to obtain equilibrium prices. The paper shows that ZI agents are endowed with a higher degree of rationality than previously believed. Though not maximizing utility, they exhibit utility-improving behavior, and their decision-making rules fulfill\r\nimportant predictions of the theory of choice based on maximization, namely downward-sloping individual demand and upward-sloping individual supply.\r\nAdditional cognitive skills would be required, were some simplifying assumptions of the basic model removed. Gode and Sunder’s analysis supports a nonneoclassical rational choice theory, in which optimization can be replaced by a\r\nvariety of behavioral rules, while still preserving mportant results on the functioning of markets.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tubaro, Paola"],"dc:date":"2009-03","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K J Arrow and F Hahn.

One of the technologies that has become a buzz word for many businesses is business process management or BPM. A business process comprises activities\r\nand tasks, the resources required to perform each task, and the business rules linking these activities and tasks. The tasks may be performed by human and/or machine actors.\r\nWorkflow provides a way of describing the order of execution and the dependent relationships between the constituting activities of short or long running processes.\r\nWorkflow allows businesses to capture not only the information but also the processes that transform the information - the process asset (Koulopoulos, T. M., 1995). Applications which involve automated, human-centric and collaborative processes across organisations are\r\ninherently different from one organisation to another. Even within the same organisation but over time, applications are adapted as ongoing change to the business processes is seen as the norm in today’s dynamic business environment. The major difference lies in the specifics of business processes which are changing rapidly in order to match the way in which businesses operate. In this chapter we introduce and discuss Business Process Management (BPM) with a focus on the integration of heterogeneous BPM systems across multiple organisations. We identify the problems and the main challenges not only with regards to technologies but also in the social and cultural context. We also discuss the issues that have arisen in our bid to find the solutions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ma, Chaoying","Caldera, Andrea","Petridis, Miltos","Bacon, Liz","Windall, Gill","Pomffyová, Mária"],"dc:date":"2010-04","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Keith Bennett.

This methodology provides present-day agent-based models with a sound and proper insight as to the behavior of social agents — an insight that statistical data often fall short of providing at least at a micro level and for hidden and sensitive populations. In the other direction, simulations can provide qualitative researchers in sociology, anthropology and other fields with valuable tools for: (a) testing the consistency and pushing the boundaries, of specific theoretical frameworks; (b) replicating and generalizing results; (c) providing a platform for cross-disciplinary validation of results.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tubaro, Paola","Casilli, Antonio A."],"dc:date":"2010-04","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P D\u0027Aquino, C Le Page, F Bousquet and A Bah.

Furthermore, the evolutionary growth and mutations spawned by Web 2.0 draw non-brand users, social networks and anti-branding movements towards engagement and the possession of greater social capital. When gifting stakeholders with a larger share of voice, consumption definitions become judged less by tangible transactions; and more by figurative, intangible and co-dependent communication drivers. In addition, with the increase in interactivity afforded by media channels, two-way communication, and the inclusion of more parties; a normalisation and levelling of information also occurs. Therefore, this chapter presents stakeholders as occupying grouped, interconnected and dynamic states - which are subject to time-specific communication, influence and self defined legitimacy. Following this, the creation of brands becomes a collaborative process - with brands seeking to engage consumers in new and innovative ways; in order to gain authenticity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilson, Jonathan A.J.","Kapoor, Avinash","Kulshrestha, Chinmaya"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":3205,"sim:weight":0.397468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47469,"sim:weight":0.390221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102668,"sim:weight":0.368548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":313483,"sim:weight":0.327324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23709,"sim:weight":0.318475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1023071,"sim:weight":0.297239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.233217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.186783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60447,"sim:weight":0.175821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1350122,"sim:weight":0.174966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664681,"sim:weight":0.16981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.169148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.169148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.169148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.169148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.169148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.169148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.169148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.169148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.169148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the first part of the coupling procedure, the fully\r\nunsteady incompressible or compressible flow equations for the nearfield\r\nof the unsteady flow are solved by using a Computational Fluid\r\nDynamics (CFD) technique, such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS),\r\nLarge Eddy Simulation (LES) or unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-\r\nStokes equations (RANS) the CFD predictions are then used to\r\ncalculate sound sources using the acoustic analogy or solving a set of\r\nacoustic perturbation equations (APE) leading to the solution of the\r\nacoustic field. It is possible to use a 2-D reduced problem to provide a\r\npreliminary understanding of many acoustic problems. Unfortunately\r\n2-D CFD simulations using a fine-mesh-small-time-step-LES-alike\r\nnumerical method cannot be considered as LES, which applies to 3-D\r\nsimulations only. Therefore it is necessary to understand the similarities\r\nand the effect between filters applied to unsteady compressible\r\nNavier-Stokes equations and the combined effect of high-order\r\nschemes and mesh size. The aim of this study is to provide suitable\r\nLES-alike methods for 2-D simulations. An efficient software\r\nimplementation of high-order schemes is also proposed.

Myths and dogma about rodents and their population outbreaks abound. They are imbedded in the culture and language of many societies. In many instances, it is the acceptance of these outbreaks by society that is our greatest challenge. The reason these episodic outbreaks become etched in the socio-cultural psyche from the sparsely populated uplands of Laos to the considerably more affluent agricultural lands of Europe is that the impacts are often staggering - economically, socially, and even politically. The book is a collation of contributions from Asia, Africa, Oceania (Australia and New Zealand), Europe, and North America. The advent of ecologically based rodent management has stimulated the progress summarized in this book. The contributions provide a modern appraisal to an age-old problem through a better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to rodent outbreaks, why rodent population numbers increase under different circumstances, and the impact of outbreaks in a range of different agroecosystems and native forests in different parts of the world. This is an encouraging progress report driven by scientists passionate about rodents, about people, about conservation, and about improving our knowledge of these species and the ecosystems they inhabit. And, in a novel twist, there is an appendix of recipes for preparing rat meat. You will be more than tempted to try one of these dishes the next time you travel in Asia or Africa.","bibo:AuthorList":["Singleton, Grant R.","Belmain, Steve R.","Brown, Peter R.","Hardy, Bill","Singleton, Grant R.","Belmain, Steve R.","Brown, Peter R.","Hardy, Bill"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":315779,"sim:weight":0.633009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81978,"sim:weight":0.413932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.411362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.411362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316337,"sim:weight":0.404461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":567998,"sim:weight":0.403342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.393684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108770,"sim:weight":0.392495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1130185,"sim:weight":0.37556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":567997,"sim:weight":0.371629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":359523,"sim:weight":0.354397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108390,"sim:weight":0.351305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":537672,"sim:weight":0.341899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":600875,"sim:weight":0.341773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":599999,"sim:weight":0.338934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62357,"sim:weight":0.334537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1079895,"sim:weight":0.331638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710013,"sim:weight":0.32688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384482,"sim:weight":0.326332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":651185,"sim:weight":0.325541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Among the three geometric characteristics, i.e. bifurcation, constriction and bending channel, which have been widely used in promoting biofluid separation, the original separator (Figure 1) has put the focus on the bifurcation effect and also adopts a constriction at the inlet end to implement some constriction effect. This modification is targeted to a strong integrative application of these three channel geometries characteristics. For this purpose, curve/arc constrictions are implemented inside the bifurcation region between bifurcations, so that both constriction and bending channel effects can be effectively fulfilled at each bifurcation to increase the effectiveness. Both 2D and 3D designs for fulfilling this modification are offered. The flow field and separation process in the modified 2D biochip are analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique and compared with the original separator. Comparably the modified design leads to more volumetric separation of plasma rich fluid from the side channels and results in low flow rate ratio due to the increased channel resistance in the main channel. Improvements in using constriction and bending channel effects have been numerically evidenced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Xue, Xiangdong","Bailey, Chris","Patel, Mayur K."],"dc:date":"2010-09-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67425,"sim:weight":0.449878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67426,"sim:weight":0.384824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268052,"sim:weight":0.232397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934577,"sim:weight":0.201132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99072,"sim:weight":0.193855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930602,"sim:weight":0.188897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997643,"sim:weight":0.174945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931964,"sim:weight":0.148081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24953,"sim:weight":0.147458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98504,"sim:weight":0.14373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":918856,"sim:weight":0.142098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48331,"sim:weight":0.141021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.138886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26959,"sim:weight":0.134173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77180,"sim:weight":0.133904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99442,"sim:weight":0.131283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98555,"sim:weight":0.130849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387380,"sim:weight":0.129946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934808,"sim:weight":0.126691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99013,"sim:weight":0.124875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Though a number of creep constitutive laws of lead-free solder have been reported due to the importance of creep in solder joint failure in the electronic packaging, these constitutive laws often show great variations across the applicable stress range. In-situ measurement of strain fields in micro regions can help make the creep model more realistic. In this study, shear tests have been carried out on small solder joints in order to gain insight into the factors affecting solder properties. In order to measure the strain in solder joints, the Digital Image Correlation Method (DICM) has been used. The experimental results proved that there are two mechanisms that disturb the uniform deformation in solder joint. One is the interfacial strain concentration which has a dimension of less than 30μm and the other is spreading across interfaces from the locally deformed area, which has a size from about 50μm to 100μm. The existence of these local concentrations of creep strain is thought to be at least one of the causes of the variations in the published creep parameters. The deformation of solder joint on the shear test has also been modeled using Finite Element Method (FEM), and a three-layered model has been proposed to simulate the experimental results.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shishido, Nobuyuki","Kanno, Toshifumi","Kawahara, Shinya","Ikeda, Toru","Miyazaki, Noriyuki","Lu, Hua","Bailey, Chris","Thomas, Owen","Di Maio, Davide","Hunt, Chris"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":767758,"sim:weight":0.7064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":967772,"sim:weight":0.373287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18170,"sim:weight":0.285659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795333,"sim:weight":0.25542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101255,"sim:weight":0.252362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44033,"sim:weight":0.237142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145833,"sim:weight":0.237109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933621,"sim:weight":0.236676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99317,"sim:weight":0.215666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.202712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.189214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98825,"sim:weight":0.182091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109166,"sim:weight":0.173014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98934,"sim:weight":0.169607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25794,"sim:weight":0.164391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101383,"sim:weight":0.16215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101443,"sim:weight":0.160878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43797,"sim:weight":0.151073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43995,"sim:weight":0.150942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98745,"sim:weight":0.148476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this study we demonstrate that the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan hydrochloride can be successfully loaded into the DC Bead sulfonate-modified polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel matrix, resulting in a sustained-release drug eluting bead (DEBTOP) useful for therapeutic purposes. The in vitro drug loading capacity, elution characteristics and the effects on mechanical properties of the beads are described with reference to our previous work with irinotecan hydrochloride (DEBIRI). Results showed that drug loading was faster when the solution was agitated compared to static loading and a maximum loading of ca. 40–45 mg topotecan in 1 ml hydrated beads was achievable. Loading the drug into the beads altered the size, compressibility moduli and colour of the bead. Elution was shown to be reliant on the presence of ions to perform the necessary exchange with the electrostatically bound topotecan molecules. Topotecan was shown by MTS assay to have an IC50 for human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (PSN-1) of 0.22 and 0.27 lM compared to 28.1 and 19.2 lM for irinotecan at 48 and 72 h, respectively. The cytotoxic efficacy of DEBTOP on PSN-1 was compared to DEBIRI. DEPTOP loaded at 6 \u0026 30 mg ml-1, like its free drug form, was shown to be more potent than DEBIRI of comparable doses at 24, 48 \u0026 72 h using a slightly modified MTS assay. Using a PSN-1 mouse xenograft model,\r\nDEBIRI doses of 3.3–6.6 mg were shown to be welltolerated\r\n(even with repeat administration) and effective in reducing the tumour size. DEBTOP however, was lethal after 6 days at doses of 0.83–1.2 mg but demonstrated reasonable efficacy and tolerability (again with repeat injection possible) at 0.2–0.4 mg doses. Care must therefore be taken when selecting the dose of topotecan to be loaded into DC Bead given its greater potency and potential toxicity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Forster, Richard E.J.","Small, Sharon A.","Tang, Yiqing","Heaysman, Clare L.","Lloyd, Andrew W.","Macfarlane, Wendy","Phillips, Gary J.","Antonijevic, Milan D.","Lewis, Andrew L."],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1117182,"sim:weight":0.227659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98645,"sim:weight":0.1997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15225,"sim:weight":0.199511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85635,"sim:weight":0.180187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":749534,"sim:weight":0.174267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":834143,"sim:weight":0.167593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930758,"sim:weight":0.144227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101436,"sim:weight":0.138396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98860,"sim:weight":0.13513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43211,"sim:weight":0.133693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387350,"sim:weight":0.133561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101526,"sim:weight":0.127498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99002,"sim:weight":0.124238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.123657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340647,"sim:weight":0.120964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780372,"sim:weight":0.116232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101347,"sim:weight":0.113509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.113453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.108767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98988,"sim:weight":0.108142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Historically, transport programmes were substantially about developing basic infrastructure networks. Now the emphasis is on the active management of systems and operating them to maximum advantage in the face of growing travel demand and capacity limitations. Combined developments in technology and the world economy have accelerated change to almost unpredictable levels. The change affects many areas and transport is not an exception. With new vehicle technologies, radical policies and the persistent growth in private and commercial vehicles, a new changing transport landscape is emerging.\r\nOne of these changes comes in the form of sustainable transport management - managing the demand of existing infrastructure networks. The role of demand management has been illustrated in many reports and papers and it seems that governments are becoming more aware of it. This paper focuses on one particular demand management policy that is often regarded as radical and generally unacceptable. Road pricing often gets delayed or abandoned due to controversy, disagreements, unanticipated problems and a whole host of other delaying factors. There are complex interactions in transport management - there is a need for cooperation between networks, stakeholders and different authorities.\r\nSingle measures that focus on \u0027sustainable transport\u0027 usually address a limited set of objectives and are not usually combined with other policy measures. When combined, it is sometimes unclear whether the multiple interactions between policy tools and implementation networks have been considered. An emerging case of implementation of a policy package in the UK is the support of road pricing initiatives combined with public transport improvements by the Transport Innovation Fund.\r\nThe paper will present a review of the UK road pricing situation along with key implementation factors that show firstly the importance of combining policy tools and secondly the necessity in creating and maintaining strong implementation networks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ieromonachou, Petros","Warren, James P.","Potter, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1421,"sim:weight":0.562522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81928,"sim:weight":0.555255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":888,"sim:weight":0.473021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352138,"sim:weight":0.442243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43462,"sim:weight":0.381499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709929,"sim:weight":0.296133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.28753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632272,"sim:weight":0.277868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.273426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.273426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.273426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.273426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.273426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.273426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.273426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.273426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.273426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.273426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.273426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.273426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Any investment in transport infrastructure must be justified by future use. Legacy use of post-Olympic sports and transport facilities is but one example of a potential solution to the urban planning dilemma, and possibly an easier one to consider. It would be grossly inefficient to build roads and networks that are under-utilised post-Olympics or that need large further investment in order to make them useful after the Games. However, there is little evidence that past Games have delivered benefits to those people and places most in need. Indication of a sustainable and positive legacy from previous Olympic Games is mixed and uneven – for example in terms of improvements to housing and transport, as well as in terms of community and cultural facilities.\r\nThis paper attempts to pre-empt answers for questions such as: How can well-specified short-term design requirements be combined with the flexibility to address long-term transport needs? How do we know that what we perceive as legacy now will be considered as such in 10 or 30 or 50 years? The paper examines the proposed sustainable transport provision for the London 2012 Olympics and its intended legacy role in economic and social regeneration across East London. A framework is presented, based on a scorecard system, to evaluate the London Olympics transport infrastructure design conundrum. The scorecard factors concerning past host cities include: Aspiration, Urban renewal, Environment, City economy, Tourism, Sports and Community Participation, Disability awareness, Employment, Skills. Part of the dilemma in these types of measurements is the act of hindsight; the impact of the Games is not clearly known until long after the Games are complete.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ieromonachou, Petros","Warren, James P.","Potter, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930486,"sim:weight":0.759972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67025,"sim:weight":0.58477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45239,"sim:weight":0.503206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89639,"sim:weight":0.454841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85536,"sim:weight":0.275671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9624008,"sim:weight":0.265942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665966,"sim:weight":0.259957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44343,"sim:weight":0.256617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67390,"sim:weight":0.253263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930419,"sim:weight":0.25125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70539,"sim:weight":0.241419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.239845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.239845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.239845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.239845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.239845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.239845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.239845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.239845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.239845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

With the worldwide climate of economic recession, many industries including tourism face a less certain future. The possible fluctuations in dynamics and the direct effects on society and economy challenge the idea that the tourism industry is a financially sustainable path to follow. At the same time, the current and predicted trends in tourist activities show that this is also not an environmentally sustainable path.\r\nUsing published data from the Statistical Service of the Republic of Cyprus (RoC), a set of trends is presented. Since the majority of high energy consumption activities take place during transit and at the destination place, the set includes trends for international travel, as well as local and contextual figures such as the use of rental cars, accommodation, other items of consumption, and overall contribution to GDP from tourism earnings. The paper examines tourism and aviation and calculates CO2 emissions and energy over an annual period for a selected year. The resulting estimates are discussed with respect to tourists’ energy consumption and the effect they have on the national energy use. These are issues pertinent for more sustainable and long-term strategic objectives that Cyprus and other comparable tourism destinations may find useful.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ieromonachou, Petros","Warren, James P."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4754,"sim:weight":0.824406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101516,"sim:weight":0.576034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101270,"sim:weight":0.571148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101263,"sim:weight":0.568813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101686,"sim:weight":0.554317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664716,"sim:weight":0.529632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.527399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632101,"sim:weight":0.527233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61142,"sim:weight":0.504359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101658,"sim:weight":0.493392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652783,"sim:weight":0.492664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":715080,"sim:weight":0.460345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":715033,"sim:weight":0.450127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386779,"sim:weight":0.443953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631621,"sim:weight":0.43375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58899,"sim:weight":0.426915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98803,"sim:weight":0.424557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102671,"sim:weight":0.424467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101372,"sim:weight":0.416093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101376,"sim:weight":0.395536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Liberalised industries are still characterised by high levels of market concentration and low levels of transparency and market integration.

In section I, we discuss the theoretical issues and demonstrate that ‘marketable’ yet simplistic arguments in favour of liberalization tend to ignore a complex set of issues such as imperfect competition, imperfect information, and second-best consequences that are highly likely to limit or prevent the achievement of efficiency and welfare gains. In section II, we review the empirical findings. We find that the partial evidence in support of the liberalization agenda in the telecommunications and energy sectors is overshadowed by the evidence suggesting that liberalization and regulation have usually failed to deliver the expected efficiency gains. In Section III, we narrow our focus to investment and innovation in the telecommunications and electricity sectors. The evidence here suggests that liberalization may be conducive to incremental innovation/investment in sectors where maintaining market shares and/or mark-ups is a significant concern. However, liberalization has either negative or ambiguous effects on investment in radical breakthroughs, and it does not necessarily lead to optimal investment when compared with public monopolies. Finally, in the conclusion, we summarise the main findings and highlight the implications for the European integration process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flacher, David","Jennequin, Hugues","Ugur, Mehmet","Frangakis, Marica","Hermann, Christoph","Huffschmid, Jörg","Lóránt, Károly"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":617659,"sim:weight":0.354468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":560839,"sim:weight":0.351638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101473,"sim:weight":0.252884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103104,"sim:weight":0.232216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146160,"sim:weight":0.225165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710579,"sim:weight":0.221124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47206,"sim:weight":0.216737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77832,"sim:weight":0.215441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":315040,"sim:weight":0.213745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95478,"sim:weight":0.201791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67211,"sim:weight":0.196143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.195097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.194842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2775044,"sim:weight":0.194645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67082,"sim:weight":0.193537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96138,"sim:weight":0.193384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67206,"sim:weight":0.186224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76011,"sim:weight":0.177585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108846,"sim:weight":0.177024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67102,"sim:weight":0.176752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Nevertheless, this literature tends to view the anchoring of policy reform as an exogenously given option for a reforming country. We demonstrate that anchoring is an endogenously determined choice, which may guarantee neither optimal levels of policy reform nor effective anchoring unless the relevant contracts are both complete and incentive compatible. We examine the economic pillar of the Euro-Med Partnership (EMP) to ascertain the extent to which its contractual provisions satisfy these conditions. Our findings suggest that the EMP leaves too much room for discretion and does not internalize the positive externalities associated with policy reform. These findings enable us to elaborate on why the EU cannot be expected to function as an effective anchor for policy reform for its trading partners.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tovias, Alfred","Ugur, Mehmet"],"dc:date":"2004-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(1994).

In his view, this depends more on the executive’s credibility deficit than on the new measures introduced. Analysis of institutional and governance indicators reflecting the quality of policies implemented and their effect on economic performance suggest that, rather than claim credit for results achieved in the past, the AKP government should be more committed to the pursuit of institutional and political reforms.

The levitation confinement mechanism for large volumes of fluid is considerably different from the case of a small droplet where surface tension plays a key role in constraining the liquid outflow at the critical bottom point. The dynamic interaction between the oscillatory motion of the free surface and the effects of turbulent flow is analysed using a unified numerical model which describes the time dependent behaviour of the liquid metal and the magnetic field. The MHD modified k-omega turbulence model is used to describe the mixing and damping properties at smaller scales not resolved by the macro model. The numerical multiphysics simulations suggest that it is possible to levitate a few kilograms of liquid metal in a cold crucible without requiring mechanical support from the container walls. Possible applications to the processing of reactive metals are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bojarevics, V.","Roy, A.","Pericleous, K.A.","Topping, B.H.V.","Adam, J.M.","Pallarés, F.J.","Bru, R.","Romero, M.L."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931790,"sim:weight":0.378237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512365,"sim:weight":0.291288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28318,"sim:weight":0.265284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28249,"sim:weight":0.256666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512066,"sim:weight":0.24378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98811,"sim:weight":0.237465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28315,"sim:weight":0.233596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932406,"sim:weight":0.21616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387317,"sim:weight":0.209168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26910,"sim:weight":0.209045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103075,"sim:weight":0.20788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102651,"sim:weight":0.207714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30664,"sim:weight":0.20597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.204016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23127,"sim:weight":0.202433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98555,"sim:weight":0.193752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.193328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98556,"sim:weight":0.190958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98769,"sim:weight":0.188252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631471,"sim:weight":0.186261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Through the use of linear superposition and exploiting symmetry planes the results show that a variety of different flow fields can be achieved. Some of the features exhibited are a global circulation around the dendrite and circulations at the dendrite tips. How these circulations effect the morphology of the dendrite is investigated when the magnetic field is orientated in the (001) direction. Rotation of the preferential direction of growth and an increase in secondary branching are observed and are a consequence of circulations altering surface free energy. A qualitative agreement of these morphological changes is found between a full 3-dimensional model using a moving mesh and a 2-dimensional model using quasi 3-dimensional approximations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kao, A.","Pericleous, K.","Topping, B.H.V.","Adam, J.M.","Pallarés, F.J.","Bru, R.","Romero, M.L."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":105026,"sim:weight":0.332035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145764,"sim:weight":0.273413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98823,"sim:weight":0.248837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2089810,"sim:weight":0.238643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98753,"sim:weight":0.22027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85566,"sim:weight":0.219641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387384,"sim:weight":0.214972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710130,"sim:weight":0.19609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98714,"sim:weight":0.193072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48331,"sim:weight":0.188193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98830,"sim:weight":0.18783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.187749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33738,"sim:weight":0.186508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.186287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108049,"sim:weight":0.185025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77295,"sim:weight":0.179625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664565,"sim:weight":0.177225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98551,"sim:weight":0.173543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46700,"sim:weight":0.167611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98556,"sim:weight":0.167432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The DC magnetic levitation mechanism is considerably different from the AC case [3], where an intense turbulent flow is generated as a consequence of the rotational nature of the electromagnetic force. In DC magnetic levitation the force distribution is a potential function, which permits analytical solutions in particular cases [4]. The dynamic interactions of the flow with the oscillating interface, confined by the magnetic force, are analysed using a multi-physics numerical model for simulating the time dependent liquid metal and the magnetic field generated by currents in the coil system [5]. The numerical simulations demonstrate the possibility of levitating diamagnetic droplets in strictly controllable conditions permitting the material properties measurement from experimental observations.\r\n\r\nTwo different coil arrangements are analysed using the numerical code to model the DC magnetic levitation of a water droplet. The levitation of liquid in controllable conditions is achievable but requires careful optimisation of the electromagnetic and gravity force balance. The fluid velocities, generated by the magnetic force modification due to the liquid surface oscillation in the strong gradient field, are small in magnitude and remain in the laminar regime.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bojarevics, V.","Easter, S.","Pericleous, K.","Topping, B.H.V.","Adam, J.M.","Pallarés, F.J.","Bru, R.","Romero, M.L."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931790,"sim:weight":0.453838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932406,"sim:weight":0.419611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512066,"sim:weight":0.3441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512365,"sim:weight":0.337668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98811,"sim:weight":0.309565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98753,"sim:weight":0.271448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26910,"sim:weight":0.256305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23127,"sim:weight":0.254346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387050,"sim:weight":0.225423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85207,"sim:weight":0.219222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1353112,"sim:weight":0.210803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98697,"sim:weight":0.200649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1651854,"sim:weight":0.197959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387317,"sim:weight":0.190329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269863,"sim:weight":0.189723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.186426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496580,"sim:weight":0.18293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631632,"sim:weight":0.18135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86116,"sim:weight":0.177571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102651,"sim:weight":0.175153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The postgraduate certificate in teaching in the post compulsory sector registers approximately 2,000 students on its part-time, flexible, full time and subject specialist additional diploma courses every year. In addition, 28 Further Education colleges in London work in partnership with Greenwich University to provide these teacher education courses. Over fifty per cent of course participants at Greenwich University belong to Black and Ethnic Minority groups. This paper explores integrating LAMS (Learning Activity Management System) for developing flexible learner centred teaching/learning strategies for the delivery of English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) teacher education programmes. Currently the Additional Diploma (ESOL) subject specialist programme has paper based study guides to support course participants. Feedback from course participants has indicated that the study guides are limited in providing interactive activities,  are text heavy, undifferentiated and do not lend themselves to collaborative work outside the class context. Developing differentiated multimodal activities through LAMS may enable people to engage with course content through a variety of learning preferences and work collaboratively outside the class. By drawing on a pilot project and the work of Burns \u0026 Walker (2009)  this paper will explore the use of LAMS:\r\n\r\n1.\tTo design multimodal and multicultural Additional Diploma (ESOL) resources for supporting active and reflective teaching/ learning practice.\r\n\r\n2.\tAs an e-learning tool that encourages reflective thinking and supports differentiated, \r\nself paced, inclusive and collaborative ESOL teaching/ learning practice .","bibo:AuthorList":["Chopra, Priti"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L Burns and S Walker.

This I claim may open spaces for hearing and acknowledging the voices and silences of gendered adult education subjects speaking for themselves within adult education programme processes. I construct the ‘ideal’ adult education programme as an ‘empty signifier’ (Laclau 1989) in order to create spaces for officially recognising conflict and strategically creating consensus within adult education programme processes. The concept of the empty signifier enables me to move beyond discursive practices framing adult education processes as ‘bottom-up’ learner centred adult education programmes.  I argue that such conceptualisations of adult education programmes create closure and silence around the discursive practices which reveal that any democratic process for adult education programmes does not transcend hegemonic discursive practices.

If they are properly set, relinearization cannot be used to solve this system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhou, Xiaoyi","Ma, Jixin","Du, Wencai","Zhao, Bo","Chen, Mingrui","Zhao, Youngzhe"],"dc:date":"2010-09-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":747068,"sim:weight":0.249408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":649486,"sim:weight":0.229265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23852,"sim:weight":0.209882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664565,"sim:weight":0.205644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387136,"sim:weight":0.201306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43999,"sim:weight":0.188225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931407,"sim:weight":0.182225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53204,"sim:weight":0.177975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":981110,"sim:weight":0.175991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105830,"sim:weight":0.174236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26023,"sim:weight":0.170396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351913,"sim:weight":0.168374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383664,"sim:weight":0.159115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106930,"sim:weight":0.158869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1008795,"sim:weight":0.158715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23336,"sim:weight":0.158553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25904,"sim:weight":0.1577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":918846,"sim:weight":0.152499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98644,"sim:weight":0.152356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":794203,"sim:weight":0.151561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of the study was to quantify and understand the factors influencing provitamin A losses in OFSP dried chips. Losses were determined after drying and storage. A preliminary pilot-scale study demonstrated that carotenoid levels were not significantly different after either solar or sun drying. Field conditions using locally-promoted varieties in Uganda and Mozambique showed losses associated with drying were less than 40%. Flour made from OFSP could therefore be a significant source of provitamin A.  In contrast, storage of chips at room temperature in Uganda for four months resulted in high losses of pro-vitamin A (ca. 70% loss from the initial dried product). Low-cost pretreatments, such as blanching, antioxidants and salting, did not improve carotenoid retention during storage. To understand the cause of the losses, dried sweet potato chips were stored under controlled conditions of temperature (10; 20; 30; or 40ºC), aw (0.1; 0.3; 0.5 or 0.7) and oxygen (0 [under nitrogen]; 2.5; 10 or 21% [air]). Losses in provitamin A were the least during storage at the lowest temperature and oxygen level and at the highest humidity level.  Enzymatic catabolism of beta-carotene in the flour was considered unlikely because of low peroxidase activities at low water activities and the loss of peroxidase activity during storage.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bechoff, Aurélie","Tomlins, Keith","Dhuique-Mayer, Claudie","Dufour, Dominique","Westby, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67035,"sim:weight":0.443314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24544,"sim:weight":0.227352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9837,"sim:weight":0.190929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643700,"sim:weight":0.146206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101607,"sim:weight":0.122017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.121609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.121609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.118375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.118375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.114776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101369,"sim:weight":0.114107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.112382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.111405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.108448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.101276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761116,"sim:weight":0.0999828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99443,"sim:weight":0.0995785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43737,"sim:weight":0.0961777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22742,"sim:weight":0.0950639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29886,"sim:weight":0.0947846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Sun drying of sweetpotatoes is a traditional practice: after drying on rocks crushed or sliced dried sweetpotato are stored in granaries; re-hydrated and boiled to be eaten like fresh roots, or milled into flour to make porridge. Orange\r\nfleshed sweetpotato is being promoted in Africa to tackle vitamin A deficiency. There are inconsistent reports on the effect of sun-drying on pro-vitamin A retention. High losses have been reported which may be associated with the unsaturated instable provitamin A carotenoids easily degraded by light, oxygen and heat (Rodriguez Amaya 1997).

Results from the project indicate these technologies increased independent learning, especially when teachers provided a clear framework by linking to pre-selected, reliable resources, and structured these through appropriate activities. Visual design was highly valued and learners enjoyed using resources containing rich media. In subject disciplines such as Modern Foreign Languages and English they were motivated by the integration of social learning tools, notably forum, glossary tools and chat. Students expected the use of technologies to form a part of their learning.\r\n\r\nSome teachers found that the use of the technologies assisted with long-term planning and enhanced their relationships with students. Adoption of a D4L system is more likely to succeed if introduced as a repository for existing content to which activities are later added and where it supports flexibility, fits the way that practitioners normally plan for learning, integrates easily with F2F teaching, contains a variety of easy to use tools, and accommodates the integration and updating of existing resources created by staff, such as Word, pdf and PowerPoint.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walker, Simon"],"dc:date":"2008-08-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67048,"sim:weight":0.666769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.644799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.607086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.602037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.595903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.595806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.59354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.591855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.562491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.559177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.554449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27100,"sim:weight":0.541721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.531828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.52347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385743,"sim:weight":0.522663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.519887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.518473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631915,"sim:weight":0.50224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.48257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.470707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The British reforms are widely regarded as the benchmark for other reforms and the model used provides the basis for reforms of electricity and other network industries around the world. The factors behind this perception of success are major reductions in the real price of electricity with no apparent reduction in service quality. This paper examines whether the high reputation of the British reforms is justified and whether these good results can be maintained. It concludes that the reputation is not justified and that serious problems are beginning to emerge.\r\n\r\nThe central question that must be asked is: have the British reforms resulted in the creation of efficient markets at the wholesale and retail level? On this criterion, the reforms have failed. The wholesale market remains illusory. Obscure long-term contracts, privileged access to the market and self-dealing within integrated generator/retailers have dominated wholesale purchases leaving the spot markets with minimal liquidity and unreliable prices. The failure to develop an efficient wholesale market places the onus on consumers to impose competitive forces on electricity companies by switching regularly. Small consumers will not do this and they are paying too much for their power.

Evaluation of the effectiveness of a pay system, however, does not take place in a vacuum and relates to the aims and objectives of the pay system concerned. Moreover, evaluation is not an end in itself. It is, therefore, relevant to consider if any further steps were taken as a result of evaluation. Accordingly our research questions were:\r\n• What were the aims and objectives of organisations when introducing new pay arrangements?\r\n• What data did organisations collect and review to inform their evaluation?\r\n• What steps have organisations taken as a result of their evaluation?\r\nWe re-appraised our data from 10 NHS trusts in England which had introduced some innovations in pay and grading in the 1990s. Additionally, we looked at seven multi-site unionised organisations outside the NHS in both the public and private sectors, which had recently made changes to their reward systems, carrying out interviews and inspecting documents.\r\nThe main output is a template for the evaluation of Agenda for Change by NHS organisations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Corby, Susan","White, Geoff","Dennison, Paul","Douglas, Fiona"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67072,"sim:weight":0.830099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316057,"sim:weight":0.740465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383385,"sim:weight":0.685557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93569,"sim:weight":0.654708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42071,"sim:weight":0.634197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93401,"sim:weight":0.538874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67075,"sim:weight":0.525827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46986,"sim:weight":0.520813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.508553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.508087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108603,"sim:weight":0.502844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.499669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93404,"sim:weight":0.49858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.490743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930055,"sim:weight":0.485688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.471959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.471959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.471959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.471959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.471959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In many countries following initial qualification there is little if any opportunity for nurses to benefit from continuing professional development (CPD). This ultimately can lead to stagnation and ritualistic nursing based upon nursing knowledge that is now outdated. Whilst the WHO document ‘Scaling Up, Saving Lives (Global Health Workforce Alliance 2008) focuses upon initial training little is mentioned about CPD provision, however, the International Council of Nursing sees this as a fundamental right of all nurses (ICN 2001) The ‘push-pull’ effect of higher salaries and better working conditions abroad often mean that vitally needed staff are lost to the country that trained them due to a lack of further development opportunities. \r\n\r\nFor those unable to travel abroad, visits from nurse educators and other health care professionals can provide much needed updates. But this is costly in both resources and time and many now question if finances are best used in ways which environmentally also can be seen as detrimental. There is a fear that these visits only perpetuate ‘paternalistic’ attitudes and reflect an unspoken ‘we know best’ attitude. A better way to share knowledge and experiences could be by the many new technologies such as on line discussion forums and virtual tutorials. However, beneficial as these maybe can they ever really replace the interaction that occurs between two or more individuals in a shared face to face interaction?

Using data from 789 publicly listed firms in China during 2000 and 2006, this paper analyzes financing choices of single-segment versus multi-segment firms. The paper finds that corporate diversification into related or unrelated industries has opposite effects on capital structure, after controlling for ownership structure and corporate governance mechanisms unique to China\u0027s transition toward a market economy. Consistent with the prediction of organizational economics, an increase in the degree of business relatedness is associated with a reduction in debt while an increase in business unrelatedness is associated with an increase in debt.  In addition, there is strong evidence that government-controlled firms use less debt financing and that government ownership weakens the positive relationship between unrelated diversification and leverage. Overall, the\r\nempirical results indicate that diversification strategies affect corporate financing choices and that it is important to include ownership structure and governance mechanisms in studies of corporate diversification and capital structure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Su, Larry"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1393846,"sim:weight":0.368462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.334088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109104,"sim:weight":0.328665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.317478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15237,"sim:weight":0.303091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108586,"sim:weight":0.271008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9851,"sim:weight":0.254497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108532,"sim:weight":0.220603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316064,"sim:weight":0.212176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85650,"sim:weight":0.205667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59470,"sim:weight":0.182813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734394,"sim:weight":0.180544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9847,"sim:weight":0.161879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60933,"sim:weight":0.154688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.149855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15207,"sim:weight":0.146545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":197855,"sim:weight":0.108716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337533,"sim:weight":0.0844122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Interviewees\r\nwelcomed the surveys’ regular repetition and thought the\r\nquestionnaires, survey methods and reporting of results,\r\nparticularly inter-organisational benchmark charts, were of\r\na good standard. The survey results were widely used in\r\naction planning and were thought to support organisational\r\npatient-centredness. There was variation in the\r\nextent to which trusts disseminated survey findings to\r\npatients, the public, staff and their board members. The\r\nmost common barrier to using results was difficulty\r\nengaging clinicians because survey findings were not\r\nsufficiently specific to specialties, departments or wards.\r\nLimited statistical expertise and concerns that the surveys\r\nonly covered a short time frame also contributed to some\r\nscepticism.

Far less attention has been paid to Roman Catholic youth organisations in Europe. Yet contemporary images and accounts, for example, from the French family magazine Le Pelerin, in the 1920s, illustrate the psychological significance of  Roman Catholic young people as occupiers of urban space, not only in religious processions (as in a children’s Mass held in the Coliseum in 1923) but in  sporting activities which reflect the international interwar enthusiasm for  developing physical skills in the open air.. \r\n  This paper will draw on newspapers, magazines, local histories and church records to examine the representation of Roman Catholic youth in France in the 1920s and 1930s, within widely differing types of urban space. “Youth organisations” will be broadly defined to include catechumens and communicants’ guilds, as well as national organisations such as the F.G.S.P.F. (Federation gymnastique et sportive des patronages francais, founded in 1898) . Images range from the gymnastic displays of thousands in the Champ de Mars in Paris in 1923, to children and young people in saints’ day processions in small provincial towns. While exploring the links between national identity, religion, discipline and exercise, comparisons will be made with England, where Roman Catholicism was a minority religion. Whereas the Catholic Women’s League Magazine described mass gatherings of Roman Catholic Girl Guides and Boy Scouts in Central London, as well as on private estates, and in local rallies, some advice books encouraged allegiance to the  international Roman Catholic community rather than to the nation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martin, Mary Clare Hewlett"],"dc:date":"2006-08-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108273,"sim:weight":0.318095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382082,"sim:weight":0.294684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60707,"sim:weight":0.222733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109083,"sim:weight":0.206358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710306,"sim:weight":0.205029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43683,"sim:weight":0.192505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46590,"sim:weight":0.192427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108398,"sim:weight":0.178653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108332,"sim:weight":0.178641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108695,"sim:weight":0.177402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383571,"sim:weight":0.175679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382011,"sim:weight":0.174821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44140,"sim:weight":0.174513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.174427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383497,"sim:weight":0.173578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7422,"sim:weight":0.170645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109074,"sim:weight":0.168354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43833,"sim:weight":0.167131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76703,"sim:weight":0.164996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43752,"sim:weight":0.164581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Two types of images are projected.\r\nThe first type are from the collection of images that Mark Ingham has been using for the past few years in his\r\nresearch. These images will occupy the smaller rectangular space at the end of the church. The second type of\r\nimage will use photographs taken over recent months of the inside and outside of Dilston Grove and its locale.\r\nThese latter images will create a site specific installation that will attempt to deconstruct the physical and political dimensions of the space and will be sited in the main body of the building.\r\n\r\n\u0027The Great Art of Light and Darkness\u0027 is the title of a work on optics and the phases of the moon by Athanasius Kircher. Kircher was a leading scholar in his time of natural sciences and mathematics. In 1646 he published the first edition of this book and in it he described\r\na projecting device, equipped with a focusing lens and a mirror, either flat or parabolic.\r\nKircher described the construction of this ‘magic lantern’ by writing:\r\n\"Make ... a wooden box and put on it a chimney, so that the smoke of the lamp in the box is on a level with the opening, and insert in\r\nthe opening a pipe or tube. The tube must contain a very good lens, but at the end of the tube...fasten the small glass plate, on which\r\nis painted an image in transparent water colours. Then the light of the lamp, penetrating through the lens and through the image on the\r\nglass (which is to be inserted... upside down) will throw an upright, enlarged coloured image on the white wall opposite.”\r\nWhen Mark Ingham started to use SLR film cameras as projection devices he wrote: ‘In a blackened out room light from a torch shines\r\nthrough a slide and on through the back of a backless old camera. A transparent, fleeting image captured by this same camera many\r\nyears ago projects outwards from it. A white wall intervenes, to reveal a glowing circle of dappled coloured light.

On Saturday, 25th March, 2006, a conference on \u0027Stop and Search: The Way Forward\u0027 took place in the Civic Suite at Lewisham Town Hall in London. The conference, organised by the Lewisham\r\nCommunity Police Consultative Group (LCPCG), was attended by 125 delegates, of whom 48 gave overwhelmingly positive feedback, with 77% rating the conference as either ‘excellent’ or ‘good’. Key issues emerging from the conference were that the importance and sensitivity of stop\r\nand search to local communities was reinforced. Unfair disproportionality in stop and search practices amongst Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) communities continues to exist. Action must be taken by all parties to reduce this. There is a need for ‘good’ and fair policing, since it is the ‘manner’ of the stop that matters, not the stop itself. The ‘quality’ of the stop and search encounter is vital and needs to rely on respect shown by all parties. Clear accountability of the police and communities in this is essential. Positive demonstration of respect in stop and search is a key issue for people of all ages. The community should encourage this and measure the success of such efforts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jameson, Jill"],"dc:date":"2007-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48361,"sim:weight":0.639599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45050,"sim:weight":0.408846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77960,"sim:weight":0.356531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98725,"sim:weight":0.34968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929826,"sim:weight":0.303335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108621,"sim:weight":0.284832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337374,"sim:weight":0.278649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.27253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44868,"sim:weight":0.265998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89116,"sim:weight":0.257741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.25312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761080,"sim:weight":0.251035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100543,"sim:weight":0.250856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.243001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.24116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778976,"sim:weight":0.233099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53847,"sim:weight":0.22938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.226882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.222753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.2202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The research project aimed to collect and analyse data on ‘trust and leadership’ in the lifelong learning sector (LLS). Using the methodology of case study (Yin, 1994; Stake, 1995), the researchers carried out 18 face to face and telephone interviewees with a range of respondents from and/or working with the sector. Interviewee data was supplemented and cross-checked with Ofsted inspection results and data from a small number of on-line survey results.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrust is a complex concept much explored in previous literature. Research interest in trust has grown during 1980-2008 (Kramer and Tyler, 1996). In these years, flatter,\r\nmore flexible, equitable organisational structures increasingly challenged fixed hierarchical authoritarian leader-focused models. More emphasis on negotiation and\r\nconsensus have highlighted the importance of achieving trust in social relations. Aware of its growing importance, we drew from the literature defining trust as the\r\nwillingness of a person to be vulnerable to the actions of another … based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the trustor,\r\nirrespective of the ability to monitor or control that action (Mayer, Davis and Schoorman, 1995).\r\n\r\nTrust as a psychological state therefore involves confident expectation that others will behave in benevolent rather than detrimental ways. We invest belief in those we trust,\r\ndespite facing dependency, risk and vulnerability about their actions. Our estimations of ‘trustworthiness’ are based on cognitive, social and affective estimations of the\r\ncompetence, benevolence and integrity of the people we trust. Trust inevitably involves the possibility of betrayal. As a result, trust tends to be slowly built and\r\nquickly lost. Trust cannot be ‘bought’ or forced and its beneficial effects are priceless. It is essential for the achievement of excellent leadership situations in which staff feel valued and fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe shift from community to commercialism in the sector identified by Collinson and Collinson (2005), was noted by many of our interviewees, who reported that trust in\r\nthe LLS is increasingly important and ever more fragile. Large-scale government-led initiatives to improve institutional performance in the FE system, notably to deliver its ‘skills-focused’ role, are underway as a result of the FE White Paper (2006), the Leitch Review of Skills (2006) and the government’s response in World Class Skills:\r\nImplementing the Leitch Review of Skills in England (2007). Characterised by ‘new managerialist’ cultures, government scrutiny and continuous audit of performance targets, the LLS faces increasingly stressful, target-orientated demands in a continuously changing top-down policy environment. In this challenging situation, high trust collaborative working environments led by excellent leaders are, in our view, essential for survival.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jameson, Jill","Andrews, Margaret"],"dc:date":"2008-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2794544,"sim:weight":0.469839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930161,"sim:weight":0.466087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101625,"sim:weight":0.369534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67277,"sim:weight":0.315139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383619,"sim:weight":0.298498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43029,"sim:weight":0.297772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77624,"sim:weight":0.278569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.250475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.250475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.250475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.250475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.250475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.250475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.250475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.250475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.250475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.250475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.250475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.250475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.250475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The team-based informal ethos of online collaboration requires a different kind of leadership from that in formal positional hierarchies. Such leadership may be more flexible and sophisticated, capable of encompassing ambiguity and rapid change. Online leaders need to be partially invisible, delegating power and distributing tasks. Yet, simultaneously, online communities are facilitated by the high visibility and subtle control of expert leaders. This paradox: that leaders need to be both highly visible and invisible as appropriate, was derived from prior research and tested in the analysis of online community discussions using a pattern-matching process. It is argued that both leader visibility and invisibility are important for the facilitation of trusting collaboration via distributed leadership. Advanced leadership responses to complex situations in online communities foster positive group interaction and decision-making, facilitated through active distribution of specific tasks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jameson, Jill","Ozok, A.

It discusses theories and definitions of leadership, leader professionalism and post-compulsory education. A collaborative model of professional leadership is recommended, informed by authentic, democratic dialogue with practitioners. Coalitions that foster professional networking and collaborative leadership can be creatively developed through the establishment of intentionally designed communities of leadership practice. The CAMEL (Collaborative Approaches to the Management of e-Learning) JISC infoNet HEFCE/LGM-funded model for communities of practice is discussed as one model which provides a useful template for the development of shared knowledge through professional communities of practice in collaborative leadership. It is argued that this provides a helpful way of enabling and supporting leaders to advance their understanding and ‘know how\u0027 in leadership practices in a sector currently facing significant challenges from demanding external targets and continuous monitoring in an ‘audit culture’.

Data presented provides further evidence for a disturbance in n-6 fatty acid metabolism in MS. Disturbance of n-6 fatty acid metabolism and dysregulation of cytokines are shown to be linked and a \"proof of concept clinical trial\" further supports such a hypothesis. In a randomised double-blind, placebo controlled trial of a high dose and low dose selected GLA (18:3n-6)-rich oil and placebo control, the high dose had a marked clinical effect in relapsing-remitting MS, significantly decreasing the relapse rate and the progression of disease. Laboratory findings paralleled clinical changes in the placebo group in that production of mononuclear cell pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta) was increased and anti-inflammatory TGF-beta markedly decreased with loss of membrane n-6 fatty acids linoleic (18:2n-6) and arachidonic acids (20:4n-6). In contrast there were no such changes in the high dose group. The improvement in disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale) in the high dose suggests there maybe a beneficial effect on neuronal lipids and neural function in MS. Thus disturbed n-6 fatty acid metabolism in MS gives rise to loss of membrane long chain n-6 fatty acids and loss of the anti-inflammatory regulatory cytokine TGF-beta, particularly during the relapse phase, as well as loss of these important neural fatty acids for CNS structure and function and consequent long term neurological deficit in MS.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harbige, Laurence S.","Sharief, Mohammad K."],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26781,"sim:weight":0.428677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23977,"sim:weight":0.428677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26784,"sim:weight":0.396791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269997,"sim:weight":0.390979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9848,"sim:weight":0.384566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385391,"sim:weight":0.339917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269999,"sim:weight":0.324348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386802,"sim:weight":0.315987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9046417,"sim:weight":0.258459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.225835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999745,"sim:weight":0.221485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.216732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.211705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.208635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761116,"sim:weight":0.197204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98535,"sim:weight":0.195149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.194873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81365,"sim:weight":0.190355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734360,"sim:weight":0.18858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.187872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The twenty-nine studies identified for the review examined the effects of breakfast consumption, sugar intake, fish oil and vitamin supplementation and \u0027good diets\u0027. In summary, the studies included in the present review suggest there is insufficient evidence to identify any effect of nutrition, diet and dietary change on learning, education or performance of school-aged children from the developed world. However, there is emerging evidence for the effects of certain fatty acids which appear to be a function of dose and time. Further research is required in settings of relevance to the UK and must be of high quality, representative of all populations, undertaken for longer durations and use universal validated measures of educational attainment. However, challenges in terms of interpreting the results of such studies within the context of factors such as family and community context, poverty, disease and the rate of individual maturation and neurodevelopment will remain. Whilst the importance of diet in educational attainment remains under investigation, the evidence for promotion of lower-fat, -salt and -sugar diets, high in fruits, vegetables and complex carbohydrates, as well as promotion of physical activity remains unequivocal in terms of health outcomes for all schoolchildren.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ells, Louisa J.","Hillier, Frances C.","Shucksmith, Janet","Crawley, Helen","Harbige, Laurence","Shield, Julian","Wiggins, Andy","Summerbell, Carolyn D."],"dc:date":"2008-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":386802,"sim:weight":0.434114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86101,"sim:weight":0.397498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929822,"sim:weight":0.386042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.367001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.36418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.344265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.343097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.343097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.343097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.343097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.343097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.343097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.343097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.343097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.341703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826641,"sim:weight":0.338837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.338462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.338462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.329689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43848,"sim:weight":0.32872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this study, 3 species causing cutaneous leishmaniasis, L. major, L. aethiopica and L. tropica, were tested for their ability to interfere with apoptosis in host macrophages in 2 different lines of human monocyte-derived macrophages (cell lines THP-1 and U937) and the results confirmed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). All 3 species induced early apoptosis 48 h after infection (expression of phosphatidyl serine on the outer membrane). There were significant increases in the percentage of apoptotic cells both for U937 and PBMC following infection with each of the 3 species. Early apoptotic events were confirmed by mitochondrial membrane permeabilization detection and caspase activation 48 and 72 h after infection. Moreover, the percentage of infected THP-1 and U937 macrophages increased significantly (up to 100%) following treatment with an apoptosis inducer. Since phosphatidyl serine externalization on apoptosing cells acts as a signal for engulfment by macrophages, induction of apoptosis in the parasitized cells could actively participate in spreading the infection. In summary, parasite-containing apoptotic bodies with intact membranes could be released and phagocytosed by uninfected macrophages.","bibo:AuthorList":["Getti, G.T.","Cheke, R.A.","Humber, D.P."],"dc:date":"2008-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.412013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.31364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643987,"sim:weight":0.301948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145503,"sim:weight":0.300838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45914,"sim:weight":0.299179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.298823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75685,"sim:weight":0.290034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43460,"sim:weight":0.28323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631640,"sim:weight":0.282186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269995,"sim:weight":0.274817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.272327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.272009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.268623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98707,"sim:weight":0.264011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.258771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.257547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70959,"sim:weight":0.254513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631653,"sim:weight":0.252152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.251268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77087,"sim:weight":0.249482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The melting of sea ice and glaciers is increasing faster than scientists predicted even a year ago. Environmental change is forcing legal and economic developments, which in turn will have serious environmental and social consequences. However, the potential for conflict has been greatly exaggerated. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOS C) has established the international legal regime governing the division of ocean space, sovereign rights over ocean resources, protection of the marine environment and the conduct of activities in and under the Arctic Ocean. Furtherrmore, a number of global environmental and maritime conventions apply to the Arctic. All the land territory, with its resources, is subject to national jurisdiction, as are the maritime zones proceeding seawards to the limits set our in the LOSe. While there is no multilateral political organisation with the power to regulate activities or to take legally binding decisions, there is a cooperative mechanism in the Arctic Council. Once all the maritime boundaries in the Arctic are delimited, the exploitation of resources can begin. However, first, precautionary measures should be adopted to ensure that the environment is protected as much as possible from increases in shipping and fishing as well as oil and gas development. This would require the elaboration of a regional seas agreement for the Arctic, incorporating elements of the Arctic Council, that reiterates the general principles in Part XII of the LOSC as well as those in the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, including the precautionary approach and the ecosystem approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["de La Fayette, Louise Angélique"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":14726,"sim:weight":0.70289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84241,"sim:weight":0.467041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.448962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1494504,"sim:weight":0.437143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98962,"sim:weight":0.423469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271215,"sim:weight":0.422264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14691,"sim:weight":0.396248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.392915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.381854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.381854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108799,"sim:weight":0.376623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112281,"sim:weight":0.373343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2863,"sim:weight":0.355003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84227,"sim:weight":0.351404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99092,"sim:weight":0.350709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.348284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513386,"sim:weight":0.340108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.339307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381989,"sim:weight":0.322341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85220,"sim:weight":0.315296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

They are used widely and do offer a number of tools for instructors to enable them to create and manage courses, however, they do not allow for the learner to have a unique personalised learning experience. The e-Learning platform iLearn offers personalisation for the learner in a number of ways and one way is to offer the specific learning material to the learner based on the learner\u0027s learning style. Learning styles and how we learn is a vast research area. Brusilovsky and Millan [3] state that learning styles are typically defined as the way people prefer to learn. Examples of commonly used learning styles are Kolb Learning Styles Theory [4], Felder and Silverman Index of Learning Styles [5], VARK [6] and Honey and Mumford Index of Learning Styles [7] and many research projects (SMILE [8], INSPIRE [9], iWeaver [10] amonst others) attempt to incorporate these learning styles into adaptive e-Learning systems. This paper describes how learning styles are currently being used within the area of adaptive e-Learning. The paper then gives an overview of the iLearn project and also how iLearn is using the VARK learning style to enhance the platform\u0027s personalisation and adaptability for the learner. This research also describes the system\u0027s design and how the learning style is incorporated into the system design and semantic framework within the learner\u0027s profile.","bibo:AuthorList":["Peter, S.E.","Bacon, E.","Dastbaz, M.","Uhomoibhi, James","Ross, Margaret","Staples, Geoff"],"dc:date":"2009-04-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":969585,"sim:weight":0.693775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7529,"sim:weight":0.662784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384111,"sim:weight":0.632271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98493,"sim:weight":0.620015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.576482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56680,"sim:weight":0.55015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.522219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.519397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14087,"sim:weight":0.509369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109574,"sim:weight":0.506684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98772,"sim:weight":0.499412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.492696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101503,"sim:weight":0.468579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.441437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.436318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.427974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.417754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45717,"sim:weight":0.324411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.319971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931784,"sim:weight":0.317761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

So that not only in literary genres such as epic and tragedy, but also in the novel and comedy, can writing about war be discerned. C.G. Jung,  Shakespeare and Lindsay Clarke are fundamentally writers of war who share allied literary strategies. Moreover, they diagnose similar origins to the malaise of a culture tending to war in the neglect of aspects of the feminine that patriarchy prefers to ignore. In repressing or evading the dark feminine, cultures as dissimilar as ancient Greece, the 21st century, Shakespeare\u0027s England and Jung\u0027s Europe prevent the healing energies of the conjunctio of masculine and feminine from stabilising an increasingly fragile consciousness. In the Troy novels of Clarke, Answer to Job by Jung and Much Ado About Nothing by Shakespeare, some attempt at spiritual nourishment is made through the writing.

To this end housing associations and local authorities are being encouraged to improve the environmental performance of their new and existing homes. Whilst much attention has been focused on new housing (e.g. the Code for Sustainable Homes) little effort has been focussed on improving the 3.9 (approx) million homes maintained and managed by the public sector (in England), which, given the low rate of new build and demolition (\u003c1% in England), will represent approximately 70% of the public housing stock in 2050. Thus, if UK is to achieve sustainable public housing the major effort will have to focus on the existing stock. However, interpreting the sustainability agenda for an existing housing portfolio is not a straight foreword activity. In addition to finding a ‘technical’ solution, landlords also haveto address the socio-economic issues that balance quality of expectations of tenants with the economic realities of funding social housing refurbishment. This paper will report the findings of a qualitative study\r\n(participatory approach) that examined the processes by which a large public landlord sought to develop\r\na long-term sustainable housing strategy. Through a series of individual meetings and group workshops\r\nthe research team identified: committed leadership; attitudes towards technology; social awareness; and\r\ncollective understanding of the sustainability agenda as key issues that the organisation needed to address\r\nin developing a robust and defendable refurbishment strategy. The paper concludes that the challenges\r\nfaced by the landlord in improving the sustainability of their existing stock are not primarily technical, but\r\nsocio-economic. Further, while the economic challenges: initial capital cost; lack of funding; and pay-back\r\nperiods can be overcome, if the political will exists, by fiscal measures; the social challenges: health \u0026 wellbeing;\r\npoverty; security; space needs; behaviour change; education; and trust; are much more complex in\r\nnature and will require a coordinated approach from all the stakeholders involved in the wider community\r\nif they are to be effectively addressed. The key challenge to public housing landlords is to develop\r\nmechanisms that can identify and interpret the complex nature of the social sustainability agenda in a way\r\nthat reflects local aspirations (although the authors believe the factors will exist in all social housing communities, their relative importance is likely to vary between communities) whilst addressing Government\r\nagendas.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Keith","Kaluarachchi, Yamuna"],"dc:date":"2009-04-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60658,"sim:weight":0.604086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18978,"sim:weight":0.591169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.575939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.575939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.575939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.575939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.575939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.575939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.575939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.575939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.575939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.575939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.575939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.575939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.575939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.575939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11078,"sim:weight":0.571269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11076,"sim:weight":0.569066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11075,"sim:weight":0.559949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11080,"sim:weight":0.557084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Jung is a significant resource in negotiating developments in literary theory because of his characteristic treatment of the ‘other’. The paper then looks at The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950) by C.S. Lewis whose own construction of archetypes is very close to Jung’s. By drawing upon new post-Jungian work from Jerome Bernstein’s Living in the Borderland (2005), the novel is revealed to be intimately concerned with narratives of trauma and of origin. Indeed, a Jungian and post-Jungian approach is able to situate the text both within nature and in the historical traumas of war as well as the personal traumas of subjectivity.

The Frequency Agile Microwave Oven Bonding System (FAMOBS) is capable of rapidly processing individual packages on a Chip-On-Board (COB) assembly. This enables each package to be processed in an optimal manner, with temperature ramp rate, maximum temperature and process duration tailored to the specific package, a significant benefit in assemblies containing disparate package types. Such heterogeneous assemblies may contain components such as large power modules alongside smaller modules containing low thermal budget materials with highly disparate processing requirements. The analysis of two disparate packages has been assessed numerically to determine the applicability of the dual section microwave system to curing heterogeneous devices and to determine the influence of differing processing requirements of optimal process parameters.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tilford, Tim","Pavuluri, S.","Bailey, Christopher","Desmulliez, Marc P.Y."],"dc:date":"2009-08-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66994,"sim:weight":0.672844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99295,"sim:weight":0.341863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68143,"sim:weight":0.308628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68067,"sim:weight":0.302706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.290905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68096,"sim:weight":0.289389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17994,"sim:weight":0.286419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.282727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661925,"sim:weight":0.27853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.271559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.265044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.261833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.261833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.261833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.261833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.261833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.261833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.261833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.261833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.261833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

With the ever increasing trend of miniaturisation of electronic products, the study of the rheological properties of solder pastes is becoming an integral part in the R\u0026D of new paste formulations and in the quality monitoring and control during paste manufacture and electronic assembly process. This research work outlines some of the novel techniques which can be successfully used to investigate the rheology of leadfree solder pastes. The report also presents the results of the correlation of rheological properties with solder paste printing performance. Four different solder paste samples (namely\r\npaste P1, P2, P3 and P4) with different flux vehicle systems\r\nand particle size distributions were investigated in the study. As expected, all the paste samples showed shear thinning behaviour. Although the samples displayed similar flow behaviour at high shear rates, differences were observed at low shear rates. In the stencil printing trials, round deposits showed better results than rectangular deposits in terms of paste heights and aperture filling. Our results demonstrate a good correlation between higher paste viscosity and good printing performance. The results of the oscillatory and thixotropy tests were also successfully correlated to the printing behaviour of solder paste.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mallik, Sabuj","Thieme, Jens","Bauer, R.","Ekere, Ndy","Seman, Anton","Bhatti, Rajinderpal","Durairaj, Rajkumar"],"dc:date":"2010-02-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664518,"sim:weight":0.67804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101229,"sim:weight":0.172034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":864374,"sim:weight":0.170127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":909672,"sim:weight":0.168612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933621,"sim:weight":0.162272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24739,"sim:weight":0.161617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99449,"sim:weight":0.15139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386663,"sim:weight":0.147689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18038,"sim:weight":0.13967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98745,"sim:weight":0.132506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631798,"sim:weight":0.129402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43560,"sim:weight":0.112423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77180,"sim:weight":0.110725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43179,"sim:weight":0.108972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.106222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68067,"sim:weight":0.102915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43281,"sim:weight":0.101554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75750,"sim:weight":0.0991518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24705,"sim:weight":0.0980569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933650,"sim:weight":0.0980077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Based on particular assumptions, the effects of some mechanical features of the microchannels on behaviour of the biofluid are explored. These include microchannel, constriction, bending channel, bifurcation as well as channel length ratio between the main and side channels. The key characteristics and effects of the microfluidic dynamics are discussed in terms of separation efficiency of the red blood cells with respect to the rest of the medium. The effects include the Fahraeus and Fahraeus-Lindqvist effects, the Zweifach-Fung bifurcation law, the cell-free layer phenomenon. The characteristics of the microfluid dynamics include the properties of the laminar flow as well as particle lateral or spinning trajectories. In this paper the fluid is modelled as a single-phase flow assuming either Newtonian\r\nor Non-Newtonian behaviours to investigate the effect of the\r\nviscosity on flow and separation efficiency. It is found that, for a flow rate controlled Newtonian flow system, viscosity and outlet pressure have little effect on velocity distribution. When the fluid is assumed to be Non-Newtonian more fluid is separated than observed in the Newtonian case, leading to reduction of the flow rate ratio between the main and side channels as well as the system pressure as a whole.","bibo:AuthorList":["Xue, Xiangdong","Patel, Mayur","Kersaudy-Kerhoas, Maïwenn","Bailey, Christopher","Desmulliez, Marc P.Y.","Topham, David"],"dc:date":"2009-08-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67426,"sim:weight":0.736272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77180,"sim:weight":0.50549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268052,"sim:weight":0.440637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1651854,"sim:weight":0.419847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43560,"sim:weight":0.387704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664565,"sim:weight":0.381015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.359517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631471,"sim:weight":0.355911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102616,"sim:weight":0.353153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75482,"sim:weight":0.338279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43542,"sim:weight":0.328925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98614,"sim:weight":0.324328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102651,"sim:weight":0.318112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108420,"sim:weight":0.317167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99442,"sim:weight":0.30539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98760,"sim:weight":0.302502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335765,"sim:weight":0.298777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18110,"sim:weight":0.294619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98504,"sim:weight":0.293676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26277,"sim:weight":0.277381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The biofluid is modeled with single phase shear rate non-Newtonian flow with blood property. The separation of red blood cell from plasma is evident based on biofluid distribution in the microchannels against various relevant effects and findings, including Zweifach-Fung bifurcation law, Fahraeus effect, Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect and cell free phenomenon. The modeling with the initial device shows that this T-microchannel device can separate red blood cell from plasma but the separation efficiency among different bifurcations varies largely. In accordance with the imbalanced performance, a design optimization is conducted. This includes implementing a series of simulations to investigate the effect of the lengths of the main and branch channels to biofluid behavior and searching an improved design with optimal separation performance. It is found that changing relative lengths of branch channels is effective to both uniformity of flow rate ratio among bifurcations and reduction of difference of the flow velocities between the branch channels, whereas extending the length of the main channel from bifurcation region is only effective for uniformity of flow rate ratio.","bibo:AuthorList":["Xue, Xiangdong","Patel, Mayur K.","Bailey, Chris","Kersaudy-Kerhoas, Maïwenn","Desmulliez, Marc P.Y."],"dc:date":"2009-05-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67425,"sim:weight":0.736272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268052,"sim:weight":0.33792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99173,"sim:weight":0.310852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24953,"sim:weight":0.309051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77180,"sim:weight":0.303637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.291936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664565,"sim:weight":0.291587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335765,"sim:weight":0.283299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26277,"sim:weight":0.265658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99442,"sim:weight":0.25564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43542,"sim:weight":0.253065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98504,"sim:weight":0.238355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98614,"sim:weight":0.236552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68143,"sim:weight":0.225183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":287314,"sim:weight":0.224039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":286381,"sim:weight":0.223489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68067,"sim:weight":0.222481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":287005,"sim:weight":0.22118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45684,"sim:weight":0.218249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.214797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":67432,"ep:Repository":51,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Narrating the archive and archiving narrative: the electronic book and the logic of the index","bibo:abstract":"The creation of my hypermedia work Index of Love, which narrates a love story as an archive of moments, images and objects recollected, also articulated for me the potential of the book as electronic text. The book has always existed as both narrative and archive. Tables of contents and indexes allow the book to function simultaneously as linear narrative and non-linear, searchable database. The book therefore has more in common with the so-called \u0027new media\u0027 of the 21st century than it does with the dominant 20th century media of film, video and audiotape, whose logic and mode of distribution are resolutely linear. My thesis is that the non-linear logic of new media brings to the fore an aspect of the book - the index - whose potential for the production of narrative is only just beginning to be explored. When a reader/user accesses an electronic work, such as a website, via its menu, they simultaneously experience it as narrative and archive. The narrative journey taken is created through the menu choices made. Within the electronic book, therefore, the index (or menu) has the potential to function as more than just an analytical or navigational tool. It has the potential to become a creative, structuring device. This opens up new possibilities for the book, particularly as, in its paper based form, the book indexes factual work, but not fiction. In the electronic book, however, the index offers as rich a potential for fictional narratives as it does for factual volumes.

{"identifier":67455,"ep:Repository":51,"dc:type":["Article","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Spaces of observation and obscurity: cinematic prisons of light and dark","bibo:abstract":"In The Eye of Power, Foucault delineated the key concerns surrounding hospital architecture in the latter half of the eighteenth century as being the ‘visibility of bodies, individuals and things\u0027. As such, the ‘new form of hospital\u0027 that came to be developed ‘was at once the effect and support of a new type of gaze\u0027. This was a gaze that was not simply concerned with ways of minimising overcrowding or cross-contamination. Rather, this was a surveillance intended to produce knowledge about the pathological bodies contained within the hospital walls. This would then allow for their appropriate classification. Foucault went on to describe how these principles came to be applied to the architecture of prisons. This was exemplified for him in the distinct shape of Bentham\u0027s panopticon. This circular design, which has subsequently become an often misused synonym for a contemporary culture of surveillance, was premised on a binary of the seen and the not-seen. An individual observer could stand at the central point of the circle and observe the cells (and their occupants) on the perimeter whilst themselves remaining unseen. The panopticon in its purest form was never constructed, yet it conveys the significance of the production of knowledge through observation that became central to institutional design at this time and modern thought more broadly. What is curious though is that whilst the aim of those late eighteenth century buildings was to produce wellventilated spaces suffused with light, this provoked an interest in its opposite. The gothic movement in literature that was developing in parallel conversely took a ‘fantasy world of stone walls, darkness, hideouts and dungeons…\u0027 as its landscape (Vidler, 1992: 162). Curiously, despite these modern developments in prison design, the façade took on these characteristics. The gothic imagination came to describe that unseen world that lay behind the outer wall. This is what Evans refers to as an architectural ‘hoax\u0027. The façade was taken to represent the world within the prison walls and it was the façade that came to inform the popular imagination about what occurred behind it. The rational, modern principles ordering the prison became conflated with the meanings projected by and onto the façade. This confusion of meanings have then been repeated and reenforced in the subsequent representations of the prison.

Although the common law currently recognises no general property in a dead body (and only limited possessory rights in respect of it), this apparent “no-property rule” provides no justification, it is submitted, for denying proprietary status to parts or products of a living human body. The recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Yearworth v. North Bristol NHS Trust ([2009] EWCA Civ 37) lends strong support to the view that genetic material (as the product of a living human body) is capable of ownership, at least in the context of a claim in the tort of negligence and bailment.

The jet impingement system, outlined by Skuriat et al, consists of a series of cells each containing an array of holes. Cooling fluid is forced through the device, forming an array of impingement jets. The jets are arranged in a manner, which induces a high degree of mixing in the interface boundary layer. This increase in turbulent mixing is intended to induce higher Nusselt numbers and effective heat transfer coefficients. Enhanced cooling efficiency enables the power electronics module to operate at a lower temperature, greatly enhancing long-term reliability. The results obtained through numerical modelling deviates markedly from the experimentally derived data. The disparity is most likely due to the turbulence model selected and further analysis is required, involving evaluation of more advanced turbulence models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rizvi, M.J.","Skuriat, R.","Tilford, Tim","Bailey, Christopher","Johnson, C.

Under cyclic thermal-mechanical loading conditions, the level of damage that occurs in solder joints is assumed to be a simple monotonic scalar function of the accumulated equivalent plastic strain. The increase of damage leads to crack initiation and propagation. By tracking the evolution of the damage level in solder joints, crack propagation path and rate can be simulated using Finite Element Analysis method. The discussions are focused on issues in the implementation of the method. The technique of speeding up the simulation and the mesh dependency issues are analysed.

Computational mechanics is used first to model and simulate the performance of the conceptual design of the micro-probe. Piezoelectric analysis is conducted to understand performance of three different materials - silicon, glassy carbon, and nickel - and the effect of load parameters (amplitude, frequency, phase angle) on the magnitude of vibrations. Simulations are also used to compare several design options for layout of the lead zirconium titanate (PZT) sensors and to identify the most feasible from fabrication point of view design. The material options for the realisation of the device have been also tested. Direct laser machining was selected as the primary means of production. It is found that a Yb MOPA based fiber laser was capable of providing the necessary precision on glassy carbon (GC), although machining trials on Si and Ni were less successful due to residual thermal effects.To provide the active and sensing elements on the flexures of the probe, PZT thick films are developed and deposited at low temperatures (Lt720 degC) allowing a high quality functional ceramic to be directly integrated with selected materials. Characterisation of the materials has shown that the film has a homogenous and small pore microstructure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stoyanov, Stoyan","Bailey, Christopher","Leach, Richard","Hughes, Ben","Wilson, Alan","O\u0027Neill, William","Dorey, Robert","Shaw, Christopher","Underhill, Daniel","Almond, Heather"],"dc:date":"2008-09-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8933135,"sim:weight":0.315367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933864,"sim:weight":0.304951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930756,"sim:weight":0.294636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18042,"sim:weight":0.285619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930797,"sim:weight":0.284715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13183,"sim:weight":0.28018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998119,"sim:weight":0.27992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24705,"sim:weight":0.277007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27088,"sim:weight":0.271162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932434,"sim:weight":0.267057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930975,"sim:weight":0.261213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109133,"sim:weight":0.260882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45018,"sim:weight":0.250739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931268,"sim:weight":0.241972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383506,"sim:weight":0.236759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934045,"sim:weight":0.234999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934837,"sim:weight":0.234397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998516,"sim:weight":0.234186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930862,"sim:weight":0.232768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930868,"sim:weight":0.229287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In order to address this challenge, a risk mitigation methodology that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative analysis is required. This paper outlines the methodology being developed under a major UK grand challenge project - 3D-Mintegration. The main focus is on identifying the risks through identification of the product key characteristics using a product breakdown approach. The assessment of the identified risks uses quantification and prioritisation techniques to evaluate and rank the risks. Traditional statistical process control based on process capability and six sigma concepts are applied to measure the process capability as a result of the risks that have been identified. This paper also details a numerical approach that can be used to undertake risk analysis.

Through this technique, uniform deposition of metal on the side walls of the vias is possible. High frequency acoustic streaming at megasonic frequencies enables the decrease of the Nernst diffusion layer down to the sub-micron range, allowing thereby conformal electrodeposition in deep grooves. This effect enables the normally convection free liquid near the surface to be agitated. Higher throughput and better control of the material properties of the deposits can be achieved for the manufacturing of embedded interconnections and metal-based MEMS. For optimal filling performance of the microvias, a full design of experiments (DOE) and a multi-physics numerical simulation have been conducted to analyse the influence of megasonic agitation on the plating quality of the microvias.

The measured real time data (temperature vs. time) was used as the loading profile for the PoF simulations. The response surface equation of the accumulated plastic strain in the solder interconnect in terms of two variables (average temperature, and temperature amplitude) was constructed. This response surface equation was incorporated into the lifetime model of solder interconnect, and therefore the remaining life time of the solder component under current loading condition was predicted. The predictions from PoF models were also used to calculate the conditional probability table for a Bayesian Network, which was used to take into account of the impacts of the health observations of each product in lifetime prediction. The prognostic prediction in the end was expressed as the probability for the product to survive the expected future usage. As a demonstration, this method was applied to an IGBT power module used for aircraft applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yin, Chunyan","Lu, Hua","Musallam, M.","Bailey, Christopher","Johnson, C.

It is assumed that only one crack is present in the IMC layer. Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) approach is used for parametric study of the Stress Intensity Factors (SIF, KI and KII), at the predefined crack in the IMC layer of solder butt joint tensile sample. Contrary to intuition, it is revealed that a thicker IMC layer in fact increases the reliability of solder joint for a cracked IMC. Value of KI and KII are found to decrease with the location of the crack further away from the solder interfaces while other parameters are constant. Solder thickness and strain rate were also found to have a significant influence on the SIF values. It has been found that soft solder matrix generates non-uniform plastic deformation across the solder-IMC interface near the crack tip that is responsible to obtain higher KI and KII.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alam, M.O.","Lu, Hua","Bailey, Christopher","Chan, Y.C."],"dc:date":"2008-09-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":767758,"sim:weight":0.5024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":967772,"sim:weight":0.362805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85751,"sim:weight":0.242628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":918727,"sim:weight":0.239844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26027,"sim:weight":0.239325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18081,"sim:weight":0.236592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998601,"sim:weight":0.232695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26673,"sim:weight":0.228184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25808,"sim:weight":0.223094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50579,"sim:weight":0.221681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43483,"sim:weight":0.213727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85358,"sim:weight":0.213628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27821,"sim:weight":0.210358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101574,"sim:weight":0.205172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933621,"sim:weight":0.20471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":597529,"sim:weight":0.20375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27055,"sim:weight":0.203671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101421,"sim:weight":0.201512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31674,"sim:weight":0.190971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27098,"sim:weight":0.187647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this article, the heating is considered to be performed by a novel microwave system, able to perform the curing process more rapidly than conventional techniques. Thermal stresses are induced when packages containing materials with differing coefficients of thermal expansion are heated, and cure stresses are induced as thermosetting polymer materials shrink during the cure process. These stresses are developed during processing and remain as residual stresses within the component after the manufacturing process is complete. As residual stresses will directly affect the reliability of the device, it is necessary to assess their magnitude and the effect on package reliability. A coupled multiphysics model has been developed to numercially analyse the microwave curing process. In order to obtain a usefully accurate model of this process, a holistic approach has been taken, in which the process is not considered to be a sequence of discrete steps, but as a complex coupled system.

The dielectric properties of thermosetting polymer materials, commonly used in microelectronics packaging applications, vary significantly with temperature and degree of cure. The heating rate within a material subjected to an electric field is primarily dependant on the dielectric loss properties of the material itself.

Recently, because of the increasing trend of miniaturization of the electronic packaging that encloses the chip, electromigration as well as other high current density induced damages are becoming a growing concern for off-chip interconnection where low melting point solder joints are commonly used. Before long, a huge number of publications have been explored on the electromigration issue of solder joints. However, a wide spectrum of findings might confuse electronic companies/designers. Thus, a review of the high current induced damages in solder joints is timely right this moment. We have selected 6 major phenomena to review in this paper. They are (i) electromigration (mass transfer due electron bombardment), (ii) thermomigration (mass transfer due to thermal gradient), (iii) enhanced intermetallic compound growth, (iv) enhanced current crowding, (v) enhanced under bump metallisation dissolution and (vi) high Joule heating and (vii) solder melting. the damage mechanisms under high current stressing in the tiny solder joint, mentioned in the review article, are significant roadblocks to further miniaturization of electronics.

The reason for this focus of mesh-based codes on separate parts of the governing physics is essentially due to the numerical technologies used to solve the partial differential equations, combined with the subsequent heritage structure in the software codes. Using different software tools, that each requires model build and meshing, leads to a large investment in time, and hence cost, to undertake each of the simulations.

The wire bonded samples were then subjected to thermal cycling in air from -60degC to +150degC. The degradation rate of the wire bonds was assessed by means of bond shear test and via microstructural characterisation. Prior to thermal cycling, the shear strength of all of the wire bonds was approximately equal to the shear strength of pure aluminum and independent of bonding temperature. During thermal cycling, however, the shear strength of room temperature bonded samples was observed to decrease more rapidly (as compared to bonds formed at 100degC and 200degC) as a result of a high crack propagation rate across the bonding area. In addition, modification of the grain structure at the bonding interface was also observed with bonding temperature, leading to changes in the mechanical properties of the wire. The heat and pressure induced by the high temperature bonding is believed to promote grain recovery and recrystallisation, softening the wires through removal of the dislocations and plastic strain energy. Coarse grains formed at the bonding interface after bonding at elevated temperatures may also contribute to greater resistance for crack propagation, thus lowering the wire bond degradation rate","bibo:AuthorList":["Loh, Wei-Sun","Corfield, Martin","Lu, Hua","Hogg, Simon","Tilford, Tim","Johnson, C.

For relatively small data sets, such as diameter at breast height measurements obtained from typical sample plots, distribution models with four or less parameters have been found to be empirically adequate. However, in situations in which the distributions are complex, for example in mixed stands or when the stand has been thinned or when working with aggregated data, then distribution models with more shape parameters may prove to be necessary. By replacing the symmetric standard logistic distribution of the logit-logistic with a one-parameter “standard Richards” distribution and transforming by a five-parameter Richards function, we obtain a new six-parameter distribution model, the “Richit-Richards”. The Richit-Richards includes the “logit-Richards”, the “Richit-logistic”, and the logit-logistic as submodels. Maximum likelihood estimation is used to fit the model, and some problems in the maximum likelihood estimation of bounding parameters are discussed. An empirical case study of the Richit-Richards and its submodels is conducted on pooled diameter at breast height data from 107 sample plots of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.).

The configuration includes a rectangular, high-aspect ratio microchannel with heat sinks, similar to an experimental setup. Water at ambient temperature is used as a coolant fluid and the source of heating is introduced via electronic cartridges in the solids. Two channel heights, measuring 0.3 mm and 1 mm are considered at first. The Reynolds number varies in a range of 500-2200, based on the hydraulic diameter. Simulations are focused on the Reynolds number and channel height effects on the Nusselt number. It is found that the Reynolds number has noticeable influences on the local Nusselt number distributions, which are in agreement with other studies. The numerical predictions of the dimensionless temperature of the fluid agree fairly well with experimental measurements; however the dimensionless temperature of the solid does exhibit a significant discrepancy near the channel exit, similar to those reported by other researchers. The present study demonstrates that there is a significant scaling effect at small channel height, typically 0.3 mm, in agreement with experimental observations. This scaling effect has been confirmed by three additional simulations being carried out at channel heights of 0.24 mm, 0.14 mm and 0.1 mm, respectively. A correlation between the channel height and the normalized Nusselt number is thus proposed, which agrees well with results presented.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yao, Jun","Yao, Yufeng","Patel, Mayur","Mason, Peter J."],"dc:date":"2007-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66992,"sim:weight":0.681619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67512,"sim:weight":0.656845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67004,"sim:weight":0.64253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":315520,"sim:weight":0.622056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67003,"sim:weight":0.590706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67493,"sim:weight":0.556809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.13386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67525,"sim:weight":0.0897162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It also provides powerful underpinning for the emphasis, nay insistence, on reflection as a way of learning and the use of reflective practice in the preparation of students for business and management and other professions. In this paper, we confirm that Kolb’s ELT is still the most commonly cited source used in relation to reflective practice. Kolb himself continues to propound its relevance to teaching and learning in general. However, we also review some of the criticisms that ELT has attracted over the years and advance new criticisms that challenge its relevance to higher education and its validity as a model for formal, intentional learning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dennison, Paul"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":103052,"sim:weight":0.394516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14351,"sim:weight":0.38925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":636355,"sim:weight":0.384528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.375478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14087,"sim:weight":0.366738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.35774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.345292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.343233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269879,"sim:weight":0.334226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383355,"sim:weight":0.334137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.330181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56680,"sim:weight":0.322801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.322012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.317874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104691,"sim:weight":0.314948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46613,"sim:weight":0.301959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.294443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.293806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18068,"sim:weight":0.290231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3216,"sim:weight":0.287404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The resulting impact from a hurricane can include structural damage to buildings and infrastructure, flooding, and ultimately loss of human life. This paper seeks to identify the impact of Hurricane Ivan on the aected population of Grenada, one of the Caribbean islands. Hurricane Ivan made landfall on 7th September 2004 and resulted in 80% of the population being adversely aected. The methods that were used to model these impacts involved performing hazard and risk assessments using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Spatial analyses were used to create a hazard and a risk map. Hazards were identied initially as those caused by storm surges, severe winds speeds, and flooding events related to Hurricane Ivan. These estimated hazards were then used to create a risk map. An innovative approach was adopted, including the use of hillshading to assess the damage caused by high wind speeds. This paper explains in detail the methodology used and the results produced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Khalid, Fakhar","Babb, Renee"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":666224,"sim:weight":0.531686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351243,"sim:weight":0.292072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.266316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.264604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.258387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.258148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.255968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.255968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101629,"sim:weight":0.245175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61873,"sim:weight":0.23704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761079,"sim:weight":0.237008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.236359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.236359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.236359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.236359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.236359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.236359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.236359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.236359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.236359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Questionnaires were distributed in 2005 to a convenience sample of 156 third year nursing students from one pre-registration nursing programme in England. A total of 114 questionnaires were returned, giving an overall response rate of 73.0%.\r\nResults: Fifty one students (44.7% of responses) reported verbal abuse; all of these completed the section exploring reporting behaviours. The incidents involved patients in thirty three cases (64.7%); eight cases (15.7%) involved visitors or relatives and ten cases (19.6%) involved other healthcare workers. Thirty two students (62.7%) stated that they did report the incident of verbal abuse they\r\nexperienced and nineteen (37.3%) of respondents reported that they did not. Only four incidents developed from an oral report to being formally documented. There was a statistically significant association (P \u003d 0.003) between the focus of verbal abuse (patient/visitor or colleague) and the respondents reporting practices with respondents experiencing verbal abuse from colleagues less likely to report incidents. Most frequent feelings following experiences of verbal abuse from colleagues were feelings of embarrassment and hurt/shock. Most frequent consequences of experiencing verbal abuse from patients or relatives were feeling embarrassed and feeling sorry for the abuser. When comparing non reporters with reporters, the most frequent feelings of non reporters were embarrassment and hurt and reporters, embarrassment and feeling sorry for the\r\nabuser. When considering levels of support after the incident the mean rating score of respondents who reported the incident was 5.40 (standard deviation 2.89) and of those that did not, 4.36 (standard deviation 2.87) which was not statistically significant (p \u003d 0.220).\r\nConclusions: 1. Not documenting experiences of verbal abuse formally in writing is a prevalent phenomenon within the sample studied and reporting practices are inconsistent.\r\n2. Both Higher Education Institutions and health care providers should consider emphasising formal reporting and documenting of incidents of verbal abuse during student nurse training and access to formal supportive services should be promoted.\r\n3. Effective incident reporting processes and analysis of these reports can lead to an increased awareness of how to avoid negative interactions in the workplace and how to deal with incidents effectively.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ferns, Terry","Meerabeau, Elizabeth","Needham, Ian","Kingma, Mireille","O\u0027Brien-Pallas, Linda","McKenna, Kevin","Tucker, Rick","Oud, Nico"],"dc:date":"2008-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99018,"sim:weight":0.469198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43866,"sim:weight":0.307051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43609,"sim:weight":0.283715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382087,"sim:weight":0.266942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52200,"sim:weight":0.259123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43546,"sim:weight":0.257923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48236,"sim:weight":0.256155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52204,"sim:weight":0.255876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652016,"sim:weight":0.255472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.254225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53847,"sim:weight":0.252037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.25174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.251675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1649312,"sim:weight":0.250662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44021,"sim:weight":0.246588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.244308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.242929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98462,"sim:weight":0.23799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46560,"sim:weight":0.233004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.226771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aid needed is concentrated in a few countries, and this is affordable for rich countries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hall, David","Lobina, Emanuele"],"dc:date":"2008-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43813,"sim:weight":0.569919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88518,"sim:weight":0.567583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50279,"sim:weight":0.551015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88560,"sim:weight":0.539515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50757,"sim:weight":0.529017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12154,"sim:weight":0.483306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67413,"sim:weight":0.428155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67252,"sim:weight":0.392243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67055,"sim:weight":0.386432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88439,"sim:weight":0.373305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67256,"sim:weight":0.373275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67107,"sim:weight":0.361393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88595,"sim:weight":0.361318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67092,"sim:weight":0.351002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.349802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67405,"sim:weight":0.348699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67056,"sim:weight":0.345289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67414,"sim:weight":0.336752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.335208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67093,"sim:weight":0.330498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":88499,"ep:Repository":51,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"When the shift hits the critical fan: a Foucauldian analysis","bibo:abstract":"In the past 15 years in the UK, the state has acquired powers, which mark a qualitative shift in its relationship to higher education. Since the introduction and implementation of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 and the Higher Education Act 2004, a whole raft of changes have occurred which include the following: Widening participation; the development of interdisciplinary, experiential and workplace-based learning focused on a theory-practice dialogue; quality assurance; and new funding models which encompass public and private partnerships. The transformation of higher education can be placed in the context of New Labour’s overall strategies for overarching reform of public services, as set out in the Prime Minister’s Strategy Unit’s discussion paper The UK Government’s Approach to Public Service Reform (2006).\r\nAn optimistic view of changes to higher education is that they simultaneously obey democratic and economic imperatives. There is an avowed commitment through the widening participation agenda to social inclusion and citizenship, and to providing the changing skills base necessary for the global economy. A more cynical view is that, when put under critical scrutiny, as well as being emancipatory, in some senses these changes can be seen to mobilise regulatory and disciplinary practices. This paper reflects on what kinds of teaching and learning are promoted by the new relationship between the state and the university. It argues that, whilst governmental directives for innovations and transformations in teaching and learning allegedly empower students and put their interests at the centre, reforms can also be seen to consist of supervisory and controlling mechanisms with regard both to our own practices as teachers and the knowledge/ learning we provide for the students.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brunskell-Evans, Heather"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99181,"sim:weight":0.53829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.529749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81239,"sim:weight":0.509843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76964,"sim:weight":0.496873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.485488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45399,"sim:weight":0.484326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51515,"sim:weight":0.474579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55754,"sim:weight":0.462242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.45806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.457539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.452495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.442228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.434703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.434703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.434703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.434703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.434703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.434703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.434703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.434703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":88505,"ep:Repository":51,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Investigating collaborative leadership for communities of practice in learning and skills","bibo:abstract":"This research report on the findings of a collaborative leadership research was funded by the Centre for Excellence in Leadership (CEL) at Lancaster University in 2006-07. The project aimed to collect and analyse data on ‘collaborative leadership’ (CL) in the learning and skills sector (LSS). The project investigated ‘collaborative leadership’ and its potential for benefiting staff through trust and knowledge sharing in communities of practice (CoPs). The project complemented CEL’s ongoing work in the Collaboration in Leadership programme (CiL), aiming to promote advantageous aspects of CL and avoid possible pitfalls. Using an online survey research design, the project collected 221 survey responses on ‘collaborative leadership’ from a range of participants in or connected with the sector.‘Collaborative leadership’ has increasingly gained international prominence as emphasis has shifted towards team leadership approaches beyond zero-sum ‘leadership’/’followership’ polarities into mature conceptions of shared leadership spaces, within which synergistic collaboration may be mediated. The relevance of collaboration to the LSS has been highlighted following the 2006 FE White Paper. The promotion of CL addresses concerns about the apparent ‘remoteness’ of some senior managers, and ‘neo-management’ control of professionals which increases ‘distance’ between leaders and ‘followers’ and may de-professionalise staff. Positive benefit from ‘collaborative advantage’ tends to be assumed in idealistic interpretations of CL, but potential ‘collaborative inertia’ may be problematic in a sector characterised by topdown policy changes. Constant pressure for achievement against goals leaves little time for democratic group negotiations, despite the desires of leaders to create a collaborative ethos.

This paper reports on 21 e-learning case studies collected by the JISC-funded UK eLIDA CAMEL Design for Learning Project. The project implemented and evaluated learning design (LD) tools in higher and further education within the JISC Design for Learning pedagogic e-learning programme in 2006-07. Project partners carried out user evaluations on innovative tools with a learning design functionality, collecting design for learning case studies and LD sequences in a range of post-16/HE contexts using LAMS and Moodle. The project brought together learning activity sequences from post-16/HE partners into a collaborative e-learning community of practice based on the CAMEL (Collaborative Approaches to the Management of e-Learning) model, contributing to international developments in design for learning. This paper briefly provides an overview of the key project outputs in terms of their contribution to e-learning innovations, including evaluation results from teachers and students using online surveys. The paper explores intentionality in the development of a community of practice in design for learning, reporting on trials of learning design and social software in bridging tensions between formalised intra-institutional e-learning relationships and inter-institutional project team dynamic D4L practitioner development. Following a brief report of practitioner D4L e-learning case studies and student feedback, the catalytic role of the \u0027critical friend\u0027 is highlighted and recommended as a key ingredient in the successful development of a nomadic model of communities of practice in the management of e-learning projects. eLIDA CAMEL Partners included the Association of Learning Technology (ALT), JISC infoNet, three universities and five FE/Sixth Form Colleges. Results reported to the UK JISC Experts\u0027 Pedagogy Group demonstrated e-learning innovations by practitioners in D4L case studies, illuminated by the role of the \u0027critical friend\u0027, Professor Mark Stiles of Staffordshire University. The project also benefited from case study evaluations by Dr Liz Masterman of Oxford University Learning Technologies Group and the leading work of ALT and JISC infoNet in the development of the CAMEL model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jameson, Jill","Remenyi, Dan"],"dc:date":"2008-06-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67269,"sim:weight":0.624474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105141,"sim:weight":0.563358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33683,"sim:weight":0.559003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341327,"sim:weight":0.542504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.529897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.51679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.480194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106770,"sim:weight":0.478852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18076,"sim:weight":0.45889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6250,"sim:weight":0.436657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.423703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.421013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.413532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.413514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.41074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5662,"sim:weight":0.407522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104691,"sim:weight":0.403175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.391624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930934,"sim:weight":0.379682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.377933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It has been estimated that there are approximately 10,000 gatherers of Devil\u0027s Claw in southern Africa who are also among the poorest and most vulnerable of its communities. Furthermore, a value chain has formed over time which seems to have resulted not only in significantly reduced terms of trade for the gatherers but also environmental degradation as a result of over harvesting.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a group of government and non-state representatives formed the Devil\u0027s Range State Working Group (DRSWG) comprising representatives from the Kalahari eco-zone: Namibia, Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe and RTFP is now working with them to promote improved livelihoods for the gatherers through enhancements in the value chain for their product.\r\n\r\nThis paper is a feasibility study, which was carried out and which identified what causes low prices at the level of the harvester and what might be done to promote a value chain which is more equitable. A secondary objective of the feasibility study was to better understand how the power and governance of value chains limits the potential benefits of regional and international trade integration.\r\n\r\nInitial conclusions were that value chains should be upgraded and traceability systems introduced through \u0027stewardship\u0027 contracts entered into between regional exporters, traders, permit issuing authorities and harvesters.

In the energy sector, there are many developments that unions must consider\r\nas they plan for the next few years.\r\nThe most important trend is the complex and deep problems with the privatisation and deregulation model\r\nimposed by the international financial institutions. This neo-liberal approach to the serious challenges of\r\nsupplying safe and reliable energy to citizens, to industry and to agriculture has proven to be weaker even\r\nthat the public service model that it sought to replace.\r\nThe report indicates that many of the multinational corporations that rushed in as agents of the IFIs have run\r\naway or are looking for the first opportunity to get out. This may mean that unions will have a difficult time\r\nnegotiating long-term collective agreements with them, that no money will be available for salary increases,\r\nor that these MNCs will attempt to cut jobs in order to squeeze last-minute profits. However, it also means\r\nthat the unions can put pressure on the companies by letting the communities and the politicians know of the\r\ncorporate plans to leave.\r\nWe can conclude from this research that unions will find it easier to resist energy privatisation, at least for\r\nthe short term. However, in the long term, it is safe to assume that the IFIs will return to their neo-liberal,\r\nmarket-based attacks on the public sector. Thus, unions must develop long term solutions to protect public\r\nservices.\r\nPossibly the best way to resist privatisation is to ensure that the public services are of a high quality, and that\r\nthey meet the needs of the public. This can perhaps be achieved through a variety of tools: labourmanagement\r\ncooperation to reform and improve public services; workers and users taking a greater role in\r\ndecision-making; governments investing in public infrastructure. Such an approach will require new\r\nstrategies and new alliances.

{"identifier":88609,"ep:Repository":51,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Higher than what?","bibo:abstract":"With its world heritage site Greenwich can potentially create a university that combines the best of the old with something new. That this does not happen automatically shows that the French sociologist of education, Pierre Bourdieu, was wrong in his contention that higher education is all form and no substance. But what is the substance of ‘higher’ learning? Higher than what? Further than where? as Sir Toby Weaver, author of our 1965 Woolwich Polytechnic speech, asked.\r\nSome would answer that higher education’s (HE) ‘higherness’ comes from specialisation but this is also the case in further education (FE). Others would assert academic freedom allows HE teachers to set their own courses linked to their research interests. However, although there is not (yet) a National Curriculum for HE, many programmes of study have long been agreed with professional bodies. And in an institution where the main activity of most staff is teaching or supporting teaching, research and scholarship exist, we admit, only in ‘pockets’. So this is not distinctive either.\r\nTherefore, when we are pushed to characterise ‘higherness’, we fall back on what we often look for in student assignments: A critical analysis of the information required. This is seen as ‘deep’ rather than ‘surface’ knowledge. Yet these tacit notions are often confused so that we know them when we see them but find them hard to justify explicitly. This contribution to Greenwich’s new pedagogic journal seeks to do this as simply as possible in the interests of stimulating debate and innovation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ainley, Patrick"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":51515,"sim:weight":0.60529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.59577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.59514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78564,"sim:weight":0.583932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.583786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709519,"sim:weight":0.583642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108230,"sim:weight":0.57512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.56105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.544082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18050,"sim:weight":0.535784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.533059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.529663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76964,"sim:weight":0.529274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.521666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.515274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101495,"sim:weight":0.497875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.490022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101576,"sim:weight":0.481544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.480204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46621,"sim:weight":0.472118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The authors note the findings of previous research indicating a gap between teachers’ stated intention to reuse others’ materials and the practicalities of reuse, and comment on the shortcomings of both Wenger’s communities of practice and Hung and Nichani’s quasi-communities as models of the types of community that might foster the reuse of learning designs. They suggest that another model is needed to address the ‘scaffolding’ of teachers into the practice of sharing. To explore both themes, the authors then present an investigation into the reusability of learning designs. This was set in the context of a regional initiative, within the London Borough of Greenwich, to support students’ development of study skills through blended learning. Questions raised by the findings include the cost-benefits of adaptation versus creation of one’s own learning designs, and the reusability of designs created ‘in the abstract.’ The authors conclude by introducing the CAMEL model of collaboration as a potential means to overcome the discrepancy between the theory and reality of reuse through establishing relationships of trust mediated by both online and faceto-face communication.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walker, Simon","Masterman, Elizabeth","Philip, R.","Voerman, A.","Dalziel, J."],"dc:date":"2006-12-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.378164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.348218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105141,"sim:weight":0.346204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.34494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.343317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5162,"sim:weight":0.340342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104691,"sim:weight":0.338387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85720,"sim:weight":0.338075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.333542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67048,"sim:weight":0.3309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.320822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.317557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.31334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.313187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.309487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.300657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.295139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.285033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.284553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.271391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the latest trends in control systems applications express additional requirements regarding increased flexibility and ability to adjust to changing environment conditions. This results in a combination of classic control algorithms with various modern techniques of supervision and control which leads to design of hierarchical multilayer computer control systems. In some cases, depending on deployment environment, there may appear some constraints or additional requirements to be satisfied, which may reduce the range of possible solutions. This applies especially to embedded systems, where resource constraints are always an issue which has to be taken into account.\r\nThis paper presents a new architecture for control systems with hierarchical exact state observers.

There is an increasing interest in, and need\r\nfor, solutions which give these systems the ability to adjust their behaviour to the current environment conditions. Although context-awareness and self-configuration features are obvious responses to the needs mentioned, each potential implementation of them is inevitably a compromise between level of flexibility achieved and the accompanying resource costs. This\r\nbalance is especially vital in the case of resource constrained embedded systems, which dominate in many application domains. In this situation it is extremely important to provide solutions for which the resource configuration can be accurately predicted for a given scenarios, and thus validation can be extended beyond behavioural correctness, to include real-time\r\nperformance characteristics and resource usage such as memory, even though the precise operating circumstances may be unknown in advance.\r\nIn this paper we present a middleware architecture and accompanying software component model supporting self-configuration, context-awareness and dynamic decision making within embedded systems.

These dimensions resonate with the meaning in life concept as\u003d understood by Frankl (1963) and the panoply of subsequent theoretical definitions (e.g. Battista and Almond 1973). Study 2 used these results as a foundation for developing a psychometrically satisfactory self-report questionnaire of each of these aspects of meaning in life. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) validated a five-factor structure, with each factor loading on a common second-order factor. Study 3 provided evidence for this new measure’s convergent validity and economic property.

This article reports on the implementation of the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) program, a large social experiment in the United Kingdom. Procedures to elicit informed consent were generally scrupulously followed, but even so many participants appeared to have only limited understanding of the experiment and their involvement in it. The reasons for this are articulated and recommendations are made to help ensure, to the extent possible, that potential random assignment study participants adequately understand their situation and their choices","bibo:AuthorList":["Walker, Robert","Hoggart, Lesley","Hamilton, Gayle"],"dc:date":"2008-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1923737,"sim:weight":0.370742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99241,"sim:weight":0.300046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60263,"sim:weight":0.284653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103821,"sim:weight":0.284653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17976,"sim:weight":0.254909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930834,"sim:weight":0.219441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43228,"sim:weight":0.214057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664520,"sim:weight":0.19278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.192625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99204,"sim:weight":0.191322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1925287,"sim:weight":0.188241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.18824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105340,"sim:weight":0.187366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.182411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.182393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.181082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.178332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.178332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.178332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.178332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It finds a low level of regulatory independence and competence, a high level of cross-country variations in regulatory quality, and widespread absence of correlation between ex ante regulatory quality and ex post performance indicators. On the basis of these findings, it suggests that the design of national regulatory agencies (NRAs) in Europe is not optimal and may be conducive to regulatory ineffectiveness or outright regulatory failure. Nevertheless, the existence and strengthening of EU-level regulators could enable EU member states to reduce the risk of regulatory failure by encouraging coordination and adoption of best practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ugur, Mehmet"],"dc:date":"2009-12-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5080727,"sim:weight":0.647758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67014,"sim:weight":0.646467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45534,"sim:weight":0.419711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.402049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99091,"sim:weight":0.37973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.35845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.351297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929841,"sim:weight":0.343064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.337785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77832,"sim:weight":0.330541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.329605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.329605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.329605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.329605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.329605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.329605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.329605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.329605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.329605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.329605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It will provide a forum for sharing the widely differing applications and extensions of the conversation partner scheme and its potential to contribute to healthcare initiatives, service delivery and clinical education. The three participants are from two universities offering speech and language therapy training and from Connect, the Communication Disability Network and in setting up this symposium we are demonstrating the value of collaborative work drawing together experiences of clinical educators, practitioners, people with aphasia and the voluntary sector. The first paper will describe a study undertaken by the lead discussant into the application of conversation partner training with speech and language therapy students on the Postgraduate Diploma in Speech and Language Therapy run collaboratively by the University of Greenwich and Canterbury Christ Church University. This study set out to explore the impact of this experience on the students’ development of and reflection on their own communication and interaction skills. The study measured the changes in the students’ confidence levels, and describes the stages of the process that the students go through in increased awareness of their own communication skills. The implications for this on further development of student learning will be discussed along with the potential application for inter-professional learning. The second paper explores the potential of Conversation Partner Training to increase activity within the university and the local health economy. At the University of East Anglia the relationship between Conversation Partner Training and the university institution is being developed through a number of related activities, and the paper will examine how this development impacts on group identity and the experiences of stakeholders in the initiative. The study described used exploratory workshops, presentations and facilitated group discussions to develop a group focus and progress group identity. The study reports on work with service users, medical, physiotherapy and occupational therapy students. The third paper explores the impact and learning from working with people with aphasia as volunteer befrienders within the framework of a conversation partner scheme. It reports on a pilot training scheme modelled on the scheme for training conversation partners. It looks at how the training, resources and supervision needed modifying, but with modification how this effectively equipped the volunteers with aphasia to go on and visit others. The paper will draw on the accounts of the volunteers’ experiences and the learning they have shared including ways in which they have supported other people with aphasia to set up similar befriending ventures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stokes, Jane","Horton, Simon","McVicker, Sally"],"dc:date":"2009-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":105133,"sim:weight":0.371642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.368612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.366348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.364852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.361816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.358723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.358649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.356395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.337884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.337027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.336889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.328949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.322248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55530,"sim:weight":0.319203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88253,"sim:weight":0.31879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.309453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.307177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.30518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145895,"sim:weight":0.290958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108848,"sim:weight":0.289653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A consequence is a limited knowledge base to inform health and education professional practice and provision to this group of children and their families.  It is possible that early years professionals in the absence of knowledge draw on ‘common sense’ and ‘universal norms of language development’ associated with monolingual notions of language socialisation.  \r\n“Socialization, broadly defined, is the process through which a child or other novice acquires the knowledge, orientations, and practices that enable him or her to participate effectively and appropriately in the social life of a particular community. This process—really a set of densely interrelated processes—is realized to a great extent through the use of language, the primary symbolic medium through which cultural knowledge is communicated and instantiated, negotiated and contested, reproduced and transformed.”  (Garrett \u0026 Baquedano-López ¬2002).\r\nThere is a rich body of literature on language socialisation of children in families the UK and internationally.  This work is largely concerned with language socialisation of typically developing children, in established monolingual or multilingual social contexts.  There are some studies about language socialisation with children who have communication disabilities (autism and substantial learning difficulties) but they are not with young children or necessarily based in the home.  \r\nIn this paper we will review key studies of language socialisation across languages, cultures and disability and examine methodological issues that are raised when researching early multilingual socialisation around language disability.  We will draw out the implications for undergraduate and postgraduate training and for professional development and practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martin, Deirdre","Stokes, Jane"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382759,"sim:weight":0.355755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48240,"sim:weight":0.35511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2852,"sim:weight":0.337019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82298,"sim:weight":0.308383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101576,"sim:weight":0.299079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48326,"sim:weight":0.294797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.294626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.287868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.278745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709915,"sim:weight":0.278509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77112,"sim:weight":0.274756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.266798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98855,"sim:weight":0.266698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.265819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.259933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.256617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145895,"sim:weight":0.256273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.253249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45957,"sim:weight":0.244556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17849,"sim:weight":0.24225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At the inter-organizational level, at least two different sociological traditions deal with the issue of governance of markets, stressing either formal and often exogenous aspects, or informal and endogenous ones. For the first tradition, a socio-legal one, exogenous governance (see for example Ayres and Braithwaite, 1992; Hawkins, 1984; Hawkins and Thomas, 1984; Shapiro, 1984; Weait, 1993; Weaver, 1977) is provided by government agencies backed up by courts. These studies focus, for example, on the decision by government agencies to prosecute deviant companies. Such decisions are not straightforward and they often come out of tradeoffs between official inspectors and company managers. This is especially the case when they face risks such as large-scale losses and layoffs, and sometimes bankruptcy, should the law be strictly enforced. The second tradition focuses on inter-firm arrangements promoting self-governance benefits for firms in their transactions and more informal conflict resolution mechanisms. Because litigation is costly, firms sometimes prefer unofficial dispute resolution whenever possible, especially when they have long term continuing relationships (see for example Macaulay, 1963, 1986; Raub and Weesie, 1993, 1996, 2000; Rooks et al., 2000; Buskens et al., 2003). Here the focus is on pressures to conform by one organization on the other. Pressures are based on resource dependencies and reputation. Thus, these two traditions focus on different kinds of actors intervening in governance, the State and companies themselves –the latter sometimes through industry representatives.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tubaro, Paola","Lazega, Emmanuel","Mounier, Lise"],"dc:date":"2010-06-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47250,"sim:weight":0.370866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.343103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43805,"sim:weight":0.257139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106040,"sim:weight":0.245668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.242913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.237545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76162,"sim:weight":0.237469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387410,"sim:weight":0.229135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":361620,"sim:weight":0.221733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381926,"sim:weight":0.207879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101499,"sim:weight":0.206056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98929,"sim:weight":0.201159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":882418,"sim:weight":0.201072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43838,"sim:weight":0.199639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43497,"sim:weight":0.196919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45534,"sim:weight":0.193528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109178,"sim:weight":0.189277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710664,"sim:weight":0.187324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145598,"sim:weight":0.186098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77362,"sim:weight":0.182258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The paper proposes a methodology which includes a longitudinal study of three UK case studies in the four year run-up to the 2012 Olympics. These case studies (London Borough of Greenwich, Canterbury and Durham) will be the subject of quantitative and qualitative analysis which the authors hope will reveal valuable insights into the frequency, transmission and longevity of the identified memes.

Statistically significant first- and higher-order autocorrelations were found in the series. Although endogenous components captured much of the variance, adding rainfall data improved endogenous ARIMA models and resulted in more realistic forecasts. Using a square-root transformation for the locust data improved the fit. The models were only partially successful when accounting for the dramatic changes in abundance which may occur during locust upsurges and declines, in some cases successfully predicting these phenomena but underestimating their severity. Better fitting models were also produced when rainfall data were added to models of an equivalent series for desert locust hoppers (nymphs) that incorporated lagged data for locust swarms as independent variables, representing parent generations. The results are discussed in relation to predicting likely changes in desert locust dynamics with reference to potential effects of climate change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tratalos, Jamie A.","Cheke, Robert A.","Healey, Richard G.","Stenseth , Nils Chr."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":31924,"sim:weight":0.282146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.2518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.2518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32039,"sim:weight":0.23934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.228282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.227738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.226284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.221324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.220034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.210952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.210952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.210952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.210952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.210952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.210952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.210952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.210952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.210952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.210952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.210952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A simple scaling analysis, supported by experimental measurements on typical wind-pollinated plant species, is used to estimate the suitability of previous resolutions of this paradox based on wind-gust aerodynamic models of fungal-spore liberation. According to this scaling analysis, the steady Stokes drag force is found to be large enough to liberate anemophilous pollen grains, and unsteady boundary-layer forces produced by wind gusts are found to be mostly ineffective since the ratio of the characteristic viscous time scale to the inertial time scale of acceleration of the wind stream is a small parameter for typical anemophilous species. A hypothetical model of a stochastic aeroelastic mechanism, initiated by the atmospheric turbulence typical of the micrometeorological conditions in the vicinity of the plant, is proposed to contribute to wind pollination.","bibo:AuthorList":["Urzay, Javier","Llewellyn Smith, Stefan G.","Thompson, Elinor","Glover, Beverley J."],"dc:date":"2009-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98833,"sim:weight":0.387957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65404,"sim:weight":0.377785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98555,"sim:weight":0.334948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50125,"sim:weight":0.315591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17916,"sim:weight":0.307137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17966,"sim:weight":0.286003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81247,"sim:weight":0.281417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108393,"sim:weight":0.271772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101466,"sim:weight":0.268917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98593,"sim:weight":0.255823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98553,"sim:weight":0.250704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108758,"sim:weight":0.24382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98556,"sim:weight":0.230527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98545,"sim:weight":0.227846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.213814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108633,"sim:weight":0.199798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108096,"sim:weight":0.183364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63162,"sim:weight":0.179446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30664,"sim:weight":0.179385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44054,"sim:weight":0.176331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The signalling events may be unique to higher plants, as they lack animal purinoceptor homologues. Although it is known that plant cytosolic free Ca2+ can be elevated by extracellular ATP, the mechanism is unknown. Here, we have studied roots of Arabidopsis thaliana to determine the events that lead to the transcriptional stress response evoked by extracellular ATP. Root cell protoplasts were used to demonstrate that signalling to elevate cytosolic free Ca2+ is determined by ATP perception at the plasma membrane, and not at the cell wall. Imaging revealed that extracellular ATP causes the production of reactive oxygen species in intact roots, with the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase AtRBOHC being the major contributor. This resulted in the stimulation of plasma membrane Ca2+-permeable channels (determined using patch-clamp electrophysiology), which contribute to the elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+. Disruption of this pathway in the AtrbohC mutant impaired the extracellular ATP-induced increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), the activation of Ca2+ channels, and the transcription of the MAP kinase3 gene that is known to be involved in stress responses. This study shows that higher plants, although bereft of purinoceptor homologues, could have evolved a distinct mechanism to transduce the ATP signal at the plasma membrane.","bibo:AuthorList":["Demidchik, Vadim","Shang, Zhonglin","Shin, Ryoung","Thompson, Elinor","Rubio, Lourdes","Laohavisit, Anuphon","Mortimer, Jennifer C.","Chivasa, Stephen","Slabas, Antoni R.","Glover , Beverley J.","Schachtman, Daniel P.","Shabala, Sergey N.","Davies, Julia M."],"dc:date":"2009-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46893,"sim:weight":0.277407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77510,"sim:weight":0.213945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384482,"sim:weight":0.212946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57331,"sim:weight":0.209978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631920,"sim:weight":0.206014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":951464,"sim:weight":0.201035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145468,"sim:weight":0.193644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1008902,"sim:weight":0.190041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":859164,"sim:weight":0.186467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107415,"sim:weight":0.177112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1008876,"sim:weight":0.166556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145628,"sim:weight":0.165765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85343,"sim:weight":0.161932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2771232,"sim:weight":0.152374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767911,"sim:weight":0.151703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573478,"sim:weight":0.148662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81284,"sim:weight":0.147812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386959,"sim:weight":0.144391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768010,"sim:weight":0.144057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777404,"sim:weight":0.142959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For example, in a recent paper, the authors proposed a classical graph partitioning algorithm to optimize the assignment of cells to Packet Control Units (PCUs) in GSM-EDGE Radio Access Network. Based on this approach, the quality of packet data services in a live environment was increased by reducing the number of cell re-selections between different PCUs. To learn more about the potential of graph partitioning in cellular networks, in this paper, a more sophisticated, yet computationally efficient, partitioning algorithm is proposed for the same problem. The new method combines multi-level refinement and adaptive multi-start techniques with algorithms to ensure the connectivity between cells under the same PCU. Performance assessment is based on an extensive set of graphs constructed with data taken from a live network. During the tests, the new method is compared with classical graph partitioning approaches. Results show that the proposed method outperforms classical approaches in terms of solution quality at the expense of a slight increase in computing time, while providing solutions that are easier to check by the network operator.","bibo:AuthorList":["Toril, Matías","Molina-Fernández, Iñigo","Wille, Volker","Walshaw, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2010-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":929852,"sim:weight":0.435935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43308,"sim:weight":0.241135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108624,"sim:weight":0.224765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2150032,"sim:weight":0.218786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26670,"sim:weight":0.218083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":398287,"sim:weight":0.211051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102618,"sim:weight":0.210464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.20637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68143,"sim:weight":0.200517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102730,"sim:weight":0.199904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43550,"sim:weight":0.196503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1024014,"sim:weight":0.193322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931813,"sim:weight":0.188034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1056867,"sim:weight":0.18534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145958,"sim:weight":0.185151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1568724,"sim:weight":0.184813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931792,"sim:weight":0.178986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931690,"sim:weight":0.175113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98569,"sim:weight":0.174757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":902013,"sim:weight":0.174686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this presentation I explore how research into whistleblowing and regulatory developments around the issue, impact the validity of notions of responsibility in the context of whistleblowing. Research during the 1990s has rendered the assumed dilemma of citizen responsibility and employee responsibility obsolete. The implications are that internal and external whistleblowing belong in the same behavioural category, and that hence the ‘one million dollar question’ with regard to responsibility shifts from the whistleblower to the manager.\r\n\r\nIn the past thirty years numerous pieces of legislation have been passed to offer protection to whistleblowers from retaliation for disclosing organisational wrongdoing. An area that remains uncertain in relation to whistleblowing and its related policies in organisations, is whether these policies actually increase the individualisation of work, allowing employees to behave in accordance with their conscience and in line with societal expectations or whether they are another management tool to control employees and protect organisations from them. I examine the assumptions of whistleblower protection with regard to moral autonomy, and submit that this makes employees not just responsible, but also liable for ethics at work.\r\n\r\nBoth shifts open up new research paths into responsibility in the contexts of organisations and whistleblowing. I conclude by briefly sketching these.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vandekerckhove, Wim"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48300,"sim:weight":0.211038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664727,"sim:weight":0.197277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101228,"sim:weight":0.177797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101178,"sim:weight":0.162174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000059,"sim:weight":0.153968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108339,"sim:weight":0.153933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108984,"sim:weight":0.153515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.153327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44844,"sim:weight":0.152741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.149698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708259,"sim:weight":0.148661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.148419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794544,"sim:weight":0.142621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108027,"sim:weight":0.140268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103149,"sim:weight":0.139588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108921,"sim:weight":0.138755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98465,"sim:weight":0.134186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85702,"sim:weight":0.131961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383355,"sim:weight":0.131771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47126,"sim:weight":0.130242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Differing from the traditional reliability prediction methods, this approach allows the reliability performance of PEMs to be assessed in real time. Firstly, a compact thermo-mechanical model of the solder interconnect was constructed using both high-fidelity and reduced order computer modeling, it was then integrated with the lifetime model of the solder joint. Secondly, a real time compact electro-thermal model was developed using both experimental and computer modeling techniques, and was used to predict the temperatures of device junctions, interfaces etc. that cannot ordinarily be measured during service.

The design methodology is used to identify the optimal design of lead-free (Sn3.9Ag0.6Cu) solder joints in fine-pitch copper column bumped flip-chip electronic packages. Design/methodology/approach – The design methodology is generic and comprises numerical techniques for computational modelling (finite\r\nelement analysis) coupled with numerical methods for statistical analysis and optimisation. In this study, the integrated optimisation-modelling design strategy is adopted to prototype virtually a fine-pitch flip-chip package at the solder interconnect level, so that the thermal fatigue reliability of the leadfree solder joints is improved and important design rules to minimise the creep in the solder material, exposed to thermal cycling regimes, are formulated. The whole prototyping process is executed in an automated way once the initial design task is formulated and the conditions and the settings for the numerical analysis used to evaluate the flip-chip package behaviour are specified. Different software modules that incorporate the required numerical techniques are used to identify the solution of the design optimisation problem related to solder joints reliability optimisation.\r\nFindings – For fine-pitch flip-chip packages with copper column bumped die, it is found that higher solder joint volume and height of the copper column combined with lower copper column radius and solder wetting around copper column have a positive effect on the thermo-mechanical\r\nreliability.\r\nOriginality/value – The findings of this research provide design rules for more reliable lead-free solder joints for copper column bumped flip-chip packages and help to establish further the technology as one of the viable routes for flip-chip packaging.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stoyanov, Stoyan","Bailey, Christopher","Desmulliez, Marc P.Y."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":767758,"sim:weight":0.441837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795333,"sim:weight":0.385622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933650,"sim:weight":0.316487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933621,"sim:weight":0.290458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000215,"sim:weight":0.165257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25794,"sim:weight":0.164553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664544,"sim:weight":0.153218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.151978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43096,"sim:weight":0.146329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26022,"sim:weight":0.145003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.1418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933526,"sim:weight":0.134587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.133651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.133651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.133651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.133651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.133651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.133651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.133651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.133651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Whereas the rich biodiversity of endemic southern African fauna has been the focus of many studies, invasive vertebrates are generally overlooked despite potential impacts on biodiversity, health and agriculture. Genetic monitoring of commensal rodents in South Africa which uncovered the presence of Rattus tanezumi, a South-East Asian endemic not previously known to occur in Africa, provided the impetus for expanded studies on all invasive Rattus species present.\r\n\r\nResults: To this end, intensified sampling at 28 South African localities and at one site in Swaziland, identified 149 Rattus specimens. Cytochrome b gene sequencing revealed the presence of two R. tanezumi, seven R. rattus and five R. norvegicus haplotypes in south Africa. Phylogenetic results were consistent with a single, recent R. tanezumi introduction and indicated that R. norvegicus and R. rattus probably became established following at least two and three independent introductions, respectively. Intra- and inter-specific diversity was highest in informal human settlements, with all three species occurring at a single metropolitan township site. Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus each occurred sympatrically with R. tanezumi at one and five sites, respectively. Karyotyping of selected R. rattus and R. tanezumi individuals identified diploid numbers consistent with those reported previously for these cryptic species. Ordination of bioclimatic variables and MaxEnt ecological niche modelling confirmed that the bioclimatic niche occupied by R. tanezumi in south Africa was distinct from that occupied in its naturalised range in south-east Asia suggesting that factors other than climate may influence the distribution of this species.\r\n\r\nConclusions: This study has highlighted the value of genetic typing for detecting cryptic invasive species, providing historical insights into introductions and for directing future sampling. The apparent ease with which a cryptic species can become established signals the need for broader implementation of genetic monitoring programmes. In addition to providing baseline data and potentially identifying high-risk introduction routes, the predictive power of ecological niche modelling is enhanced when species records are genetically verified.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bastos, Armanda D.","Nair, Deenadayalan","Taylor, Peter J.","Brettschneider, Helene","Kirsten, Frikkie","Mostert, Elmarie","von Maltitz, Emil","Lamb, Jennifer M.","van Hooft, Pim","Belmain, Steven R.","Contrafatto, Giancarlo","Downs, Sarah","Chimimba, Christian T."],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":54614,"sim:weight":0.276372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99304,"sim:weight":0.247455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76687,"sim:weight":0.243191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32132,"sim:weight":0.2429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.242879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.242879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66960,"sim:weight":0.230207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.228807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97589,"sim:weight":0.219416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.213069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.209074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.209056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.20821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43383,"sim:weight":0.200979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.189163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777512,"sim:weight":0.186978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85915,"sim:weight":0.185755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.185462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.185032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.184523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study attempts to fill this gap, investigating the apparent natural synergy with brand theory – in that they are both able to captivate and engage consumer-centric sub-cultural groups. Findings indicate that Brands and Hip-Hop weave themselves into the fabrics of society - creating social capital and providing a way for individuals to connect with the world. Through metaphor, slang, symbolism and sampling, they: recycle and preserve aspects of culture; but in doing so, also innovate. Two critical success factors in both appear to be: the ratification of authenticity, and an encouragement towards shared ownership. However in contrast, Hip-Hop places precedence on overt and clear signalling of competitive intent. The methodology used is an Expert Delphi study – which also draws from a review of song lyrics, participant observation studies and in-depth interviews. This provides a basis for inductive reasoning and syllogisms. The aim is two-fold: to present a new Hip-Hop inspired model for brand creation; and secondly to offer an innovative approach to in-depth qualitative studies, using ‘Word Cloud’ software.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilson, Jonathan A.J."],"dc:date":"2011-04-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":312597,"sim:weight":0.619655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99032,"sim:weight":0.450311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108748,"sim:weight":0.273398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47469,"sim:weight":0.247698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98465,"sim:weight":0.206669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.202433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664707,"sim:weight":0.202326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.174521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.174521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.174521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.174521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.174521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.174521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.174521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.174521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.174521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.174521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.174521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.174521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.174521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Halal, as a means for delivering competitive advantage, is considered to be an x-factor - which can help to expand operations, creating new markets and drawing in more consumers.\r\n\r\nIn the shadow of the economic downturn, halal has also been able to increase brand value, relieve constraints associated with barriers to entry, and stabilised fluctuating markets. Muslims, like other ethnic segments, such as the Afro-American Market, are seen to exhibit stronger signs of loyalty trans-nationally, which in some cases have acted as a catalyst to draw in wider non-Muslim communities. From this, it can be argued that halal presents an adaptation of existing management and brand thinking. The interesting phenomenon spearheading this now, is that the concept and nature of halal, warrants verification which is supported by overt branding practices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilson, Jonathan (Bilal) A.

Its status as a new and separate discipline is not solely due to an identified need and demand generated by consumers; but more importantly because existing schools of brand thought and frameworks appear to have gaps, which necessitate investigation and refinement. The purpose of this paper is to address the challenges which the concept of halal presents - when attempting to understand how halal-conscious consumers behave; and what it takes to maintain a credible and authentic brand proposition. The authors assert that halal-conscious consumers are risk-averse, which drives discerning and high-involvement behavioural traits. Furthermore in the face of this, brand managers are still unclear how far they can push more emotionally led brand messages.

This model has then been used in various ways to assess the validity of\r\nRCT and to support as-if arguments in defense of it. This paper makes both historical and methodological contributions. Historically, it investigates how the interpretation of Becker random behavior evolved between the original 1962 article and the modern experimental literature on individual demand, and surveys six experiments in which it has been used as an alternative hypothesis to RCT. Methodologically, this paper conducts an assessment of the as-if defense of RCT from the standpoint of Becker’s model. It argues that this defense is ‘weak’ in a number of senses, and that it has negatively influenced the design of experiments about RCT.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moscati, Ivan","Tubaro, Paola"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":95717,"sim:weight":0.538424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66947,"sim:weight":0.206874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.176913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93305,"sim:weight":0.168927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351913,"sim:weight":0.168291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.165856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.165375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.165375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.165375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.165375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.165375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.165375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.165375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.165375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.165375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.165375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.165375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.165375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.165375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.165375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Data are mainly collected from in-depth semi-structured interviews, and a cause-effect diagram is used to identify and summarize the internal and external risk dimensions of supply chain risk.\r\n\r\nFindings\r\nThis paper identifies both the internal and external supply chain risk from the perspective of the focal manufacturer in the SPV supply chain. At the level of the external supply chain, customer-required design change normally leads to risk in supply, delivery, and policy. Internally for the manufacturer, the risk dimensions are R\u0026D, production, planning, information, and organization. All of\r\nthese risk dimensions have their respective causes.\r\n\r\nResearch limitations/implications\r\nThe risk identification of product design change in this\r\npaper is only meant to lay a foundation; further case studies should focus on the best practices and approaches of risk management and extend them to other industries.\r\n\r\nPractical implications\r\nThe current identification of the risk dimensions and their respective causes will help both practitioners and researchers to better understand supply chain risk in the\r\ncontext of product design change.

It proves to be a fertile ground for many marketers, drawing from Hip-hop orientated language, music, fashion, symbolism and ethea. Notably, Reebok have sponsored rappers as endorsers of their sportswear; HSBC have incorporated Hip-hop terms such as ‘bling’ in their advertising copy; MacDonald’s have paid lyricists to incorporate references to ‘Big Mac’ into their chart songs; and artists such as Banksy have been able to reframe their once frowned upon artistic ‘criminal practices’, towards being seen more as objects of desire. Further to this, mainstream business textbooks, journals and programmes now feature Hip-hop artists; exploring their commercial appeal.\r\n\r\nThis conceptual paper investigates the drivers behind why Hip-hop provides a natural synergy with brand theory, and how Hip-hop and brand architects independently (or perhaps at times collectively) have created similar methods by which they are able to attract and engage with the same audiences. One key factor appears to be the clear signalling of competitive intent within both. Evidence is provided through literature reviews, inductive reasoning and syllogisms - supported by existing empirical data, anecdotal evidence, personal observations and experience; culminating from in-depth interviews with music producers and artists.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to bring a new approach to the creation of brands, rooted in the Hip-hop inspired process of embedding cultural artefacts within popular culture. Through innovative and rich linguistic metaphor, symbolism and sampled music, brands continue to recycle and preserve popular aspects of culture; and in doing so create further wealth.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilson, Jonathan"],"dc:date":"2010-04-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":312597,"sim:weight":0.676475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99032,"sim:weight":0.532979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108748,"sim:weight":0.361485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9425365,"sim:weight":0.347099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102660,"sim:weight":0.188656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89116,"sim:weight":0.186415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23709,"sim:weight":0.184639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43419,"sim:weight":0.173011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.168076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930215,"sim:weight":0.161519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46639,"sim:weight":0.159733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.152629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16761,"sim:weight":0.149407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58751,"sim:weight":0.143731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312663,"sim:weight":0.143345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.138412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.138412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.138412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.138412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.138412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this investigation was to determine the effect of storage in disinfectants\r\nand artificial saliva on a series of commercial soft lining materials for dentures.\r\nChanges in mechanical properties and the nature of chemicals released into these solutions\r\nwere studied.\r\nMethods. Four soft lining materials were studied (Vertex Soft® and Villacryl Soft®, both\r\nof which are plasticized acrylics; Molloplast B® and Mollosil®, both of which are silicone\r\nelastomers). All were cured according to manufacturers’ instructions, and then cylindrical\r\nspecimens (6mm height×10mm diameter) prepared. These were stored under various\r\nconditions then loaded in uniaxial compression and the stress measured at a strain corresponding\r\nto a 10% deformation to determine Young’s modulus. Storage involved exposure\r\neither to the following disinfectants: 2% aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate, 2% aqueous\r\nsodium hypochlorite, Corega Tabs® cleansing tablets or 3% aqueous hydrogen peroxide;\r\nor to artificial saliva. For the latter, storage involved either immersion in artificial saliva at\r\n37 ◦C for the whole study, or immersion for 16h a day and dry at room temperature for the\r\nnext 8h each day. GC/MS was used to determine species leached into these solutions.\r\nResults. The acrylic materials Villacryl Soft and Vertex Soft became less elastic on storage for\r\nup to 28 days whereas the silicone materials Molloplast B and Mollosil, showed no change\r\nin elastic properties. Various compounds were found to be released from these materials,\r\nincluding EGDMA, methyl methacrylate and dibutyl phthalate. Generally, the silicones were\r\nmore stable than acrylics, releasing smaller amounts of the various eluants. In all cases,\r\namounts eluted were well below permitted exposure limits.\r\nSignificance. Practical denture cleansing agents affect the properties of soft lining materials,\r\nreducing their elastomeric character, acrylics being more adversely affected than the\r\nsilicones. These changes are associated with the loss of various chemicals, including plasticizers\r\nand monomers, from the soft lining materials.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brożek, Rafal","Koczorowski, Ryszard","Rogalewicz, Rafal","Voelke, Adam","Czarnecka, Beata","Nicholson, John W."],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1021334,"sim:weight":0.337207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":756324,"sim:weight":0.203694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26749,"sim:weight":0.141979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77307,"sim:weight":0.137513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101462,"sim:weight":0.137469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9837,"sim:weight":0.137169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75634,"sim:weight":0.134676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98474,"sim:weight":0.124196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75609,"sim:weight":0.123364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386814,"sim:weight":0.123342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98541,"sim:weight":0.121675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44827,"sim:weight":0.118413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18164,"sim:weight":0.117937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145874,"sim:weight":0.116102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.115597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1086007,"sim:weight":0.114739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.110217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43821,"sim:weight":0.109303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.107968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102703,"sim:weight":0.104624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

She is currently working on a rewrite of a myth for Canongate’s myth series.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Caroline"],"dc:date":"2007-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45883,"sim:weight":0.594518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761080,"sim:weight":0.551456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17914,"sim:weight":0.542246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710667,"sim:weight":0.526445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381997,"sim:weight":0.522261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101183,"sim:weight":0.519451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.514775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710663,"sim:weight":0.494467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1344239,"sim:weight":0.489801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108440,"sim:weight":0.467436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99217,"sim:weight":0.460382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.451932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.446981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666433,"sim:weight":0.445739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778976,"sim:weight":0.441953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381994,"sim:weight":0.436228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794545,"sim:weight":0.416955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768023,"sim:weight":0.405009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27201,"sim:weight":0.39856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382009,"sim:weight":0.388432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The first reports from this project revealed that against the unfavourable risk factors’ profile observed, only a few men with a previous myocardial infarction were encountered. A follow-up study (SPILI II) was performed twelve years after the initial examination, and the unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile was re-confirmed.\r\nPresentation of the Hypothesis: This paper presents a hypothesis formulated on the basis of previous research to\r\ninvestigate if dynamic psycho-social determinants, including social coherence of the local community, religiosity and spirituality, are protective against the development of coronary heart disease in a well-defined population. Testing the Hypothesis: A follow-up examination of this Cretan cohort is currently being performed to assess the link between psychosocial factors and CVD. Psychosocial factors including sense of control, religiosity and spirituality are assessed in together with conventional CVD risk factors. Smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as dietary habits and activity levels are recorded. Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, as well as ultrasound measurement of carotid intima media thickness, a preclinical marker of atherosclerosis, will also be measured. Implications of the hypothesis tested: The issue of the cardio-protective effect of psycho-social factors would be revisited based on the results of this Cretan cohort; nevertheless, further research is needed across different subpopulations in order to establish a definite relationship. A comprehensive approach based on the aspects of biosocial life may result in more accurate CVD risk management.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lionis, Christos","Anyfantakis, Dimitrios","Symvoulakis, Emannouil K.","Shea, Sue","Panagiotakos, Demosthenes","Castanas, Elias"],"dc:date":"2010-10-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.44278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9995,"sim:weight":0.400416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.390335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.389863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.381464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.36474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.35963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23873,"sim:weight":0.35963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.357189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.357189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.357189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.357189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.357189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.357189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.357189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.357189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.357189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.357189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.357189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.357189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The first case study examines the anti-privatisation campaign in El Salvador in 2002-3, which drew on support from other trade union and civil society organisations as well as established transnational solidarity networks. The second case study looks at the joint COSASTU and Treatment Action Campaign in South Africa, which is campaigning for improved access to treatment for people with HIV/AIDS. This campaign also draws support from transnational networks.\r\n\r\nThe concepts of ‘social movement unionism’ and ‘new labour internationalism’ may not provide the answer for future trade union strategies. The range of alliances and partnerships that trade unions are making, in their actions to fight neo-liberalism, do not fit securely into one model but, rather, give some insights into the ‘movement’ elements of trade unionism. These activities may sometimes create tension with collective bargaining and other institutional processes.  \r\n\r\nThis has implications for trade unions and civil society organisations involved in transnational networks.

Innovative tourism businesses, often in the small business sector, are likely to be more beneficial to the local community in terms of job creation and economic linkages. Such forms of tourism could offer new forms of livelihood in destination communities, making tourism an effective strategy for livelihood diversification that is more sustainable and community-based. Community-based tourism initiatives can also help form community networks that facilitate involvement of local stakeholders in a more efficient manner. This paper analyses the role of entrepreneurial innovation in facilitating community networks and sustainable livelihoods in tourism. A case study of an eco-heritage tourism resort of Coconut Palms, in the Indian state of Kerala provides an illustration of how entrepreneurial innovation helped form a community network and offer sustainable livelihood diversification opportunities to stakeholders in the periphery of tourism. The paper, thus, contributes an example of a sustainable community-private network and a new understanding into a phenomenon that has potential to make a real contribution to the lives of persons in disadvantaged communities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kokkranikal, Jithendran","Morrison, Alison"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101516,"sim:weight":0.608368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101270,"sim:weight":0.596093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1028306,"sim:weight":0.574182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":928880,"sim:weight":0.538956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.516625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":845740,"sim:weight":0.504602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652783,"sim:weight":0.500091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664716,"sim:weight":0.48953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101372,"sim:weight":0.351631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103312,"sim:weight":0.333552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43479,"sim:weight":0.259971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108827,"sim:weight":0.257547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5669,"sim:weight":0.243664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5559,"sim:weight":0.23125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767491,"sim:weight":0.222679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5629,"sim:weight":0.219627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.204828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632272,"sim:weight":0.195168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67104,"sim:weight":0.183378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15016,"sim:weight":0.178326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The DSC operates in the presence of uncertainty in customer demands. The demands are described by imprecise linguistic expressions that are modelled by discrete fuzzy sets. Inventories at each facility within the DSC are replenished by applying periodic review policies with optimal order up-to-quantities. Fuzzy customer demands imply fuzziness in inventory positions at the end of review intervals and in incurred relevant costs per unit time interval. The determination of the minimum of defuzzified total cost of the DSC is a complex problem which is solved by applying decomposition; the original problem is decomposed into a number of simpler independent optimisation subproblems, where each retailer and the warehouse determine their optimum periodic reviews and order up-to-quantities. An iterative coordination mechanism is proposed for changing the review periods and order up-to-quantities for each retailer and the warehouse in such a way that all parties within the DSC are satisfied with respect to total incurred costs per unit time interval. Coordination is performed by introducing fuzzy constraints on review periods and fuzzy tolerances on retailers and warehouse costs in local optimisation subproblems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Petrovic, Dobrila","Xie, Ying","Burnham, Keith","Petrovic, Radivoj"],"dc:date":"2008-02-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1381943,"sim:weight":0.425561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1019038,"sim:weight":0.404288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":842901,"sim:weight":0.392065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1041908,"sim:weight":0.357701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":980865,"sim:weight":0.336417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1083559,"sim:weight":0.31735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":840170,"sim:weight":0.315519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":926136,"sim:weight":0.308295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1117316,"sim:weight":0.307702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":766249,"sim:weight":0.297131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383507,"sim:weight":0.29276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":926131,"sim:weight":0.292648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":926129,"sim:weight":0.274747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":971963,"sim:weight":0.251786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":729105,"sim:weight":0.24889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99184,"sim:weight":0.236852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652986,"sim:weight":0.23419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382471,"sim:weight":0.231937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":766365,"sim:weight":0.231661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":759235,"sim:weight":0.222922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The promises of qualitatively-informed agent-based modeling","bibo:abstract":"Mixed-method models are increasingly adopted in the social sciences (Lincoln, 2010). In this paper, we take a methodological stance by discussing the benefits of combining qualitative research (in-depth interviews, participant observations and case studies) with agent-based computer simulation in order to analyse social networks, in cases in which detailed micro-behavioural information is required and/or with hidden and sensitive populations.\r\nThe paper is part of a larger research project on the recent rise of a highly controversial Internet movement advocating anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (“pro-ana” and “pro-mia”, in web jargon), in the form of websites, blogs and forums. In an effort to gain insight into the social determinants of this subculture, their implications for the health and nutrition of participants, and possible policy responses, we are conducting a comprehensive comparison of the online and offline personal networks of individuals with eating disorders.\r\nThe data in which we are interested allows limited use of quantitative methods. Large-scale surveys, longitudinal studies, or even mapping of complete networks can hardly be conducted with a relatively small, partly hidden, and very vulnerable population. To overcome these constraints, we have devised a general analytical framework relying heavily on qualitative research carried out on a smaller, purposive (i.e. not statistically representative) sample of subjects. The method consists of using this type of empirical data to inform agent-based computer simulation (Tubaro \u0026 Casilli, 2010). While qualitative analysis and models have often been considered as mutually exclusive, we claim that bringing together their respective strengths can contribute to a better understanding of social phenomena that would be difficult to study otherwise - notably the pro ana-mia lifestyle and computer mediated communication in the related “cloaked” websites (Daniels, 2009).\r\nIn particular, we illustrate how qualitative research can provide present-day agent-based models with a sound and proper insight as to the behaviour and motivations of social actors –an insight that quantitative data do not always provide, at least at micro level and for hidden and sensitive populations. Conversely, agent-based modelling and simulation offer valuable tools for: a) performing “thought experiments” to check the consistency of social scientists’ theoretical frameworks and to precisely define their domains of applicability; b) replicating and generalizing findings; c) providing a basis for cross-disciplinary validation of results.\r\nWe detail the epistemic and methodological structure that allows articulation between qualitative analysis and agent-based modelling to occur, insisting on the possibility for qualitative data to intervene at different stages of the modelling process and on the need for a two-way feedback, from data to model and from model to data.\r\nFinally, we conclude with a discussion of potential challenges, both in relation to our particular research project (with its twofold online/offline perspective and its specific target population) and from a more general methodological viewpoint","bibo:AuthorList":["Tubaro, Paola","Casilli, Antonio A."],"dc:date":"2010-04-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":66949,"sim:weight":0.455564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23259,"sim:weight":0.320531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.305013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.295804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.295754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.281546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.277698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145949,"sim:weight":0.272143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.268705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.268705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.268705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.268705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.268705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.268705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.268705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.268705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.268705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.268705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.268705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.268705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Strongly upregulated genes included those involved in redox activity, mitochondrial functions, the response to oxidative stress, and cytoplasmic rRNA transcription and processing. Highly repressed genes have roles in mitochondrial biogenesis, and the expression and stability of cytoplasmic rRNAs. T-2 toxin inhibition of growth was greater in a medium requiring respiration, and was antagonized by antioxidants. T-2 toxin treatment induced reactive oxygen species, caused nucleolytic damage to DNA, probably mitochondrial, and externalization of phosphatidylserine. Deletion mutations causing respiratory deficiency substantially increased toxin tolerance, and deletion of some TOR (target of rapamycin) pathway genes altered T-2 toxin sensitivity. Deletion of FMS1, which plays an indirect role in cytoplasmic protein synthesis, markedly increased toxin tolerance. Overall, the findings suggest that T-2 toxin targets mitochondria, generating oxy-radicals and repressing mitochondrial biogenesis genes, thus inducing oxidative stress and redox enzyme genes, and triggering changes associated with apoptosis. The large transcriptional changes in genes needed for rRNA transcription and expression and the effects of deletion of FMS1 are also consistent with T-2 toxin damage to the cytoplasmic translational mechanism, although it is unclear how this relates to the mitochondrial effects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jossé, Lyne","Li , Xingmin","Coker, Raymond D.","Gourlay, Campbell W.","Evans, Ivor H."],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":898468,"sim:weight":0.317035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":901493,"sim:weight":0.248364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":743816,"sim:weight":0.17413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2730917,"sim:weight":0.152471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48455,"sim:weight":0.146419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709963,"sim:weight":0.144168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709980,"sim:weight":0.141385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85343,"sim:weight":0.13782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107415,"sim:weight":0.135125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108070,"sim:weight":0.133911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1001426,"sim:weight":0.132684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49697,"sim:weight":0.130678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.127337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":951464,"sim:weight":0.125876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8754,"sim:weight":0.122241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101347,"sim:weight":0.11968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107063,"sim:weight":0.118988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77174,"sim:weight":0.117544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146005,"sim:weight":0.1169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710568,"sim:weight":0.11636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The successful experience of some of these agglomerations of firms both in developed and developing countries shows that the potential existence of external economies and joint actions can indeed facilitate a process of sustainable growth. The aim of this paper is to create a bridge between Frances’ Stewart concern about appropriate technology and the literature on clusters in developing countries. In this paper we review the academic debate on technology and technological change in developing countries which Frances’ significantly contributed to originate, focusing our attention on the link between technological issues, clusters and their role in poverty reduction, in an attempt of reconciling apparently distant branches of the literature, developed in different decades.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pietrobelli, Carlo","Rabellotti , Roberta","Gorgoni, Sara"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":81447,"sim:weight":0.325163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":778833,"sim:weight":0.286056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45557,"sim:weight":0.268478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2792197,"sim:weight":0.266942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710137,"sim:weight":0.263702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710118,"sim:weight":0.245931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709962,"sim:weight":0.230881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269919,"sim:weight":0.230872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710082,"sim:weight":0.222779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.209014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.202992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.202992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.202992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.202992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.202992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.202992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.202992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.202992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.202992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.202992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Its protected areas, La Sepultura, La Frailescana, El Triunfo, Pico de Loro El Paxtal and Volcán Tacaná provide water for several municipalities and are important tourist attractions. Much of the forest cover outside the core protected areas is in fact coffee grown under traditional forest shade. Unless this (agro)forest cover can be sustained, the biodiversity of the Sierra Madre and the environmental services it provides are at risk. Threats include the increasing population, poverty, the risk of land use change driven by unstable coffee markets, and climate change. We analyzed the threats to livelihoods and environment from climate change through crop suitability modeling based on downscaled climate scenarios for 2050, an expert workshop and literature review. Significant areas of forest and occasionally coffee are destroyed every year by wildfires, and this problem is bound to increase in a hotter and drier future climate. Widespread landslides and inundations, including on coffee farms, have recently been caused by hurricanes whose intensity, by some accounts, is predicted to increase. A hotter climate with more irregular rainfall will be less favorable to the production of quality coffee and lower profitability may compel farmers to abandon shade coffee and expand other land uses of less biodiversity value, probably at the expense of forest. A comprehensive strategy to sustain the biodiversity, ecosystem services and livelihoods of the Sierra Madre in the face of climate change should include the promotion of biodiversity friendly coffee growing and processing practices including complex shade which can offer some hurricane protection and product diversification; payments for forest conservation and restoration from existing government programs complemented by private initiatives; diversification of income sources to mitigate risks associated with unstable environmental conditions and coffee markets; integrated fire management; development of markets that reward sustainable land use practices and forest conservation; crop insurance programs that are accessible to smallholders; and the strengthening of local capacity for adaptive resource management.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schroth, Goetz","Laderach, Peter","Dempewolf, Jan","Philpott, Stacy","Haggar, Jeremy","Eakin, Hallie","Castillejos, Teresa","Garcia Moreno, Jaime","Soto Pinto, Lorena","Hernandez, Ricardo","Eitzinger, Anton","Ramirez Villegas, Julian"],"dc:date":"2009-10-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2794271,"sim:weight":0.41415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97653,"sim:weight":0.376707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97600,"sim:weight":0.354884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382177,"sim:weight":0.331155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316337,"sim:weight":0.323884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58415,"sim:weight":0.322065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58019,"sim:weight":0.309085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":567988,"sim:weight":0.29556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.288931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58045,"sim:weight":0.27063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.27047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.27047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382175,"sim:weight":0.267393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96394,"sim:weight":0.265023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777903,"sim:weight":0.24178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":567992,"sim:weight":0.239037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43479,"sim:weight":0.237732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58007,"sim:weight":0.231876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93660,"sim:weight":0.231578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.228292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

MCV is similar to simian virus 40 (SV40) and encodes a nuclear large T (LT) oncoprotein that is usually mutated to eliminate viral replication among tumor-derived MCV. We identified the hVam6p cytoplasmic protein involved in lysosomal processing as a novel interactor with MCV LT but not SV40 LT. hVam6p binds through its clathrin heavy chain homology domain to a unique region of MCV LT adjacent to the retinoblastoma binding site. MCV LT translocates hVam6p to the nucleus, sequestering it from involvement in lysosomal trafficking. A naturally occurring, tumor-derived mutant LT (MCV350) lacking a nuclear localization signal binds hVam6p but fails to inhibit hVam6p-induced lysosomal clustering. MCV has evolved a novel mechanism to target hVam6p that may contribute to viral uncoating or egress through lysosomal processing during virus replication","bibo:AuthorList":["Liu, Xi","Hein, Jennifer","Richardson, Simon C.W.","Basse, Per H.","Toptan, Tuna","Moore, Patrick S.","Gjoerup, Ole V.","Chang, Yuan"],"dc:date":"2011-05-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19084,"sim:weight":0.125264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103076,"sim:weight":0.113189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49071,"sim:weight":0.106832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19283,"sim:weight":0.0912798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10941,"sim:weight":0.0871594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46540,"sim:weight":0.0862185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584827,"sim:weight":0.0861725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779642,"sim:weight":0.0853589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631656,"sim:weight":0.0830103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":917479,"sim:weight":0.0816071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.0807527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709980,"sim:weight":0.0796491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.0789391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145826,"sim:weight":0.0789158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998673,"sim:weight":0.0786837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384092,"sim:weight":0.0778516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77916,"sim:weight":0.0775636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43841,"sim:weight":0.0759585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631653,"sim:weight":0.0739163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393674,"sim:weight":0.071888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using the Jericho Forums Cloud Cube Model (CCM), we classify cloud computing business models into eight types: (1) Service Provider and Service Orientation; (2) Support and Services Contracts; (3) In-House Private Clouds; (4) All-In-One Enterprise Cloud; (5) One-Stop Resources and Services; (6) Government Funding; (7) Venture Capitals; and (8) Entertainment and Social Networking. In addition, we newly propose the Hexagon Model that includes six key elements for sustainability based on Sun Tzus Art of War and literature review, and the sixth factor is rated based on case studies and peer reviews. Areas occupied in the Hexagon can represent strengths and weaknesses of a cloud business, and several cases are presented with rationale explained. We present four cases with Hexagon models, which include Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and an anonymous UK NHS and an University. Apart from the qualitative approach, the quantitative approach we use is the Capital Asset Pricing (CAPM), which aim organisational sustainability and predicts how well firms perform. The OMII-UK data is used to demonstrate sustainability and study the impact on cloud businesses, and is presented by statistical computation, 3D visualisation and the Hexagon Model. This leads to development of Cloud Sustainability Framework (CSF), which measures cloud business performance. CSF is part of the Cloud Computing Business Framework (CCBF), which will be discussed in some extent. We believe that adopting an appropriate cloud computing business model will help organisations investing in this technology to stand firm at all times.

It covers the operational and strategic consequences of an improving logistical service, but also enables significant judgements to be made on the 18th century state, its performance under pressure of war, the public-private relationship, and the links between supply and diplomacy.\r\n\r\nThe transportation of provisions to the Baltic posed serious problems for naval administrators, politicians, and admirals alike.  This thesis shows that in practice, naval supply was conducted very effectively; operations in the Baltic were not harmed for want of provisions. The state used the resources of the private sector, particularly the market for shipping, to serve its interests.  In the Baltic itself, means were found to secure provisions locally, even from countries in conflict with Britain.  Sweden – forced into an unwanted war with Britain by Napoleon – was happy to supply the British though it required much discretion and diplomatic intrigue to avoid the ears of the French spies.\r\n\r\nWide scale governmental reform, particularly the Commission for Naval Revision which reported from 1809, brought enhanced timeliness and efficiency to the victualling service.  By 1810 a fleet lying in the Baltic was as well supplied as one lying off Deptford, significantly widening operational capabilities.  The successful British blockade in the Baltic could not have been achieved twenty years earlier.  It is argued that administrative developments created a strategic watershed, after which naval power could be more fully mobilised than ever before.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davey, James"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":96444,"sim:weight":0.240958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76822,"sim:weight":0.235685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45098,"sim:weight":0.219332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48242,"sim:weight":0.211922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86125,"sim:weight":0.208494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.194561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929879,"sim:weight":0.193731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381996,"sim:weight":0.19338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.191694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145753,"sim:weight":0.183023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108636,"sim:weight":0.182046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76628,"sim:weight":0.181946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.179091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29418,"sim:weight":0.175057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98920,"sim:weight":0.172651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108350,"sim:weight":0.168893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45534,"sim:weight":0.168243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46875,"sim:weight":0.168071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.164898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.164898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aims of this study were to (i) identify ways in which young people conceptualise their identities with regard to \u0027race\u0027, gender and religion and (ii) consider young people\u0027s constructions of racism and sexism, particularly within the context of school.\r\n\r\nAnalyses suggest that the young men constructed \u0027Muslim\u0027 identities, through which they positioned themselves as \u0027not western\u0027, and asserted hegemonic masculinities. These constructions are contrasted with previous literature, in which second generation Asians are conceptualised as choosing between \u0027British\u0027 and \u0027Asian\u0027 identities. The young men used discourses of \u0027culture\u0027 to position themselves both as \u0027not proper Muslims\u0027 (in comparison to Muslims in Bangladesh) and as \u0027authentic\u0027 Muslims (in comparison to Muslim women in Britain). These constructions are discussed in terms of the young men\u0027s talk about the duties of \u0027being a man\u0027.\r\n\r\nAnalyses of the female discussion group data suggest that the young women reproduced and resisted stereotypical discourses of themselves as oppressed, \u0027passive victims\u0027. In particular, young women conceptualised arranged marriages in terms of \u0027choice\u0027, positioning forced marriages as \u0027not marriage\u0027. The theme of choice is also reproduced in discussions around the wearing of dbuttah and educational careers, in which the young women emphasised their own agency. In comparison to the young men, the women constructed \u0027British Muslim\u0027 identities. The differences in the young people\u0027s identity constructions are discussed in terms of their resistance to racist discourses and the negotiation of masculinities and femininities. Similarities in the young people\u0027s use of \u0027race\u0027 discourses are also highlighted, through their construction \u0027Black\u0027 and \u0027Asian\u0027 identities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Archer, Louise"],"dc:date":"1998-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43663,"sim:weight":0.398339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57213,"sim:weight":0.35826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383641,"sim:weight":0.354277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.353845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98927,"sim:weight":0.34571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108332,"sim:weight":0.342729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48328,"sim:weight":0.328439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.316647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145947,"sim:weight":0.316368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383660,"sim:weight":0.31596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381933,"sim:weight":0.313543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54179,"sim:weight":0.312613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.312147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.309811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.304846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44868,"sim:weight":0.296616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381999,"sim:weight":0.285438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99228,"sim:weight":0.284283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146054,"sim:weight":0.275337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43649,"sim:weight":0.272011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It considers these partnerships involvement in, and attitudes toward, the campaigns for women\u0027 s enfranchisement over a fifty year period from 1880 - 1930. The aim of this study is to contribute to our understanding of the gendered nature of political activity and identity through an examination of the women\u0027 s suffrage campaigns, in particular the still under-researched, yet extremely important question of men\u0027s support for women\u0027 s suffrage. This thesis takes as its point of departure historical studies of gender,\r\nthat is, a critical examination of the constructions of masculinity and femininity; ideas which have been informed and developed by women\u0027s history. It will consider the extent to which developments within the suffrage movement both challenged and reinforced gendered political identities and influenced attitudes toward the parts that men and women had to play in both the public and private\r\nspheres. The partnerships studied demonstrate not only the diversity of opinion within the women\u0027s suffrage movement but also how this single issue affected familial politics at a variety of levels. Each chapter focuses on one political partnership and charts its involvement - whatever form it took - during one of the most dynamic periods in modern British history. The partnerships included in this\r\nthesis are diverse and are comprised of Emmeline and Richard Pankhurst, James and Marion Bryce, John and Katharine Bruce Glasier, Emmeline and Frederick Pethick-Li1wrence, Annot and Sam Robinson, and Elsie Duval and Hugh Franklin. This thesis is, therefore, a contribution to both suffrage history and to the study of political partnerships in relation to changes in British political culture during a period of intense debates about the symbolic and actual\r\nrepresentation of women.","bibo:AuthorList":["Balshaw, June Marion"],"dc:date":"1998-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108695,"sim:weight":0.670744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316073,"sim:weight":0.645626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316097,"sim:weight":0.63105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383584,"sim:weight":0.59769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108999,"sim:weight":0.574226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108988,"sim:weight":0.559854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82889,"sim:weight":0.542722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316067,"sim:weight":0.528582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382011,"sim:weight":0.527302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352200,"sim:weight":0.517293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316123,"sim:weight":0.507251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13239,"sim:weight":0.506268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8766807,"sim:weight":0.502132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383850,"sim:weight":0.500604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.499209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45867,"sim:weight":0.497665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381986,"sim:weight":0.495191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112506,"sim:weight":0.495123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47177,"sim:weight":0.494552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43950,"sim:weight":0.489671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For this paper, a sample of British seaside towns that form part of the newly approved Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) are analysed to identify how these new governance arrangements are likely to affect future development in these areas.  Core-periphery theory (CPT) is used as a framework within which to analyse these arrangements and to identify potential problems and obstacles.  Analysis reveals significant governance issues for seaside towns in terms of structural inequalities and relationships of dependency.  The LEPs do not adequately recognise the peripheral nature of seaside towns and the special conditions needed for their development.  There is a reliance on outdated growth models and there is a lack of innovation in their approach.  From a CPT perspective, the new LEPs do not seem to provide a brighter future for the development of seaside towns.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kennell, James","Chaperon, Samantha","Gale, Tim","McCabe, Scott"],"dc:date":"2011-04-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101253,"sim:weight":0.477372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.158799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101658,"sim:weight":0.146109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10761,"sim:weight":0.145367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76011,"sim:weight":0.142499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.141167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.140968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46821,"sim:weight":0.140548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.138184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632272,"sim:weight":0.135375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101516,"sim:weight":0.134178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.133757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.133757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.133757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.133757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.133757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.133757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.133757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.133757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.133757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Throughout the developing world, micronutrient deficiency is one of the most important factors influencing human health, being directly responsible for conditions such as xeropthalmia, associated with vitamin A deficiency and anaemia, due to iron deficiency.  In addition, micronutrient deficiency predisposes children to infection and retards recovery from common infections such as malaria, measles and diarrhoea.  The groups most at risk from micronutrient deficiency are usually children and those for whom labour for food production is limited by ill health (HIV sufferers), advanced age or intense social commitments (single mothers, for example).  There have been numerous health projects in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere in the developing world, to address micronutrient deficiency through the distribution of vitamin and mineral supplements, which usually have to be imported.  An alternative (or complementary) approach is to promote the inclusion of high quality food crops in the farming system to enrich the diet with essential vitamins and minerals. This  agricultural approach to the problem of micronutrient deficiency can provide sustainable solutions, which improve diet quality.  An increase in the cultivation of high quality foods such as legumes, fruits and green vegetables, may be able to deliver a balanced diet to households, without necessarily requiring additional land and labour. Agricultural approaches to enhance dietary intake of vitamins and minerals have the additional advantage that they foster community self-reliance, they are sustainable in the absence of external funding, and, offer the opportunity for enhanced income by marketing surplus production.  Diet diversification through better use of existing biodiversity offers an immediate means to address poor diet quality and can also include the use of presently available nutritionally enhanced crops, such as orange-fleshed sweet potato.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hillocks, R.J."],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1041782,"sim:weight":0.332835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795331,"sim:weight":0.279121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24544,"sim:weight":0.273875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2792595,"sim:weight":0.263761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709524,"sim:weight":0.260813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":361129,"sim:weight":0.259365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.259165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.259165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22729,"sim:weight":0.249173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81978,"sim:weight":0.248933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102676,"sim:weight":0.245096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108833,"sim:weight":0.243406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767492,"sim:weight":0.240858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22728,"sim:weight":0.226423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81882,"sim:weight":0.213131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94912,"sim:weight":0.213126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43479,"sim:weight":0.20809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.207589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316337,"sim:weight":0.207123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.204853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To obtain a better understanding of the genetic diversity among SPCSVEA isolates, the major coat protein (CP) and heat shock protein 70 homologue (Hsp70h) gene sequences of 24 further isolates of SPCSVEA were determined and compared. SPCSVEA diversity was also examined using available monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to SPCSVEA but there was no apparent coincidence between CP and partial Hsp70h gene nucleotide sequences and the subdivision of SPCSVEA isolates by the mAbs into two serotypes, suggesting this latter may not be of great biological significance. The nucleotide (nt) sequences of isolates of SPCSVEA displayed a high degree of conservation and the only variation observed consisted of a few base exchanges.

The catch of An. arabiensis in human-baited traps\r\n(HBT) was 25 times greater than in cattle-baited traps (CBT) (34.0 vs. 1.3, n \u003d 24; P \u003c 0.001) whereas, for An.\r\npharoensis there was no significant difference. Furthermore, HBT and CBT catches were unaffected by a ring of\r\ncattle (4 × 4 Latin square comparison) for either An. arabiensis (n \u003d 48; P \u003e 0.999) or An. pharoensis (n \u003d 48, P \u003e 0.870). The HLC catches indoors vs. outdoors were not significantly different for either An. arabiensis or An.\r\npharoensis (n \u003d 12, P \u003e 0.969), but for An. arabiensis only, the indoor catch was reduced significantly by 49% when\r\nthe hut was surrounded by cattle (Tukey HSD, n \u003d 12, P \u003e 0.01).\r\nConclusions: Outdoors, a preponderance of cattle (20:1, cattle:humans) does not provide any material\r\nzooprophylactic effect against biting by An. arabiensis. For a human indoors, the presence of cattle outdoors nearly\r\nhalved the catch. Unfortunately, this level of reduction would not have an appreciable impact on malaria incidence\r\nin an area with typically \u003e 1 infective bite/person/night. For An. pharoensis, cattle significantly reduced the human\r\ncatch indoors and outdoors, but still only by about half. These results suggest that even for traditional pastoralist\r\ncommunities of East Africa, the presence of large numbers of cattle does not confer effective zooprophylaxis\r\nagainst malaria transmitted by An. arabiensis or An. pharoensis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tirados, Iñaki","Gibson, Gabriella","Young, Stephen","Torr, Stephen J."],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":105116,"sim:weight":0.331637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1644010,"sim:weight":0.318294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85646,"sim:weight":0.318213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710038,"sim:weight":0.237644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.215439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.215204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.20976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.20156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.199677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.19098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.184084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.184084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.184084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.184084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.184084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.184084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.184084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.184084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.184084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.184084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Responses were measured either by baiting (1.) biconical traps or (2.) electrocuting black targets with natural host odours. The catch of G. tachinoides from traps was significantly enhanced (~5×) by odour from cattle but not humans. In contrast, catches from electric targets showed inconsistent results. For G. p. gambiensis both human and cattle odour increased (\u003e2×) the trap catch significantly but not the catch from electric targets. For G. p. palpalis, odours from pigs and humans increased (~5×) the numbers of tsetse attracted to the vicinity of the odour source but had little effect on landing or trap-entry. For G. tachinoides a blend of POCA (P \u003d 3-n-propylphenol; O \u003d 1-octen-3-ol; C \u003d 4-methylphenol; A \u003d acetone) alone or synthetic cattle odour (acetone, 1-octen-3-ol, 4-methylphenol and 3-n-propylphenol with carbon dioxide) consistently caught more tsetse than natural cattle odour. For G. p. gambiensis, POCA consistently increased catches from both traps and targets. For G. p. palpalis, doses of carbon dioxide similar to those produced by a host resulted in similar increases in attraction. Baiting traps with super-normal (~500 mg/h) doses of acetone also consistently produced significant but slight (~1.6×) increases in catches of male flies. The results suggest that odour-baited traps and insecticide-treated targets could assist the AU-Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) in its current efforts to monitor and control Palpalis group tsetse in West Africa. For all three species, only ~50% of the flies attracted to the vicinity of the trap were actually caught by it, suggesting that better traps might be developed by an analysis of the visual responses and identification of any semiochemicals involved in short-range interaction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rayaisse, J.B.","Tirados, I.","Kaba, D.","Dewhirst, S.Y.","Logan, J.G.","Diarrassouba, A.","Salou, E.","Omolo, M.O.","Solano, P.","Lehane, M.J.","Pickett, J.A.","Vale, G.A.","Torr, S.J..","Esterhuizen, J."],"dc:date":"2010-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316339,"sim:weight":0.64129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316333,"sim:weight":0.639498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316332,"sim:weight":0.616963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316338,"sim:weight":0.495035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":685955,"sim:weight":0.467894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316581,"sim:weight":0.421725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316331,"sim:weight":0.285348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.225845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.213177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.213177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.200099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.19886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.198853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.198666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665477,"sim:weight":0.195208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.189543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643700,"sim:weight":0.18838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.184814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.184015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.183568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For all tsetse, odours play a role in host location but the relative importance of olfactory stimuli varies between species.  For Morsitans-group tsetse such as Glossina pallidipes and G. m. morsitans, host odours elicit longrange (~100 m) orientation whereas Palpalis group species such as G. palpalis spp. And G. fuscipes spp. while showing significant olfactory responses, are much less responsive.  Hence baiting traps with natural host odours can increase the catch of some Morsitans tsetse ten-fold compared to only a doubling with Palpalis tsetse.  Species that are less sensitive to odours seem to be more responsive to visual stimuli.  The semiochemicals present in host odours include carbon dioxide, 1-octen-3-ol, acetone, butanone, 4-methylphenol and 3-n-propylphenol.  For Morsitans tsetse, odours from hosts are not, in general, significantly different from those of non-hosts and thus olfaction does not seem to play an important role in host selection.  The notable exception to this is human odour which is repellent to some species of Morsitans tsetse.  Traps and insecticide-treated targets baited with blend of 1-octenol-3-ol, ketones and phenols are, arguably, the most successful application of artificial baits to vector control worldwide.  The current use and future prospects of using natural and artificial baits to control tsetse are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Torr, Steve J.","Solano, Philippe","Takken, Willem","Knols, Bart G.J."],"dc:date":"2010-04-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316045,"sim:weight":0.629966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316332,"sim:weight":0.612372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316339,"sim:weight":0.509717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316376,"sim:weight":0.49076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316333,"sim:weight":0.422557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316338,"sim:weight":0.400714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316581,"sim:weight":0.363972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":617746,"sim:weight":0.237842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316331,"sim:weight":0.234012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91311,"sim:weight":0.161181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45359,"sim:weight":0.135553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386243,"sim:weight":0.117509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45314,"sim:weight":0.115331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316044,"sim:weight":0.115005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99417,"sim:weight":0.106108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46552,"sim:weight":0.0908559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.09021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.0859305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44827,"sim:weight":0.0816069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85054,"sim:weight":0.0798225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Comparative multidisciplinary studies of the belief systems and use of four freshwater lakes, one sacred and one non-sacred, in each of two communities, Biseni and Osiama in Bayelsa State, were conducted.  A combination of in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, participant observation, structured questionnaires and ecological field surveys, was used. Assessment of fish biodiversity in the four lakes was conducted in conjunction with local fishermen.\r\n\r\nResults revealed a structured system of beliefs, rules and meanings within these communities which influence the communities’ use of natural resources and ensure the protection of certain reptiles, such as the threatened dwarf crocodile, Osteolaemus tetraspis.  There are social sanctions and penalties for contravening the rules.  Common ancestry and social connectedness among neighbouring communities link the management of some of these lakes together, forming a network of lakes reserved for periodic fishing.  Measurements of fish biodiversity showed that the sacred lakes had higher diversities, as measured by both the Shannon-Weiner and Simpson-Yule indices, than the non-sacred lakes.  Characiformes and Siluriformes were the predominant orders confirming observations made by fisherfolk within the study group.\r\n\r\nThe culturally protected freshwater lakes studied provide insights into how biodiversity loss in the Niger Delta can be tackled through the involvement of indigenous people in the management of threatened biodiversity and watershed areas.

It takes as its starting point Sergius Stepniak\u0027s comments on the impact of a small group of socialists on a Liberal- Radical demonstration in Hyde Park in 1884, and closes with the formation of the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1920 and the refusal to allow Th. Rothstein re-entry into Britain in August 1920. \r\n\r\nIt takes issue with those historians who have argued that the Russian political emigré influence was essentially harmful, serving only to undermine natural developments already in evidence on the British Left and imposing new perspectives, which later made the CPGB subservient to the needs of Soviet foreign policy. This thesis, on the contrary, argues that the Russian political emigré community in Britain, predominantly Jewish, had become an integral part of the Left-wing of the British labour movement by the time of the formation of the CPGB, and as such formed part of the British socialist tradition that favoured Marxism.\r\n\r\nIt looks specifically at the history of the Social-Democratic Federation, (SDF) which between 1884 and 1920 adopted the titles Social-Democratic Party and British Socialist Party before it merged itself with the CPGB in 1920. The SDF appealed particularly to the Russian political emigrés, as opposed to other groupings, because it saw itself as a Social-Democratic body and part of an international movement, to which the Russian Social- Democratic Labour Party was affiliated. The emigrés, therefore, felt that their activity within the British socialist movement was not something imposed upon a reluctant nativist body; but an integral part of that movement\u0027s development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burke, David"],"dc:date":"1997-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":56356,"sim:weight":0.75305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731545,"sim:weight":0.682094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381998,"sim:weight":0.677758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75513,"sim:weight":0.657604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382035,"sim:weight":0.653352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99294,"sim:weight":0.636155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381993,"sim:weight":0.632192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631094,"sim:weight":0.616242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108398,"sim:weight":0.598658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.598096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75498,"sim:weight":0.596559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44884,"sim:weight":0.584933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101251,"sim:weight":0.584674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382064,"sim:weight":0.57839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75496,"sim:weight":0.576113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108765,"sim:weight":0.573115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59086,"sim:weight":0.571585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382091,"sim:weight":0.57044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77430,"sim:weight":0.568641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382074,"sim:weight":0.564605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The modelling work conducted is in context of solidification for casting processes.\r\n\r\nThe control volume-unstructured mesh (CV-UM) method can be categorised into two approaches, a vertex-centred and a cell-centred approach. The classification of the approach is based on the relationship between the control volume and the unstructured mesh. The vertex-centred is naturally unstructured and has been used successfully in fluid flow and heat transfer calculations. The cell-centred on the other hand has always been associated with structured (quadrilateral) meshes, this has been extended to handle\r\nunstructured mesh in the current work and is called the irregular control volume (ICV) method. Both approaches have been studied for solidification by conduction only, using\r\nseveral standard phase change test cases and one with experimental data from the casting industry. The result of this work is reported and their suitability for solidification addressed. \r\n\r\nFor the ICV method, the extension to solve the full convective-diffusive solidification was undertaken, these are primarily the fluid flow and energy equations solved using the well known SIMPLE algorithm. One spin-off from the ICV is the appearance of \"highorder cell\" control volumes, control volumes with more than the standard four cell faces in two-dimensions. The high-order cell technique is exhibiting the same characteristics as high-order schemes used in standard CV method, when applied to standard CFD test cases. The one current drawback for the technique is the generation of these high-ordercells, currently no fully- or semi-automatic mesh generation is available. This prevented further study of the technique and used in the solidification test cases, where in one, experimental data is available for the phase change fronts. This was carried Out using quadrilateral meshes, but solved using the unstructured approach of the ICV. The predicted solution is in qualitative agreement with experiment.\r\n\r\nThe second convective-diffusive solidification problem is the first to demonstrate the CV-UM integrated framework by solving two major casting components simultaneously,\r\nthe solidification (the work undertaken in this research) and the residual stress for deformation. This is still an on going research work, where refinement and validation\r\nare required and further integration of casting processes, such as mould filling, are necessary to complete the various stages of the shape casting process.\r\n\r\nThis kind of integrated simulation requires huge amount of computations, it will take days for traditional scalar computers to do one prediction.

During the last ten years an increasing amount of activity has taken place in this area. Unlike the finite element formulation, which generally involves volume integrals, the finite volume formulation transfers volume integrals to surface integrals using the divergence theorem.\r\nThis transformation for convection and diffusion terms in the governing equations, ensures conservation at the local element level. This is seen as a major attraction for finite volume methods. \r\n\r\nThe research presented in this thesis details the development of a cell vertex based finite volume formulation for complex analysis like geometrically nonlinear modelling and plate analysis. For both geometrically nonlinear and plate analysis a series of simulation results are presented and are compared with conventional finite element results.\r\n\r\nFurther research has been carried out to solve stress problems in multi-physics phenomena using a Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) frame-work. This approach has the advantage in that it uses the similarities between fluid and solid momentum equations to introduce some modifications in a CFD code that allows a complete CFD solution procedure to be used for the simultaneous calculation of the velocity, temperature and displacement variables. The results of this integrated approach are compared with results obtained by using techniques which solve the problem by 111 using two solvers (one for solid regions, one for fluid regions).\r\n\r\nIn summary, the novelty of the research detailed in this thesis is:\r\n\r\n• Finite volulne formulation for elastic large strain analysis. Comparison of this approach with traditional finite element techniques:\r\n- Cell-vertex finite volume method is as accurate as finite element approach but slower in solution time.\r\n\r\n• Finite volume formulation for structural plate analysis. Comparison with traditional finite element method:\r\n- Novel finite volume approach is as accurate as finite element approach.\r\n- Does not display locking problems (observed with finite element methods) and is comparable in solution times.\r\n\r\n• Formulation of an integrated CFD solver for coupled flow, heat transfer and stress calculations. Comparison with a 2-solver approach:\r\n- Integrated approach is much faster and substantially less memory intensive than 2-solver approach.\r\n\r\nComparisons between the new formulation and traditional approaches are made in terms of accuracy and solution speed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fallah, Nosrat Allah"],"dc:date":"2000-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316072,"sim:weight":0.591087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316091,"sim:weight":0.560803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47315,"sim:weight":0.557067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316060,"sim:weight":0.554442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75433,"sim:weight":0.546745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020442,"sim:weight":0.538083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890328,"sim:weight":0.518038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43405,"sim:weight":0.500658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101588,"sim:weight":0.494593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316056,"sim:weight":0.491128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43087,"sim:weight":0.490035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664565,"sim:weight":0.479214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381888,"sim:weight":0.469319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108134,"sim:weight":0.465892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101208,"sim:weight":0.458715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43766,"sim:weight":0.454389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.453579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020865,"sim:weight":0.452974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.452077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1018835,"sim:weight":0.448149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular this study examines the symbiotic relationship between the market town as a nodal point for industry and commerce within the context of the local economy and social structure of its rural hinterland. The nature and incidence of demographic growth within Cranbrook\u0027s neighbourhood during local periods of epidemic disease and economic dislocation, provide a context in which to examine the extent to which the Wealden wood pasture agrarian regime could absorb and sustain demographic growth within individual local economies.\r\n\r\nSocial relations within Cranbrook, show that the town was not isolated from its rural hinterland. The inhabitants of the town and the countryside interacted within a\r\nlocal economy based upon textile manufacture and farming, which effectively defined the complex social hierarchy of the \u0027neighbourhood\u0027. Kinship-networks among longstanding\r\nresident families and their comparative status, wealth and influence within individual parishes, show the importance of familial relationships to business success and social status within the community. \r\n\r\nParish office holding among Cranbrook\u0027s \u0027chief inhabitants\u0027 are explored within the concepts of religious ideology and social control in early modem England.

This\r\napproach works very well and can also deal well with temperature loading, but becomes problematic when flow and change of phase are included in a transient context. A major\r\nset of projects are under way to develop an integrated suite of algorithms to model the flow-cooling-solidification-residual stress development process. This project concerns the component associated with the development of stress-strain distributions under temperature and other loads.\r\n\r\nA control volume formulation solution procedure for the elastic stress-strain equations in two-dimensions has been developed that solves directly for displacements. The\r\nformulation works for mixtures of quadrilateral and triangular elements in an unstructured mesh. The control volume finite element code has been tested on a range\r\nof problems, such as a cantilever loaded at one end, a beam with a thermal gradient applied and a multi-material mixed element non-regular shape with a load applied. The\r\nresults for these test cases have been compared to those obtained by standard finite element codes and analytical solutions where available. Besides the plane stress and\r\nplane strain options, the model has been extended to include axisymmetric problems. Two examples are used to test the validity of the algorithm for axisymmetric problems. The results compare very well against other numerical results and analytic solutions for the three special two-dimensional cases.\r\n\r\nAnother problem considered at an inteiface is that of friction between two solids. This non-linear boundary condition has been included in the model. An example of this is Silica in a mould being pressed, results for the stress-strain code are compared to previous results. \r\n\r\nThe control volume stress-strain code has been integrated with the solidification heat transfer code. Problems of simple castings have been considered. When a liquid solidifies it may deform away from the mould, so possible air gap formation at the mould/metal inteiface has been included in the model. Prediction of hole formation in solidification, in the form of volumetric shrinkage and porosity, has been included into the coupled heat transfer stress code via a simple model.

Chapter two examines crimes against property, arguing that reasons other than gender may explain the apparent lenience towards female thieves. Women were disproportionately prosecuted for small thefts and peripheral offences like hedgebreaking and receiving: this could indicate, not that they lacked initiative, but that they were more likely to be prosecuted for offences which were overlooked when committed by men. The reverse appears to be true for physical violence, the subject of chapter three. Here the evidence suggests that men were charged for very minor assaults, whereas minor violence by women was only prosecuted in special circumstances. Almost equal numbers of men and women were prosecuted for verbal offences, the subject of chapter four, but the women were accused mainly of scolding or quarrelling with their social equals, and the men of insulting or slandering their social superiors. \r\n\r\nChapter five deals with prosecutions for sexual misconduct. Thechurch courts were relatively lenient towards females accused of fornication or adultery-, both ecclesiastical and secular jurisdictions, however, prosecuted `bawds\u0027, who were mainly female, and prostitutes, but rarely the men who used their services. Chapter six is concerned with alleged sorcerers (mainly women), and with sabbath breakers,\r\nillegal games-players and vagabonds (largely men). The concluding chapter discusses the similarity of the policies of the ecclesiastical and secular courts, and the tendency for charges against women to be vague and generalised while those against men were specific. It then focuses on the different crimes for which men and women were typically presented, particularly sexual and verbal offences for women and physical assault for men. These and other gendered offences reflect contemporary assumptions and fears about femininity and masculinity: women were expected to be quarrelsome, malicious gossips and sexual delinquents, while physical violence was expected and feared in men. \r\n\r\nIt is suggested that the way local courts exercised their considerable discretion over what, and whom, to prosecute reflected and reinforced these preconceptions, and operated both to control women and to minimise men\u0027s fears about them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Karen Margaret"],"dc:date":"2001-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383634,"sim:weight":0.646416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381986,"sim:weight":0.641826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108669,"sim:weight":0.631153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108648,"sim:weight":0.621133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383674,"sim:weight":0.590807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382058,"sim:weight":0.588393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99268,"sim:weight":0.579268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382024,"sim:weight":0.578338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48351,"sim:weight":0.557391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383631,"sim:weight":0.55485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1544,"sim:weight":0.547083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15239,"sim:weight":0.544619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8766657,"sim:weight":0.543162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108367,"sim:weight":0.535783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43191,"sim:weight":0.5209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46288,"sim:weight":0.520533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44304,"sim:weight":0.51171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85043,"sim:weight":0.511485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107053,"sim:weight":0.508763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":507102,"sim:weight":0.50647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The microscopic structure of paper consists of a random mesh of paper fibres connected by hydrogen bonds. This implies the existence of the two damage mechanisms\r\nof interest, the failure of a fibre/fibre bond and the failure of a fibre. \r\n\r\nThe majority of this work focuses on the development of a novel hybrid mathematical model which couples the mechanics of the mass/spring model to the acoustic wave propagation model for use in generating the acoustic signal emitted by complex structures of paper fibres under strain. A discussion of the coupling method is presented and the model is then analysed using a simple plucked fibre as a test case with a comparison between the numerical and experimental results.\r\n\r\nThe hybrid mathematical model is then used to simulate small fibre networks aimed at providing information on the acoustic response of each damage mechanism. To do this the\r\nmass/spring model must successfully simulate the response of the fibre structure when undergoing a fibre/fibre bond failure or a fibre failure. This can be achieved by dynamically manipulating the mass and spring elements of the fibre structure. The simulated AEs from the two damage mechanisms are then analysed using a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to provide a two dimensional time/frequency representation of the signal. From the CWT certain features of the AEs can be attributed to each damage mechanism and as such a criteria for the time and frequency properties of each damage mechanism can be formulated. This criterion provides the basis for identifying the damage mechanisms present in the experimental data. \r\n\r\nThe final contribution of this thesis is the investigation of training an intelligent classifier which can dynamically identify the AEs from the two damage mechanisms. This is achieved by converting the time and frequency criteria for each damage mechanisms into a set of features for the training of a Self-Organising Map (SOM). The significant step in this analysis is the method for the extraction of the features from the CWT of the AE.\r\n\r\nThis work successfully combines four different scientific areas, paper physics, acoustic emission technology, data analysis and computational modelling to provide an insight into the micro-mechanics of paper. The most significant contribution of this work is the development of the hybrid model which has the ability to generate the acoustic response of a paper fibre structure undergoing two different damage processes.

{"identifier":316064,"ep:Repository":51,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The corporate governance structure and corporate performance: empirical studies of China\u0027s listed real estate companies","bibo:abstract":"This study examines the effectiveness of the corporate governance mechanisms and their impact on corporate performance, using the data of one industry sector-China\u0027s listed real estate companies. The studies include four parts: (l). the ownership structure, (2). the board structure; (3). the manager compensation and (4). the agency costs measured by asset utilization efficiency and manager discretionary expenses. The empirical studies cover three years (2000 to 2002). Here I classify the listed real estate companies into the subgroups of state owned enterprises (SOEs), privately owned companies (POEs), SOEs dominated by state shares and state legal person shares for analysis. The conclusions are first, in the real estate industry of China where the market is not fully open and transparent; the land resource is controlled by the government and is transferred by the negotiation or agreement between related parties, rather than the open market price and the government has strong influence on the performance of the listed real estate companies. Although the ownership structure is diversified in the real estate industries and the POEs take part in the property market development with the SOEs, the ownership concentration is positively associated with the firm performance. The companies with highly concentrated ownership structure are state owned companies (SOEs), especially the state shares dominated SOEs. \r\n\r\nThe state shares are positively associated with firm performance, indicating the government influence on the real estate industry. This study does not support the suggestion that SOEs are more inefficient and legal person shares outperform the state shares. The study also shows that under the concentrated ownership structure, the dilution of the controlling power among more than one controlling shareholder would reduce the agency cost and improve the firm performance. \r\n\r\nThe second conclusion is that the board size is positively associated with firm performance, but the relationship is non-linear. The board with an appropriate portion of independent directors may improve the effectiveness of corporate governance. Board size is decided by the ownership structure and the adjustment of the ownership structure, e.g. increasing the number of shares owned by other large shareholders will change the board size and improve the monitoring function of the board. \r\n\r\nThe third conclusion is that the agency costs rooted in the separation of ownership and management are related with ownership structure. The largest shareholder is significant in improving the assets utilization efficiency but not significant in reducing manager discretionary expense. The presence of the other blockholders would reduce the agency costs. The agency costs POEs are higher than that in SOEs, indicating that the owner/manager in POEs who owns less than 100% of the company stake is likely to extract benefits from the abuse of the controlling right.\r\n\r\nThe fourth conclusion is that the manager\u0027s compensation of the China\u0027s listed real estate companies includes three elements, i.e. a basic salary, a position allowance and a bonus; they are all paid in cash. The managers own tiny or no equity stake of the company. Stock option is not adopted in China\u0027s listed real estate companies. Manager\u0027s compensation is not associated with the firm\u0027s performance, but is associated with firm size and the turnovers of chairmen and top managers.\r\n\r\nThe study also discusses the two fundamental issues that the corporate governance reform of China\u0027s listed companies are facing. One is the ambiguity of property rights in SOEs and another one is the inefficient managerial incentive system and the two factors are interlinked. The ambiguous property rights in SOEs have resulted in the companies being controlled by insiders in reality. The highly concentrated ownership structure has led to the board of directors being dominated by insiders-directors from the controlling shareholder and executive directors and the illiquidity of majority of shares on stock market makes the market as external governance factor ineffective. I also discuss the factors deterring the wide adoption of managerial stock option on the Chinese stock market.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ke, Qiulin"],"dc:date":"2005-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":51102,"sim:weight":0.671278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.649109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3102518,"sim:weight":0.647525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98926,"sim:weight":0.647347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103112,"sim:weight":0.634113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":861642,"sim:weight":0.620905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101477,"sim:weight":0.599037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":756165,"sim:weight":0.59639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3126295,"sim:weight":0.592043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3102776,"sim:weight":0.589877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94549,"sim:weight":0.589815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94474,"sim:weight":0.585413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5081962,"sim:weight":0.575511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5082098,"sim:weight":0.567791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5087431,"sim:weight":0.566581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43805,"sim:weight":0.565924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133449,"sim:weight":0.564437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383604,"sim:weight":0.557263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":892100,"sim:weight":0.557128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101265,"sim:weight":0.556303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Surprisingly, despite the great volume of work on women’s history during the last few decades, historians have not researched this subject in detail. While only a handful of women have become professional judges in this country, many thousands have sat in judgement on their follow citizens as lay justices. This duty is both voluntary and unpaid but it is, along with jury service, a vitally important aspect of citizenship. It is argued herein that this exercise of citizenship through the magistracy was an ongoing concern of feminists and of women’s organisations in the period. Not only did the magistracy change women by making them equal citizens, but also women changed the magistracy, by pioneering modern ideas in the work of the JP and presaging a new, quasi-professional approach.\r\n\r\nPart One examines the process by which women were brought into the lay magistracy. Chapter One locates the origins of the campaign for the appointment of women as JPs in the women’s suffrage movement and demonstrates that the necessary legislation was largely uncontroversial. Chapter Two analyses the ongoing campaign by women’s organisations and their abilities to bring more women to the magisterial bench. Chapter Three explores the relationship between the emergence of a separate system of criminal justice for juveniles and the creation of women magistrates.\r\n\r\nPart Two seeks to establish to what extent the ‘woman magistrate’ was a new category. Chapter Four analyses the social backgrounds of the first women appointed as JPs. Chapter Five is concerned with women’s experience of the magistracy, which is examined mostly through their own words. Chapter Six focuses on networks and organisations of women JPs and the campaigns they took part in, and argues that they adopted a distinctly feminist approach to their role.\r\n\r\nIt is concluded that - up to a point - the early women JPs were a new type of magistrate, providing a template for future developments in the lay magistracy after 1950.","bibo:AuthorList":["Logan, Anne Frances Helen"],"dc:date":"2002-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382011,"sim:weight":0.657167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385375,"sim:weight":0.655504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316097,"sim:weight":0.649562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43950,"sim:weight":0.636266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382077,"sim:weight":0.62542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108695,"sim:weight":0.621463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383584,"sim:weight":0.606531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8766807,"sim:weight":0.595203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.541442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101272,"sim:weight":0.538262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47022,"sim:weight":0.529171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":315976,"sim:weight":0.528582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82889,"sim:weight":0.501805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381986,"sim:weight":0.498806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316073,"sim:weight":0.493848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2707943,"sim:weight":0.492103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46590,"sim:weight":0.483003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45867,"sim:weight":0.481409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187686,"sim:weight":0.472029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":313623,"sim:weight":0.470888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study examines how masculinities were disrupted and. reconstructed during and after the war. It is a study of British men, previously civilians, who became servicemen in the First World War. It aims to map the continuities and discontinuities in the construction of their masculine identities during war and in its aftermath in the 1920s.\r\n\r\nPioneered by feminist scholars concerned with analysing the historical construction of femininity, the study of gender relations has become a significant area of historical\r\nenquiry. This has resulted in a substantial body of historical scholarship on the history of masculinities and the increasing visibility of men as gendered subjects whose masculinities are lived and imagined. This thesis is informed by, and engages with, the histories of masculinities. It also draws on recent historical research on the cultural legacy of the war. \r\n\r\nThe first chapter explores the subjectiver esponsesto becoming a soldier through an examination of personal memoirs; largely unpublished sources drawn from memories and written or recorded by men as narratives of their wartime experiences. The subject of the second chapter is shell shock. The outbreak of shell shock among the troops aroused anxieties about masculinity. The competing versions of masculinities which emerged in military and medical discourses is examined. Returning to individual memoirs, the chapter examines how men produced their own representations of the shell shocked man contesting other versions. Chapters 3 and 4 focus their attention on the relatively neglected subject of ex-servicemen\u0027s organisations and the collectivities of ex-servicemen. During and after the war a movement of ex-servicemen emerged to campaign for justice and fair treatment. Comradeship underpinned the attempt to forge an ex-serviceman identity and an examination of veterans\u0027 publications, a largely neglected source, has revealed the tensions and conflicts which contested this form of masculine identity. Masculine identities, as citizens and workers, presented a challenge to the potential for a unified, apolitical movement. Unemployment was a challenge to male identities traditionally secured through work and masculine codes of independence. \r\n\r\nUnlike many studies, this thesis intentionally straddles war and peace. It begins in 1914 and ends a decade later in a society restored to peace but still essentially in the shadow of war.","bibo:AuthorList":["Millman, Margaret"],"dc:date":"2002-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43389,"sim:weight":0.697083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81349,"sim:weight":0.696525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1544,"sim:weight":0.692314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43553,"sim:weight":0.691646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44647,"sim:weight":0.673377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767710,"sim:weight":0.667529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383551,"sim:weight":0.664476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78420,"sim:weight":0.66066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2923,"sim:weight":0.64831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1344568,"sim:weight":0.632612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4415,"sim:weight":0.63031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381966,"sim:weight":0.628895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43014,"sim:weight":0.616543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58411,"sim:weight":0.57779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94080,"sim:weight":0.576097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352200,"sim:weight":0.557535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382859,"sim:weight":0.551804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.539719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386658,"sim:weight":0.536461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.527917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

From time to time during the period, the office was exposed to political and public scrutiny that brought calls for reform. Despite that, and the general recognition that change was necessary, the process was extremely protracted and reform limited so that when the 1926 Act reached the statute book, it was greeted with a level of subdued dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThroughout the period, the coroners resisted change based on an appeal to their traditional links with the people and representing the office as an ancient institution rooted in long established custom and practice. Despite that, the coroners were unable to evade the impact of changes associated with developments in local and national government which had an indirect, though significant, effect on coroners\u0027 reform. For most of the period, the policy of successive governments was to have no policy on coroners. To fill that void,various groups with conflicting interests and ambitions proposed changes to meet their needs and attempted to influence the government to implement them. A slow, complex, haphazard, fragmented and undirected process evolved that had its own dynamic. There was no strategist, no over-riding driving force, no single source. Suggestions were adopted, modified or rejected to produce a \u0027policy\u0027 that was eventually accepted by the Home Office.\r\n\r\nFrom the detailed examination of the complex events, issues and stances adopted by the various bodies, including the Home Office, an explanation for the unusual, slow and tortuous process of reform emerges. Coroners\u0027 problems were a minor issue for the government and carried little weight in the wider scheme of politics.

Suffrage historians have generally considered Independent Labour Party men\u0027s attitudes towards women\u0027s enfranchisement to have been positive: their ideas and activities are now placed under careful scrutiny. \r\n\r\nThe theoretical underpinnings of the thesis lie in gender history, most especially in the field of historical studies of masculinities, which in themselves have been informed by the ideas and writings of women\u0027s history. Independent Labour Party men are viewed not as a group of individuals with certain physical characteristics in common, but as sharing gendered identities as socialists and as men, which influenced their attitudes towards the roles deemed appropriate for men and women within society, and towards women\u0027s emancipation in particular. Furthermore, the thesis assesses how their ideas and identities were themselves challenged by developments within the suffrage movement. \r\n\r\nChapter 1 considers the years between 1893-5, a period characterised by few formal links between Independent Labour Party men and the suffrage movement, and assesses how supportive attitudes towards women\u0027s enfranchisement fitted into prevailing understandings of socialism and independent labour representation. Chapters 2 and 3, focusing respectively on the periods between 1895-1905, and 1905-1911, consider the impact of a burgeoning suffrage movement, active within the ranks of the labour movement itself, and characterised by its own priorities, objectives and tactics. Chapter 4, dealing with the years between 1911-1914, concludes by assessing Independent Labour Party men\u0027s responses to a shift in the suffrage debate, as the introduction in Parliament of adult suffrage became a practical proposition.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ugolini, Laura"],"dc:date":"1997-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":315976,"sim:weight":0.645626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108695,"sim:weight":0.637532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.611804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664662,"sim:weight":0.599669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56356,"sim:weight":0.58939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59086,"sim:weight":0.583095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58420,"sim:weight":0.568607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382035,"sim:weight":0.568397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382064,"sim:weight":0.56517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44423,"sim:weight":0.552787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108401,"sim:weight":0.548784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29218,"sim:weight":0.545474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101251,"sim:weight":0.534096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382011,"sim:weight":0.530893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316097,"sim:weight":0.522628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383584,"sim:weight":0.522529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316055,"sim:weight":0.515302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352200,"sim:weight":0.506936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383935,"sim:weight":0.497887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352196,"sim:weight":0.495974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":316074,"ep:Repository":51,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Origin and development of internal stresses during polymerization of composite resins","bibo:abstract":"This study is focused on the development of polymerization stresses. These are non functional stresses and arise especially when the adhesive composite materials are cured in a cavity, in which the polymerization contraction is\r\nrestrained by the cavity walls. During masticatory functioning these residual polymerization stresses elevate the overall stress levels. They exercise a cumulative effect, and therefore it is essential to evaluate the internal prestressed state of the tooth-composite complex. \r\n\r\nTo study the stress conditions in these complexes, the right tools have to be employed. These consist of dynamic material properties during polymerization, and an appropriate equivalent stress expression for the strength differential effect. \r\n\r\nThe origin of polymerization stresses is a combination of volumetric contraction and development of stiffness during the curing process. Two stages can be distinguished: pre-gel and post-gel. Because stiffness develops after the gel-point, only the post-gel phase plays a role in the development of polymerization stresses. An enhanced strain gage method is developed to determine the dynamic post-gel linear contraction. The development of elastic modulus cannot be measured directly, but has to be assessed indirectly through a polymerization stress evaluation. \r\n\r\nIn an attempt to derive the modulus development, strain and stress data are combined. It turns out that the rate of strain and stress development is greatly dependent on the curing rate, and therefore on the test setup. Two temperature effects(exothermic heating and radiation of the curing light), which play an important role in the volumetric phenomena during the polymerization, are also investigated. Polymerization stress concentrations as a result of different filling techniques are analyzed in a finite element calculation. The numerical analysis suggests that an incremental filling technique raises stresses and cusp displacements. Furthermore, it shows that it is not necessary to model the timedependent behaviour of the development of mechanical parameters if the worsed case is sought.","bibo:AuthorList":["Versluis, Antheunis"],"dc:date":"1994-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":776806,"sim:weight":0.525851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1027134,"sim:weight":0.522518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101506,"sim:weight":0.448459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75609,"sim:weight":0.443121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27098,"sim:weight":0.43004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1080662,"sim:weight":0.427144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43483,"sim:weight":0.423802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1084723,"sim:weight":0.423598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101255,"sim:weight":0.421152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1079333,"sim:weight":0.420938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18081,"sim:weight":0.419371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383227,"sim:weight":0.409953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":779121,"sim:weight":0.40885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1072062,"sim:weight":0.407157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43797,"sim:weight":0.401553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316488,"sim:weight":0.400383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43390,"sim:weight":0.398643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75634,"sim:weight":0.385393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27821,"sim:weight":0.384469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75460,"sim:weight":0.377115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These materials are currently being developed as a bone cement in joint replacement surgery. \r\n\r\nInitially, a simple quaternary (25i02-Al203-CaO-CaF2) glass was produced and was found to undergo minimal fluorine loss. This results in a glass whose composition is reproducible between batches. \r\n\r\nThis composition, however, was too reactive to form a glass ionomer cement. A glass-ceramic approach was pursued to deactivate the glass and following heat treatments, cements were produced whose properties varied depending upon the precise heat treatment used.\r\n\r\nThe heat treatments above the glass transition temperature resulted in amorphous phase separation, probably by a spinodal decomposition mechanism, followed by a two stage crystallization of calcium fluoride (fluorite) and anorthite. The anorthite phase crystallized from fluorite nuclei and, in effect, crystallization occurred by a bulk nucleation mechanism. \r\n\r\nThe glass will also undergo significant crystallization to fluorite below the glass transition temperature, with surface nucleation the dominant mechanism. This explains the deactivation of ionomer glasses used commercially to control the setting properties of dental glass ionomer cements. \r\n\r\nThe structural role of fluorine in these glasses was also investigated. It seems that fluorine is present in the glass network, rather than existing as a discreet entity bonded to a modifying cation. There is evidence that the fluoride ions are bonded only to aluminium sites and act to disrupt network connectivity.\r\n\r\nA commercial glass was examined and was found to be clearly phase separated. This glass was found to crystallize to apatite and mullite. Apatite is the mineral phase of bone and enamel and this may explain the excellent biocornpatability of glass ionomer cements. \r\n\r\nGlasses containing sodium and phosphate ions have also been produced. The sodium containing glasses were all found to crystallize from the melt to calcium fluoride. The phosphate containing glasses formed cements without any subsequent modification, and following a simple heat treatment, all of the phosphate containing glasses were found again to crystallize initially to an apatite phase.\r\n\r\nSelected compositions additionally crystallized to mullite. These glass-ceramics were tougher than the base glasses and this is attributed to the presence of interlocking needles of the two phases. Some of the glasses were easily castable to produce optically clear glasses, and in addition the glasses underwent bulk nucleation via prior amorphous phase separation, to give needles of apatite and mullite. These glass-ceramics thus show tremendous potential for use as a bloactive bone substitute material or as a castable crown.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wood, David John"],"dc:date":"1993-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75400,"sim:weight":0.725241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59106,"sim:weight":0.615101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44493,"sim:weight":0.609281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":888402,"sim:weight":0.602564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98544,"sim:weight":0.597404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381963,"sim:weight":0.587906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18148,"sim:weight":0.583431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1117520,"sim:weight":0.582977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5837083,"sim:weight":0.582939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5850863,"sim:weight":0.580772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383535,"sim:weight":0.580217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50780,"sim:weight":0.565208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105057,"sim:weight":0.56142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146047,"sim:weight":0.555371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50791,"sim:weight":0.550436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":584672,"sim:weight":0.537616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44469,"sim:weight":0.519153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1023982,"sim:weight":0.502473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98573,"sim:weight":0.483999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46771,"sim:weight":0.475046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Previously considered as a secondary pest of stressed and dying trees, it is now receiving considerable attention as a vector of the pine wood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the causal agent of a lethal wilting disease in susceptible species of pines.  Adult beetles are attracted to traps baited with a kairomone blend consisting of a host volatile, α-pinene, and two bark beetle pheromone components, ipsenol and 2-methyl-3-butenol.  More recently it has been shown that mature male M. galloprovincialis produce a pheromone attracting mature females in a laboratory bioassay.  In the present work volatiles were collected from mature male and female M. galloprovincialis and a compound produced specifically by mature males was identified as 2-undecyloxy-1-ethanol from its gas chromatographic retention times, its mass spectrum, and by comparison with synthetic standards.  The naturally-derived and synthetic compounds elicited electroantennographic responses from both females and males.  Sealed polyethylene vials and polyethylene sachets were shown to be effective dispensers with zero-order release, the latter giving a higher release rate than the former.  In two field tests, multiple-funnel traps baited with synthetic 2-undecyloxy-1-ethanol caught both female and male M. galloprovincialis, with higher catches at the higher release rate.  This compound also synergized the attractiveness of the kairomone blend, the combined mixture catching 80-140% more beetles than the sum of the catches with each bait separately and luring up to 2 beetles/trap/d in a moderate-density population.  We conclude that 2-undecyloxy-1-ethanol is a male-produced aggregation pheromone of M. galloprovincialis.  This is the first example of a sex-specific compound in the cerambycid subfamily Lamiinae with significant behavioral activity in the field at a range sufficient to make it a useful trap bait.  The possible roles of this pheromone in the chemical ecology of M. galloprovincialis and its potential use in pine wilt disease management are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pajares, Juan A.","Álvarez, Gonzalo","Ibeas, Fernando","Gallego, Diego","Hall, David R.","Farman, Dudley I."],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":897307,"sim:weight":0.256441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59935,"sim:weight":0.220362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1010015,"sim:weight":0.198434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3143,"sim:weight":0.181707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27010,"sim:weight":0.177183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.175146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145982,"sim:weight":0.164815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.162866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43383,"sim:weight":0.152197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51,"sim:weight":0.150388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108684,"sim:weight":0.137165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316045,"sim:weight":0.135923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44827,"sim:weight":0.133012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99116,"sim:weight":0.132489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643700,"sim:weight":0.120211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.118832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.116664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.116664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99161,"sim:weight":0.115476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63369,"sim:weight":0.113333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Banks in Jordan, the focus of this study, are not immune from the exposure to the risks.\r\nThe banking sector in Jordan is the most important in the Jordanian national economy and has effectively contributed to improving economic development through its important role in mobilising savings and channelling them into different fields of investment.\r\nTherefore, the overall aim of this research is to propose that developing a knowledge management (KM) approach to support managing credit risk will help banks in general, and Jordanian banks in particular, in improving the process of managing credit risk.\r\nTo reach the aim, several objectives have been constructed:\r\n1. Reviewing current status of KM and its relationship with CRM\r\n2. Developing a scale to measure KM behaviour and practices\r\n3. Determining current KM status in Jordanian banks\r\n4. Building a CR decision support system using internal implicit knowledge to reduce the rate of defaults.\r\nAs a result of this research, a KM approach has been developed to support managing credit risk. The approach contains the following steps: identify, measure, analyse, improve, and evaluate.\r\nUsing the new KM approach, the main conclusion of this research suggest that considering credit risk management and KM together gives a much stronger basis for banks to manage credit risk.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Shawabkeh, Abdallah"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":81183,"sim:weight":0.677453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81438,"sim:weight":0.626935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106858,"sim:weight":0.561002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383613,"sim:weight":0.5404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":117202,"sim:weight":0.532598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.521301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.521301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.521301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.521301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.521301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.521301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.521301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.521301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.521301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.521301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.521301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.521301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.521301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.521301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665714,"sim:weight":0.519733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This was achieved by obtaining verbal narrative accounts of their experiences of using self-injury from its onset during childhood or early adolescence, throughout adolescence and into adulthood. These verbatim accounts formed a corpus of data which was analysed using a grounded theory method. This process established seven robust categories associated with the use of self-injury consisting of behavioural, cognitive, emotional, social, occupational, communication and physiological experiences. By thoroughly examining these categories the development of self-injury as a versatile multi-functional behaviour emerged which was governed by the individuals‟ needs. Evidence for these multiple uses stemmed from the similarities that developed in the individuals‟ use of self-injury over time. Highlighting these multiple functions it was established that improved social, communication and occupational conditions were crucial aspects in the participants‟ reduction in using self-injury. The contribution this research has made towards developing our understanding of self-injury was addressed, particularly in relation to its use by the non-clinically defined members of the general public who took part, and in the context of advancing relevant nursing research and practice. Several critical aspects of the methodology were identified, in particular the restrictive generalisation of the findings to others who self-injure, and the use of retrospective accounts were discussed and directives were outlined to improve these aspects in future research. Proposals were made for further research to clarify and investigate the multiple functions of self-injury and to increase our understanding of the continuing use of covert self-injury during adulthood. Additionally, the relevance of the findings to nursing practice, principally in relation to adequately assessing the use of self-injury was discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barton-Breck, Andrew J.

The study specifically explored the impact of socio-personal attitudinal and behavioural factors that may impede participation. \r\n\r\nThe research was concentrated in a South East London borough and based within a successful joint initiative between a local authority and third sector organisations. This unique partnership, of over 25 centres, provided access to the hardest to reach groups in the deprived communities of the borough.

The principal focus of this study is Azjen’s social psychological Theory of Planned Behaviour (TpB) which was concerned with localised social determinants of the individual. Research data was collected through questionnaires based on TpB and the raw data derived from these were statistically analysed using inferential statistics, chi-square (x2) on SPSS. In addition, a number of interviews were also carried out to gain further insight into the broad perceptions of the individuals. Interview transcripts were analysed and two emergent themes identified: attitude and behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe statistical analysis revealed that latent experiences and perception played a vital role in individuals’ life choices. These provide the foundation of the socio-personal factors that impact on socially excluded adults and influence their attitudes, behaviour and decision making process. In this study these have been shown to have an impact on attitudes towards any sort of learning/training including IT skills. The combination of poor experiences of school, no/low academic achievement, low self-esteem and confidence, along with a fear of failure has led to lives of worklessness or a continuous cycle of low skilled, low-waged employment, vulnerable to economic change.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a minor analysis contributed through Bourdieu’s concepts established that the individual’s social class/group produced inherent issues of almost unconsciously accepted differentiation between the dominated and dominant classes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Choli, Hatice"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.670563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.624443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94097,"sim:weight":0.603108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.590608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.583537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.582741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631808,"sim:weight":0.581619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":517339,"sim:weight":0.572157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.562268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.549602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.549602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.549602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.549602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.549602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.549602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.549602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.549602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.549602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.549602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.549602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A number of issues, relevant at the time, have been considered including: a) in vitro methods predictive of in vivo therapeutic index of anti-inflammatory efficacy over emetic side effects, b) in vivo methods for confirming therapeutic index and c) early confirmation of functional activity in a human system. In addition to 10 peer-reviewed articles, a poster presented at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) conference in 1999 and a review article published in Trends in Pharmacological Sciences (publication 1) in 1997 are also included. \r\n\r\nIn the initial work (publication 2) to investigate if it was possible to correlate in vitro activity with in vivo efficacy for PDE4 inhibitors structurally diverse compounds were tested in a series of experimental systems. The compounds tested were SB 207499, LAS 31025, CDP 840, rolipram and RP 73401. The in vitro experiments consisted of PDE4 enzyme activity (guinea pig and human inflammatory cells) and rolipram binding activity, RBA (rat brain). The in vivo model used was the guinea pig skin model of eosinophil recruitment, which involves systemic 111In-eosinophil recruitment to guinea pig skin induced by a range of inflammatory mediators [i.e. PCA, PAF and zymosan activated plasma (ZAP)]. Previous studies with PDE4 inhibitors had not examined the correlation between in vitro and in vivo activities in this way. RP73401 was the most potent PDE4 enzyme inhibitor (guinea pig macrophage) followed by SB 207499\u003eCDP 840\u003e rolipram\u003eLAS 31025. Rolipram binding activity did not follow the same ranking, though RP73401 was again the most potent followed by rolipram\u003eSB 207499\u003eCDP 840\u003eLAS31025. Attenuation of eosinophil recruitment was consistently observed regardless of inflammogen with the following rank order of potency: RP 73401\u003d rolipram\u003eLAS 31025\u003eSB 207499\u003eCDP 840. In this model no correlation was found between the in vitro activities and in vivo efficacy. A cell based in vitro assay, LPS induced TNF release from human PBMCs was also included in this publication. All of the PDE4 inhibitors tested were efficacious in this assay with a potency order of: RP 73401\u003eSB 207499 \u003d rolipram \u003d CDP 840\u003eLAS 31025.\r\n\r\nIn publications 3-7, in vitro and in vivo data are presented on a large number of compounds from a diverse range of chemical classes. In all cases the in vitro focus pertains to the ratio of PDE4 enzyme activity to rolipram binding activity (PDE4:RBA) as a method of selecting compounds with an improved therapeutic index of anti-inflammatory efficacy over emetic side effects. In these publications emesis data were included together with efficacy data in order to determine if in vitro predictions of therapeutic index were of relevance in vivo. The drug classes examined were xanthines, aryl sulphonamides, quinolones, 7-methoxybenzofuran-4-carboxamides, and 7-methoxyfuro[2,3-c]pyridine-4-carboxamides. The lead molecules selected in each publication had improved PDE4:RBA ratios which translated into an improved therapeutic window in vivo. These generated lead molecules (compound numbers from publication); corresponding PDE4:RBA ratios, skin eosinophilia efficacious dose and ferret non-emetic doses are as follows: publication 3, xanthine (3c), 4.1, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg; publication 4, aryl sulphonamide (20), \u003c0.6, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg; publication 5, quinolone (7g), \u003c0.7, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg; publication 6, 7-methoxybenzofuran-4-carboxamides (3a), 0.37, 0.5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and publication 7, 7-methoxyfuro[2,3-c]pyridine-4-carboxamides (8a), 0.16, 10 mg/kg (lung eosinophilia), not evaluated in the ferret.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the method for the selection of novel PDE4 inhibitors for the treatment of inflammation associated with respiratory diseases was to nominate compounds into drug development. The molecules had to successfully exhibit all of the criteria set in the screening cascade to be considered safe and efficacious enough to be tested in clinical trials. Publication 8 and the ATS poster refer to the first development compound nominated for clinical development, D 4418. This compound demonstrated efficacy in the guinea pig lung model of airway function, eosinophil infiltration and bronchial hyperreactivity at 10 mg/kg, p.o. and did not evoke emesis in the ferret at 100 mg/kg. In a Phase I clinical trial when dosed between 5 and 200 mg, D 4418 had a good pharmacokinetic profile and only mild side effects of headache, dizziness and nausea but no vomiting. No further clinical development was carried out with this molecule. \r\n\r\nPublications 9, 10 and 11 refer to the discovery, synthesis and pharmacology of a second development candidate, SCH 351591. This compound was more potent than D 4418 both in vitro and in vivo and had a wider therapeutic index for efficacy over side effects. SCH 351591 demonstrated efficacy in the guinea pig lung model of airway function, eosinophil infiltration and bronchial hyperreactivity at 0.3 mg/kg, p.o. and did not evoke emesis in the ferret at 5 mg/kg showing it to have a promising preclinical profile for the treatment of respiratory inflammation. \r\n\r\nDue to the final submitted publication being dated as 2002 two sections are included at the end of this thesis to cover further work carried out on SCH 351591 and in the PDE4 area from 2002 to date.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cooper, Nicola"],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1027522,"sim:weight":0.307048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9028213,"sim:weight":0.303654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":775362,"sim:weight":0.276539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.252855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99258,"sim:weight":0.248385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":775366,"sim:weight":0.248255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.248086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.247936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":774984,"sim:weight":0.241517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26486,"sim:weight":0.241483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23872,"sim:weight":0.241483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2701685,"sim:weight":0.240688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14684,"sim:weight":0.228671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5792781,"sim:weight":0.222615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.221626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98758,"sim:weight":0.219772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":966907,"sim:weight":0.218331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.217951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99673,"sim:weight":0.217208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.215353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":316085,"ep:Repository":51,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics in dendritic solidification","bibo:abstract":"The focus of this work is to investigate the effects of applying an external magnetic field to a solidifying liquid metal melt. The principle is that thermoelectric currents that are naturally inherent to solidification processes will interact with this magnetic field, resulting in a Lorentz force. This force will exist in a microscopic region in the vicinity of the solidification front, generating microscopic fluid flow in the liquid region which can significantly effect the mechanism of dendritic growth. The work contained in this thesis provides an initial insight into the complex behaviour of this process, through the use of numerical models.\r\n\r\nTo model the soldification dynamics, an enthalpy based model for dendritic growth in a supercooled melt is used in 2-dimensions and extended into 3-dimensions. The dendrite is defined as being equiaxed in nature and, for purely diffusion driven growth, numerical calculations show a good agreement with other methods under similar growth parameters. To investigate the effects of fluid dynamics, dendritic growth is tested under forced convection conditions and significant morphological changes occur. The incident tip velocity is increased and the downstream tip velocity is decreased; in agreement with many other authors investigating similar situations.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of a magnetic field the Lorentz force will form in planes perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. Due to the morphology and anisotropy of the surface temperature, the nature of the flow is dependent on the relative orientation of the magnetic field and the crystallographic orientation of the lattice. Using a low\r\nmagnetic field strength approximation, thus removing the non-linear and resistive terms in Navier-Stokes equation, the resulting fluid velocity is arbitrarily small so that convective transport is negated. At some time, when the morphological features of a dendrite are apparent,\r\nsteady state simulations show the flow fields that exist with different orientations of the magnetic field. The results are compared to an analytic solution for the Lorentz force, which is described by reducing the morphology of a dendrite to a sphere and assuming that the surface temperature is equivalent to the anisotropy in the surface\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nWhen the thermoelectric currents are large and the magnetic field strength is substantial the convective transport, non-linear and resistive terms become significant. The problem is purely 3-dimensional and it is shown that classical 2-dimensional boundary conditions lead to stagnant conditions. A 2-dimensional quasi 3-dimensional approximation is proposed and, with the magnetic field orientated in the\r\n(001) direction, the effect of heat and solute redistribution through convection on the crystal morphology is modelled. Two significant morphological changes occur; the first is a deflection of the dendrite tip and the second is the initiation of secondary branching into the incident flow. The deflection is caused by circulations at the tips of the dendrite; the circulations continuously provide a region of higher free energy on the incident side while lowering it on the other. The net effect is a bias of growth in the direction of incident flow. The increase in secondary branching, in a similar fashion to the deflection,\r\nis caused by both a circulation at the tip and also a global circulation around the entire dendrite, destabilising the incident interface and initiating secondary growth. To qualify the quasi 3-dimensional approximation, a moving mesh technique is developed that tracks a single tip of 3-dimensional growth and the similar morphological features\r\nare observed in comparison to the quasi 3-dimensional case.\r\n\r\nFinally a discussion into possible extensions of this work is proposed and preliminary results for grain growth in the presence of a magnetic field are given.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kao, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1145764,"sim:weight":0.394155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105026,"sim:weight":0.356376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710130,"sim:weight":0.308349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":287003,"sim:weight":0.303182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.295388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.291941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28024,"sim:weight":0.291338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316056,"sim:weight":0.288929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664565,"sim:weight":0.286128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48331,"sim:weight":0.280144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98760,"sim:weight":0.272661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77295,"sim:weight":0.26828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98944,"sim:weight":0.26616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99257,"sim:weight":0.263419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98551,"sim:weight":0.258889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268052,"sim:weight":0.257159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51414,"sim:weight":0.252795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98556,"sim:weight":0.252771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102616,"sim:weight":0.248453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77180,"sim:weight":0.244494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Several studies have been conducted to determine the factors affecting financial sustainability of microfinance institutions using large and well developed MFIs in various countries. However, no such study has been conducted in rural Tanzania where majority of MFIs are small, most of which are member-based (cooperatives). Consequently, the factors affecting their financial sustainability are not known. This study, therefore, was set to bridge this knowledge gap.\r\n\r\nThis study followed a quantitative research approach using panel data regression as the main data analysis technique. The study was based on four years primary and secondary data obtained from 98 sampled rural MFIs in Tanzania. We found that microfinance capital structure, interest rates charged, differences in lending type, cost per borrower, product type, MFI size, number of borrowers, yield on gross loan portfolio, level of portfolio at risk, liquidity level, staff productivity, and the operating efficiency affect the financial sustainability of rural microfinance institutions in Tanzania.\r\n\r\nThe study makes the following key contributions to knowledge in addition to determining factors affecting financial sustainability of rural microfinance institutions in Tanzania: First, the study reveals that there exists simultaneous causality relationship between financial sustainability and breadth of outreach. When this relationship is not considered in determining factors affecting financial sustainability there may be inconsistent evidence on the existence of mission drift. Second, it unveils the trade-off between financial sustainability and breadth of outreach with regards to the minimum loan size when group lending is used. That is, larger loan size, while improves profitability, reduces the breadth of outreach. Third, the study provides empirical evidence that the impact of a particular lending type on microfinance institution‟s profitability will depend on the term to maturity and number of instalments reflected in its lending terms. Fourth, consistent with the institutionists‟ view, the study provides empirical evidence that financial sustainability of microfinance institutions improves their breadth of outreach. Lastly, the study documents the applicability and limitations of previous studies to rural microfinance institutions in Tanzania.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nyamsogoro, Ganka Daniel"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1078774,"sim:weight":0.747359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631847,"sim:weight":0.724079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316610,"sim:weight":0.599674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":328721,"sim:weight":0.590499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316611,"sim:weight":0.586754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95543,"sim:weight":0.582199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75839,"sim:weight":0.581369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631727,"sim:weight":0.558025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3126258,"sim:weight":0.534705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65879,"sim:weight":0.506658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":632630,"sim:weight":0.486915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77763,"sim:weight":0.46434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316612,"sim:weight":0.418694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316326,"sim:weight":0.405967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133276,"sim:weight":0.343461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43599,"sim:weight":0.306372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108207,"sim:weight":0.304157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101473,"sim:weight":0.30273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44471,"sim:weight":0.297088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773103,"sim:weight":0.294216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

DFT calculations, at the B3-LYP/cc-pVDZ level, established that the structures and vibrational spectra of the molecules can be interpreted using a model with hydrogen-bonded water molecules, in conjunction with the conductor-like polarizable continuum solvation method. The vibrational spectra were computed at the optimised molecular geometry, enabling normal coordinate analysis, which yielded satisfactory agreement with the experimental IR and Raman data. Computed potential energy distributions of the normal modes provided detailed vibrational assignments. Solid-state pseudopotential-plane-wave DFT calculations, using the PW91 functional, were also carried out reflecting the importance of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the solid state.\r\n\r\nSolid state IR and Raman as well as aqueous solution state Raman spectra are reported for the anions of urazole and 4-methylurazole, and their N-deuterated derivatives. DFT calculations, at the B3-LYP/cc-pVTZ level, established that the structures and vibrational spectra of both anions can be interpreted using a model that incorporates hydrogen-bonded water molecules, in conjunction with the polarizable continuum solvation method. In the case of the urazole anion it is shown that deprotonation occurs primarily at N1 rather than N4, but there is also evidence for the second tautomeric structure in both in the solid state and in aqueous solution. The vibrational spectra were computed at the optimised molecular geometry in each case, enabling normal coordinate analysis, which yielded satisfactory agreement with the experimental IR and Raman data. Computed potential energy distributions of the normal modes provided detailed vibrational assignments.\r\n\r\nIR and Raman spectra have been obtained for N, N\u0027–dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) in the solid state and in CHCl3 solution. Structures and vibrational spectra of isolated gas phase DCC molecules with C2 and Ci symmetries, computed at the B3-LYP/cc-pVTZ level, show that the IR and Raman spectra provide convincing evidence for a C2 structure in both the solid and CHCl3 solution states. Using a scaled quantum-chemical force field these DFT calculations have provided detailed assignments of the observed IR and Raman bands in terms of potential energy distributions. Comparison of solid state and solution spectra, together with a Raman study of the melting behaviour of DCC, revealed that no solid state effects were evident in the spectra.\r\n\r\nHomopolymeric poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and poly(4-vinylpyridine) as well as copolymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide/4-vinylpyridine) [poly(NIPAM/4-VP)] microgels (the latter synthesized using percentage composition of 4-VP in the range of 7.5 – 90 %, w/w in the original reaction mixture) were prepared by surfactant-free emulsion polymerization. Freeze-dried samples of the microgels were subjected to analysis by Raman spectroscopy using 632.8 nm exciting radiation from a helium-neon laser. The Raman spectral profiles of the different microgels are compared and contrasted in the 600-1100 cm-1 wavenumber region. In the case of the poly(NIPAM/4-VP) copolymer microgels, differing in monomer composition, Raman spectroscopy can be employed as a quick/easy method to ensure that co-polymerization has occurred and also to determine, semi-quantitatively, the percentage incorporation of the 4-VP monomer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ryall, John P."],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1004332,"sim:weight":0.413307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1004337,"sim:weight":0.386715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5835255,"sim:weight":0.385743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1004333,"sim:weight":0.363793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":861789,"sim:weight":0.349299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9552855,"sim:weight":0.338028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512638,"sim:weight":0.313122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":635682,"sim:weight":0.305957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98609,"sim:weight":0.287514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":776965,"sim:weight":0.280807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108054,"sim:weight":0.276476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108499,"sim:weight":0.27387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43348,"sim:weight":0.273439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113592,"sim:weight":0.271649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1494390,"sim:weight":0.268016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84771,"sim:weight":0.266007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77186,"sim:weight":0.265065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":957352,"sim:weight":0.258349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43289,"sim:weight":0.254009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108585,"sim:weight":0.253791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The author used an ethnographic approach to investigate how these women coped and how service providers, including carers, met their needs. The author used participant observation in his role as Occupational Therapist (and son) to gain access to this sample. He asked them to keep written diaries about their day-to-day experiences of living with the illness. These diaries were later given to the author to read, study and analyse. Additionally, the author’s personal ethnography as a son was submitted as data for this study. This ethnographic writing centred on the life of one sole informant, his mother, who later died with the disease in hospital.\r\n\r\nQualitative data analysis (QDA) techniques with grounded theory origins (Glaser and Strauss 1965,1967 and Charmaz 2007) was used to analyse the data. The techniques comprised of line-by-line analysis and coding, constant comparison of cases, thematic analysis, theoretical sampling and the development of framework tables. The study revealed a range of findings, which were later conceptualised into an ethnographic ontology of lupus. First, people encounter a daily struggle to cope with illness symptoms. Second, there was evidence of poor communication between the hospital ward staff (and carers) and failure for social workers to be the main advisor/counsellor of end of life care needs including missing referrals to hospice services.\r\n\r\nHealth and social care professionals sometimes struggle to provide a basic level of service leading to a “know do” gap. This leads to an inconsistent level of end of life care for the individual and limited support for the identified carers. Narratives in diary form have a role to play in helping clinical teams develop meaningful insights into their life of their patients. Clinical teams in turn need to be forthright enough to develop “death covenants” for all patients (and their carers) with palliative care needs. Developing these tools and including them as intervention turn will lead to more cohesive practices within health and social care (Dean 1996, Dean and Melrose 1996, Mol 2008).","bibo:AuthorList":["Robin, Blaine"],"dc:date":"2010-06-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108429,"sim:weight":0.673487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643980,"sim:weight":0.620071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386691,"sim:weight":0.615894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.609064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108698,"sim:weight":0.605372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225641,"sim:weight":0.603455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664616,"sim:weight":0.59208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43411,"sim:weight":0.583119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111803,"sim:weight":0.57476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2926,"sim:weight":0.572849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146036,"sim:weight":0.563979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43408,"sim:weight":0.562192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929976,"sim:weight":0.561982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83228,"sim:weight":0.559874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821356,"sim:weight":0.556693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145923,"sim:weight":0.553452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666108,"sim:weight":0.551651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81539,"sim:weight":0.549125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768452,"sim:weight":0.542246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795330,"sim:weight":0.532718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This involved the numerical simulation of two-phase, three-dimensional, buoyant, turbulent, recirculating flows. The simulations were carried out in two successive and distinct stages. \r\n\r\nThe first stage dealt with the modelling of buoyant hot turbulent gas flows generated by a fire within room-sized compartments. These single phase studies were based on the field modelling approach to fire simulation. \r\n\r\nThe second part of the study involved the introduction of the cold water droplets through a single sprinkler head, thus, extending the scenario into the more complex two-phase regime. This led to expanding the single-phase fire model to take account of two concurrently present phases, ie. gas/liquid. The strategy used to model the twophase process was the Eulerian-Eulerian technique or volume-fraction method. In order to take into account the physics involved in this process, interphase friction or drag was considered. Furthermore, due to the large difference in temperatures between the hot gases and the cold water droplets it was necessary to introduce interphase heat transfer. Due to the subsequent evaporation of the water droplets interphase mass transfer was also accounted for. \r\n\r\nModels for both steady-state and time-dependent situations were developed, whereby experimental results of transient fire-sprinkler tests were used for validation. The simulations performed indicated the creation of extremely complex flow fields within the compartments both prior and during sprinkler activation. Phenomena such as the significant cooling of the hot combustion gases caused by the active sprinkler and the evaporation of water droplets have also been predicted. This has been verified by the experimental data. Thus, it can be concluded that the models outlined herein are capable of simulating the complex two-phase fire-sprinkler scenarios. \r\n\r\nThe need for subsequent investigative studies into such areas as the effect of using different auxiliary relationships eg. heat transfer, sprinkler characteristics and gridspacing has been highlighted. In order to complete the validation process, further experimental data needs to be made available. \r\n\r\nThis two-phase technique has proven to be very computationally intensive with simulations requiring days of CPU time. \u0027Mis is clearly unacceptable. However, it is\r\nsuggested that parallel computing technology may provide a means for reducing the CPU time involved to hours.\r\n\r\nIt can be concluded that though the model developed requires further investigation and refinements, it provides a basis for a practical and useful fire engineering tool.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hoffmann, Nicole Andrea"],"dc:date":"1990-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4887796,"sim:weight":0.600683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98588,"sim:weight":0.592918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5626662,"sim:weight":0.521402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26910,"sim:weight":0.46359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.440192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664565,"sim:weight":0.427812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101390,"sim:weight":0.419817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46104,"sim:weight":0.415292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1569029,"sim:weight":0.409701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43200,"sim:weight":0.405676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387380,"sim:weight":0.39993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9017825,"sim:weight":0.398982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48331,"sim:weight":0.395858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.394104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75482,"sim:weight":0.387938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101418,"sim:weight":0.383393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107078,"sim:weight":0.381341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98925,"sim:weight":0.37425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46943,"sim:weight":0.371627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43570,"sim:weight":0.371306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The purpose of the study was to determine the significance of boys\u0027 attitudes to physical education, motor performance and physical education self-esteem (self-perceptions of performance in physical education) at the age of school transfer, and establish the role of physical education before and during adjustment to secondary school.\r\n\r\nIndependent samples of Primary schoolboys (n \u003d 50) and secondary schoolboys(n \u003d 107) formed a cross-sectional study, whilst twenty-five primary school transferees formed a small-scale longitudinal study. Pupils\u0027 attitudes towards\r\nphysical education, motor performance and physical education self-esteem (PESE) were assessed during the last term at primary school and on two occasions (December and June) during the first year at secondary school. In addition, global self-esteem and anxiety were measured at each stage, and a self-report school transfer questionnaire was administered at the end of the transfer year. From these\r\nsources, low self-esteem, high anxiety and negative attitudes to secondary school were used as indicators of poor school adjustment.\r\n\r\nDifferences amongst the psychological variables across transfer revealed that the move to secondary school appeared to be a positive experience for most boys. However, those boys identified as poorly adjusted to secondary school were less sure of themselves, more anxious, and recorded lower global and physical education self-esteem. Correlational analysis and discriminant analysis of low, average, and high motor performers (actual and perceived) revealed that poor motor performance was not consistently associated with low global self-esteem, high anxiety, or poor school adjustment. In contrast, low physical education selfesteem was associated with negative psychological characteristics and all the indicators of poor secondary school adjustment. Findings also suggested that physical education self-esteem may serve (1) as a mediating variable between actual motor performance and global self-esteem, and (2) as a mediating variable between physical education experiences and school adjustment.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the results, a preliminary model of secondary school adjustment incorporating physical education is presented for discussion and empirical test. Also in light of the study\u0027s findings, the National Curriculum for England and Wales is analysed to consider the extent to which physical education experiences are likely to assist children\u0027s motor and psychological development before transfer and during secondary school adjustment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Reeves, Colin Geoffrey"],"dc:date":"1997","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101201,"sim:weight":0.623111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101471,"sim:weight":0.623111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731806,"sim:weight":0.512066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229797,"sim:weight":0.505942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108221,"sim:weight":0.503126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1388440,"sim:weight":0.501306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":840304,"sim:weight":0.493308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654264,"sim:weight":0.49125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49910,"sim:weight":0.487837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.459599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5065550,"sim:weight":0.448183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82913,"sim:weight":0.445899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5859813,"sim:weight":0.441714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46804,"sim:weight":0.43398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381950,"sim:weight":0.429736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1130654,"sim:weight":0.428039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.417524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48401,"sim:weight":0.402907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46723,"sim:weight":0.397948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101496,"sim:weight":0.395636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The method solves and stores all variables at the element centres which lowers storage requirements and generally shortens run times compared with the Control Volume-Finite Element approach.\r\n\r\nCorrection terms are formulated which address two of the main forms of errors caused by mesh skewness.\r\n\r\nTo allow a generic handling of any unstructured mesh the Cartesian components of velocity are solved under all circumstances. This leads to the requirement to adjust the discretisation of the momentum equations when there is significant flow curvature. The changes are presented in this study both when the position of the flow axis is known prior to the simulation and when its position is known only as a result of the simulation, this being the case when there is more than one source of swirling flow.\r\n\r\nThese original features contribute to a Computational Fluid Dynamics code which is capable of solving swirling, turbulent fluid flow and reactive, radiative heat transfer\r\non highly complex geometries. Specifically the techniques are applied to the simulation of processes occurring in the direct smelting of iron.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Finite Volume method makes it relatively easy to employ many techniques and physical models developed for structured codes.

The system is capable of learning new emotion labels and associated face actions for use in subsequent\r\ninterpretations.\r\n\r\nA prototype system has been developed on a SUN 2/MJN/120 system using POPLOG.V alidation studies suggest that the interpretations offered by Janus are generally consistent with those of human expert.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kearney, Garrett Donough Anthony"],"dc:date":"1991-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":997930,"sim:weight":0.493702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999550,"sim:weight":0.458815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":938775,"sim:weight":0.456166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2680157,"sim:weight":0.45175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.427771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2698381,"sim:weight":0.42564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":898421,"sim:weight":0.420939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":958678,"sim:weight":0.409268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":917515,"sim:weight":0.406086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1135756,"sim:weight":0.402099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109060,"sim:weight":0.382585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.36192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4181756,"sim:weight":0.360868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5850670,"sim:weight":0.357728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70583,"sim:weight":0.35084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631627,"sim:weight":0.349518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2700639,"sim:weight":0.345091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":865393,"sim:weight":0.337687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":757081,"sim:weight":0.332258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397707,"sim:weight":0.32543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This was accomplished by focusing on thetown of Bromley, Kent, which historians and modern commentators alike havechampioned as the archetypal middle-class suburb. \r\n\r\nThe thesis begins with an in-depth examination of the origins, ideals and actions of the small group of individuals who, in 1840, owned between them the\r\nmajority of land in the town. Findings about the local gentry challenge existing theories about landowners\u0027 alleged antipathy towards commercial interests and show\r\nthat landowners were not averse to exploiting prevailing economic conditions to their own financial gain.\r\n\r\nGradually the local gentry\u0027s \u0027social\u0027 power and influence was surrendered to the middle classes which were gaining in wealth and self-confidence. Even though the socio-economic composition of the local middle class was increasingly diverse, there existed no conspicuous divergence in their aspirations or intentions. Indeed, unity of purpose intensified their impact upon the social and economic life of the community, as well as upon prevailing ideals.\r\n\r\nAn ever-growing influx of commuters residing in the town, notably affluent financiers, merchants and professionals working in the City of London, occasionally challenged this unity over demands for improvements in facilities for urban - or suburban - living. However, in the long run these wealthy commuters were adopted as the \u0027new\u0027 elite of local society, helping to promote deferential and paternalistic relationships in a class that was drawn together within a complex web of social, cultural and economic ties. \r\n\r\nWhilst social harmony was secured by such ties, an obsession with image and perceived status helped preserve social ranks and social distinctions, of which geographical segregation became the most overt illustration. Such were the middle classes\u0027 fears of social degradation that they raised a united defence against the emergence of radicalism and socialism. This helped Bromley to emerge, or to be seen\r\nto emerge, as the most middle-class of English suburbs, even though this misjudges its more complex Victorian and Edwardian past.","bibo:AuthorList":["Greenhalgh, Matthew"],"dc:date":"1995","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.648166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352209,"sim:weight":0.606138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106765,"sim:weight":0.601838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.596786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383591,"sim:weight":0.563533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44417,"sim:weight":0.550896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94955,"sim:weight":0.542194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43891,"sim:weight":0.540329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108340,"sim:weight":0.539623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108654,"sim:weight":0.537505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108600,"sim:weight":0.535155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46839,"sim:weight":0.534998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45890,"sim:weight":0.534547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108171,"sim:weight":0.530552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98616,"sim:weight":0.527375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43340,"sim:weight":0.525624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77261,"sim:weight":0.524908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316129,"sim:weight":0.516468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381986,"sim:weight":0.516214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382003,"sim:weight":0.511489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Sociologists have reacted against this dominant paradigm by developing labelling theory accounts of how individuals and state agencies can create and maintain the category of handicap by stigniatization and differential denial of social resources, and there have been attempts to see the category as a functional one for industrial societies. \r\n\r\nHowever, these ahistorical accounts do not add up to an adequate sociology of retardation. Tracing the history of the condition, as the core of this thesis does, we find that it was not identified as a distinct \u0027social problem\u0027 in the West until the development of industrial capitalism. The key event appears to be the introduction of compulsory education, which presented to a state committed to universal education a group of children. \r\n\r\nThe reactions to this discovery, however, must be construed as part of a whole culture and ideology, and the thesis traces the parallel development of scientific conceptualistions, popular attitudes and treatment provisions in the light of economic relations. (The historical analysis necessarily confounds industrialisation with the growth of capitalism, but limited cross-cultural material suggests the latter as the crucial variable.) The main aim of the thesis is to illustrate the importance of history for sociological theory.\r\n\r\nThe thesis also considers the necessary role of microsociology and psychology in building a social theory of mental handicap which accounts for the experience of individuals aswell as the structures of society, and Chapter 7 describes three studies illustrative of what could be done. However, microsociology cannot provide a sociological understanding without a historically informed macro-sociology within which to locate it.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abbott, Pamela Ann"],"dc:date":"1982-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48318,"sim:weight":0.540701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3181,"sim:weight":0.523016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91645,"sim:weight":0.520859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145170,"sim:weight":0.500533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5349,"sim:weight":0.480935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316123,"sim:weight":0.467878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":922073,"sim:weight":0.461846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.458143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764194,"sim:weight":0.447953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.446434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43473,"sim:weight":0.445855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":947087,"sim:weight":0.444734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76703,"sim:weight":0.442099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387374,"sim:weight":0.441092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.438895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81349,"sim:weight":0.430667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108762,"sim:weight":0.427911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":731367,"sim:weight":0.42605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.425419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83326,"sim:weight":0.422202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Yet although given a pivotal\r\nposition in the women\u0027s movement, it and its organisation have received scant attention. \r\n\r\nThis thesis examines the origins of this petition, which was organised by members of the Kensington Society (1865-1868). It investigates the members of this society, and those 1,499 women who signed the petition. This thesis looks in detail at these women both statistically and, in so far as it is ever possible, in terms of the \u0027experience\u0027 of the individuals involved. The thesis uses information from census, directories, etc. as well as biographical resources, in a variety of ways, ranging from \u0027life histories\u0027 of sample rank and file individuals, to statistical data covering several hundred women, and including charts which explore the activities of individual women over time, and case studies of groups of up to fifly women. \r\n\r\nFollowing the Introductory chapter, Chapter Two presents the context for change within which the Kensington Society and the petition came into being. Chapter Three introduces some rank and file women, and looks at the role of older women. Chapter Four considers the Kensington Society, and the part its members played in collecting the signatures for the petition in 1866 and looks at the age, marital status, class and geographical distribution of both Kensington Society members and those women who signed this petition. Chapter Five explores shared experience, and Chapter Six shared\r\ncommitment Chapter Seven considers the implications of this investigation for the history of the early campaigns for women\u0027s suffrage in Britain.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dingsdale, Ann"],"dc:date":"1995-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383584,"sim:weight":0.712601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108695,"sim:weight":0.683339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43950,"sim:weight":0.653442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316067,"sim:weight":0.649562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45867,"sim:weight":0.645584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":315976,"sim:weight":0.63105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43822,"sim:weight":0.625576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108999,"sim:weight":0.615855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82889,"sim:weight":0.613026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45890,"sim:weight":0.609967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":37,"sim:weight":0.608505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108988,"sim:weight":0.601859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387175,"sim:weight":0.582712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2916,"sim:weight":0.582223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145652,"sim:weight":0.580688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381986,"sim:weight":0.554159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44671,"sim:weight":0.544132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223473,"sim:weight":0.532379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108351,"sim:weight":0.526684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316073,"sim:weight":0.522628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Indisputably, there are many ways of using technology to support students’ learning which enables them to manage the pace, time and place of their learning. Technology enhanced learning (TEL) can place students at the centre of the learning process, but this means that students need to take more responsibility for their learning. The literature refers to this as self-directed and self-regulated learning (Liu, Gomez, Khan and Yen, 2007; Nicol, 2006). Students can take more control over their learning and develop leadership of their own ‘learning curve’. Self-directed learning includes management of the learning materials, monitoring learning progress and regulating cognitive learning styles. However, this requires students to develop metacognitive strategies so they can identify their own learning styles in the appropriate formal and informal learning situations. This paper aims to investigate the impact of students’ metacognitive awareness on their learning outcomes within technology enhanced learning environments and concludes that the design of a TEL environment and the development of students’ metacognitive skills have a direct bearing on learning performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cemal Nat, Muesser","Walker, Simon","Bacon, Liz","Dastbaz, Mohammad","Flynn, Ryan"],"dc:date":"2011-04-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48380,"sim:weight":0.635839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341327,"sim:weight":0.630561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105141,"sim:weight":0.629504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109263,"sim:weight":0.600219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106722,"sim:weight":0.600118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109262,"sim:weight":0.5998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5160,"sim:weight":0.595792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.591367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85720,"sim:weight":0.57085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83543,"sim:weight":0.567407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14319,"sim:weight":0.553225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.543465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931015,"sim:weight":0.540701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.516024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.515726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.501647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.498131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.495817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10755,"sim:weight":0.491896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Since it models the human brain, communication as well as memory are of high importance for this VLSI architecture.","bibo:AuthorList":["Melis, W.J.C.","Chizuwa, S.","Kameyama, M."],"dc:date":"2009-05-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.196574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43146,"sim:weight":0.195074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.184714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932710,"sim:weight":0.184235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931240,"sim:weight":0.180805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146008,"sim:weight":0.174677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.171121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43180,"sim:weight":0.170516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931598,"sim:weight":0.160528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997932,"sim:weight":0.159298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.157941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12338,"sim:weight":0.154824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930696,"sim:weight":0.154172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998433,"sim:weight":0.153069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43550,"sim:weight":0.153023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386709,"sim:weight":0.152031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931552,"sim:weight":0.15183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.149975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101444,"sim:weight":0.149901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44505,"sim:weight":0.148038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Previous studies have concentrated on institutional and professional contexts, on informed medical opinion for example, or on focused studies of local practices.\r\nHere a wider range of opinion and practice is sought. The Introduction includes a discussion of nomenclature, and explains why \u0027intellectual impairment\u0027 is used rather\r\nthan the familiar term \u0027learning disability\u0027.\r\n\r\nPart I of the thesis explores perceptions of, and responses to, intellectual impairment held by different people in various contexts, while Part II employs biographical methods to examine the life histories of a number of intellectually impaired people in their familial setting. Part I starts with the views of professionals - educationists,doctors (who were at the forefront of the well documented emergence of idiot education in the 1840s) and also charity workers. Concentrating on previously neglected issues, the thesis shows that educational theory and practice offered nothing to families with an intellectually impaired child, and medical dominance had negligible competition. In a chapter on the efforts of charity workers as well as doctors to promote and raise money for the new idiot asylums, the focus is on the notion of idiocy that they put forward. Here ideas from the past mingled with new ideas. The question of the nature and origin of the image, or images, of the idiot is\r\ncontinued in two chapters that explore the varied and changing portrayals of intellectual impairment in imaginative literature.\r\n\r\nPart II uses family papers in a novel way to investigate the lives of individuals who had an intellectual impairment, and the responses of their families. These families, well known because of at least one eminent member, and well documented, are at the least, comfortably off. But within these parameters there is variation. Augustus, son of William and Caroline Lamb, is from the aristocracy, while Laura, daughter of Leslie Stephen of DNB fame, is from the middle class intelligentsia. This makes the similarity of responses to an intellectually impaired child the more interesting. For the most part, a child\u0027s difficulty was conceptualised as an educational, health or social problem, and not in terms of idiocy or a related all inclusive notion. The final chapter of Part II, that explores experiences of the modestly off or the poor, uses, in the absence of family papers, other sources of information. The inclusion of both the familial and private, and the public, contexts enables this thesis to reveal a wider range of perceptions and practices in relation to intellectual impairment during the\r\nperiod than have previous studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dickinson, Hilary"],"dc:date":"2000-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108503,"sim:weight":0.669586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631921,"sim:weight":0.652945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269948,"sim:weight":0.648398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108999,"sim:weight":0.644285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43177,"sim:weight":0.627275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381972,"sim:weight":0.624642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108780,"sim:weight":0.624178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108313,"sim:weight":0.62294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44896,"sim:weight":0.622694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666433,"sim:weight":0.616817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381986,"sim:weight":0.61569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108351,"sim:weight":0.608883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108988,"sim:weight":0.605835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4415,"sim:weight":0.603761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108800,"sim:weight":0.600231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664600,"sim:weight":0.593325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86167,"sim:weight":0.591473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81320,"sim:weight":0.588065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108600,"sim:weight":0.581201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383850,"sim:weight":0.579948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The ways in which ideas about race superiority interacted with class superiority in the formation of middle class values are also discussed as is the contemporary perception of working class and ethnic minority cultures. The cultural gap between the social classes is highlighted as are the forms of surveillance including disguise, which were undertaken in order to gain\r\nknowledge of working class life. \r\n\r\nPart Two looks at clubs in relation to the concerns discussed in Part One. Chapter Six (and the Appendix) survey the provision of clubs in London. Chapters Seven, Eight and Nine examine the clubs under the overlapping themes of protection, discipline and empowerment. The nature of this empowerment is examined in the context of the dominant ideology of married motherhood. \r\n\r\nDrawing on little-used club records and oral evidence, the thesis suggests that the clubs were part of a middle class initiative which aimed to re-make working class culture. The interaction between the club organizers and members is examined and it is suggested that a straightforward imposition of middle class values was not possible as a variety of factors were operating.

The first is concerned with re-examining the relationship between \u0027ordinary\u0027 and \u0027special\u0027 education in the light of developments in thinking and practice over the past decade. A case study approach was used to explore the limits and limitations of the thesis that \u0027special educational needs\u0027 can be most effectively addressed as part of a process of general curriculum critique and development designed to benefit all children. Pursuing questions and concerns arising from my own experience as a support teacher, the aim of the research was to establish if there is still a place for a concept of \u0027special\u0027 education consistent with this interpretation of the task and, if so, on what basis a distinction might now legitimately be made.\r\n\r\nIndividual children\u0027s responses to a particular instance of general curriculum development (in the teaching and learning of writing) were observed, and samples of their writing collected, over a period of several months. The analysis of this material highlighted the need for, and the means to articulate, a discourse and interpretive procedure for responding to concerns about individual children\u0027s learning which reflect and enact the critique of \u0027learning difficulties\u0027 understood as an individual problem. Having reformulated the original thesis to include an individual dimension, the study concludes that what is needed to resolve the questions raised initially is not, after all, a new distinction between \u0027ordinary\u0027 and \u0027special\u0027 education, but a distinction of a quite different order: one which draws attention to different kinds of professional thinking, and highlights the critical and innovative nature of the thinking required.\r\n\r\nThe second, subsidiary theme is a methodological one. It explores what the study itself may have to contribute to the establishment of a mode of research derived from teaching. Claiming to use no \u0027methods\u0027 other than the interpretive resources and experience of a teacher, the study uses its own processes to explore and establish its methodological status, and in particular to consider the significance of prior experience in the development of new knowledge about education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hart, Susan"],"dc:date":"1994-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108223,"sim:weight":0.732704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3222,"sim:weight":0.718498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.682041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.665386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.634919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9029759,"sim:weight":0.633957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108805,"sim:weight":0.610821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.604478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108361,"sim:weight":0.591408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382006,"sim:weight":0.590621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.573162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82653,"sim:weight":0.557405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.556931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666433,"sim:weight":0.553437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381972,"sim:weight":0.537603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309313,"sim:weight":0.535839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46776,"sim:weight":0.53348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43717,"sim:weight":0.529174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.526291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108863,"sim:weight":0.521028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Firstly, these new abilities will make it possible to detect validation issues at design time,\r\nthus reducing the likelihood of problems and increasing the ease of detecting them. Secondly, it will be possible for programs to be automatically composed from existing elements, thus further reducing the cost of validation issues.

It was the non-academic working class girl who was most disadvantaged by those divisions and who has been most ignored by educational policymakers and, indeed, by historians. That disadvantage was most apparent in the debate about vocational training for paid employment which marked these years. The controversy between the proponents of liberal and vocational education was of special significance for girls because of the frequently expressed argument that a girl had a single vocation - homemaking and domesticity. As the economy was restructured and women were drawn into the new consumer industries, the crucial dilemma of whether education should enable girls to enlarge their opportunities in paid employment or whether it should continue to orientate girls towards the domestic role had to be addressed. It is the educational policy and practices resulting from that tension between domesticity and productivity which this thesis will examine. \r\n\r\nIts focus will be the elementary and technical schools of London. The London County Council adopted a consciously progressive technical education programme during the inter-war years. This local study will therefore elucidate trends in the policy, practice and experience of girls\u0027 vocational schooling. It will be suggested that policy reflected the coexistence of patriarchy and capitalism. Class intersected with gender to result in a situation where schools trained girls to be cheap, unskilled workers in certain women\u0027s trades. Educational policy was constrained by the desire to preserve conventional domestic roles intact and a belief that working class girls could be defmed by their gender as a homogeneous group undistinguished by aptitude or ability. The assumption was made that girls would engage only temporarily in paid employment before returning to their true vocations as wives and mothers. Thus vocational schooling provides a concrete expression of inter-war gender ideology.\r\n\r\nThe Introduction sets out the theoretical framework upon which this thesis is based. Chapter Two will provide an examination of the political, economic and social context in\r\nwhich educational policy was made. The third chapter analyses domestic studies\u0027 courses, the most explicit formulation of how schools prepared girls for their adult role. Chapters Four and Five focus on the Junior Technical and Central Schools, illustrating how schooling within them epitomised assumptions, prejudices and ideologies about girls\u0027 education during the inter-war years.","bibo:AuthorList":["King, Sarah Jane"],"dc:date":"1994-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316125,"sim:weight":0.646981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780220,"sim:weight":0.621278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.610327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2916,"sim:weight":0.60707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145621,"sim:weight":0.60556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18050,"sim:weight":0.580278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17898,"sim:weight":0.579587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44671,"sim:weight":0.567423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44423,"sim:weight":0.558767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.5503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381912,"sim:weight":0.545347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930312,"sim:weight":0.54359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101495,"sim:weight":0.539562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77678,"sim:weight":0.531021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631633,"sim:weight":0.529489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383584,"sim:weight":0.528449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108584,"sim:weight":0.525154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383341,"sim:weight":0.524611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43950,"sim:weight":0.51691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316094,"sim:weight":0.516468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Literature review on general theoretical framework on corporate governance and on the role of NEDs shows that there is a paradoxical compliance, that is the implementation of the statutory and non-statutory codes on corporate governance to minimise the corporate governance problems such as exploitation of the assets of shareholders by the management, corporate collapses, accounting frauds and so on yet the same problems emerging again and again. Therefore, the re-examination of the role of NEDs was identified as the intellectual problem for this thesis.\r\n\r\nA review into the existing research methodologies and research methods led to understand the need to design a research methodology for replication in the same research context or another research context to ensure reliability and validity of the research methodology and methods selected. Two research methods were chosen to collect data that is content analysis and postal questionnaire survey. The main  theoretical framework used in this research is the Role Theory.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to understand the role of the NEDs in the context of the implementation of the non-regulatory Codes on Corporate Governance. The aim is to design the research methodology only after making a review into the strengths and weaknesses of the existing research methodologies into the role of the NEDs. The objective is to execute the same with a view to identify a model on the role of NEDs useful for the corporate sector in Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\nThesis argues the rational of explaining the role of the NEDs in several categories such as strategy, advice, monitoring and service in previous research. This research finds a multiple number of tasks of NEDs as well as diversity among the tasks. Further it argues that the role of NEDs is conditioned by the expectations of the stakeholders as well as with their own cognitive disposition.\r\n\r\nThesis contributes to knowledge in number of ways namely: (1) role of NEDs in AIM companies, (2) a review of general theoretical framework on corporate governance in the context of the implementation of non-regulatory codes on corporate governance, (3) a review of corporate governance experience in Sri Lanka and (4) some methodological developments for the content analysis technique namely use of Chi square test statistics to prove the protection of two properties of content analysis that is mutual exhaustiveness and mutual exclusiveness.\r\n\r\nSubject to several limitations arising from the inherent weaknesses in sampling and data collection, thesis certainly makes a contribution to understand the role of the NEDs in the modern corporation as well as to design a model on the role of NEDs in Sri Lanka which is planning to implement a non-regulatory code on corporate governance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gunetilleke, Halpege Walter"],"dc:date":"2009-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5087431,"sim:weight":0.669746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.657705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101265,"sim:weight":0.655971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":836138,"sim:weight":0.636915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1057858,"sim:weight":0.631687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":861642,"sim:weight":0.631634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":859598,"sim:weight":0.628552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51102,"sim:weight":0.626185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98926,"sim:weight":0.614295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43805,"sim:weight":0.609112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1059864,"sim:weight":0.608334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48282,"sim:weight":0.591365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47250,"sim:weight":0.58811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1095806,"sim:weight":0.577489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5835858,"sim:weight":0.577192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":756165,"sim:weight":0.574844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":892100,"sim:weight":0.569521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":600666,"sim:weight":0.568214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108921,"sim:weight":0.566434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48327,"sim:weight":0.563165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The primary outcome measure was a reduction in drug therapy problems (DTPs) with a 64% resolution observed in the active group compared to only 3% in the control group over the six month period of the study. The effect size was significant (p\u003c0.0001) with an absolute risk reduction of 61% and a number needed to treat of 1.6. This means for every 16 DTPs receiving an intervention, 10 DTPs would be resolved over and above standard care at 6 months. There were no significant differences in secondary outcome measures (number of repeat medicines and use of health services) between the two groups. \r\n\r\nA focus group of 6 patients not involved in the main study confirmed that MUR was well received by patients with overarching themes of awareness and trust. In addition a semi-structured questionnaire completed by 72 study participants confirmed that MUR was well received by patients.\r\n\r\nTwo further focus groups of 6 pharmacists (providers and non-providers of MUR) were also conducted which raised contrasting views regarding the New Pharmacy Contract but showed an overwhelming consensus between both groups that MUR was a beneficial service. \r\n\r\nOn the basis of these results, one can conclude that the hypothesis \u0027MUR will reduce drug therapy problems and will be well accepted by both patients and pharmacists\u0027 can be accepted. These findings make an original contribution to the literature and represent a significant contribution to the evidence base in support of MUR services.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mohammad, Abdul-Wahid"],"dc:date":"2008-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.566014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185982,"sim:weight":0.558504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999080,"sim:weight":0.51549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111794,"sim:weight":0.498222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5776465,"sim:weight":0.482825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43609,"sim:weight":0.464621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106914,"sim:weight":0.463428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1094520,"sim:weight":0.459287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111804,"sim:weight":0.456407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1117848,"sim:weight":0.443715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99724,"sim:weight":0.436229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1143354,"sim:weight":0.426316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.423873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48362,"sim:weight":0.422501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101219,"sim:weight":0.418278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":722380,"sim:weight":0.414062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43505,"sim:weight":0.397838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":725582,"sim:weight":0.395077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44980,"sim:weight":0.391938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99101,"sim:weight":0.385098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Employing a knowledge-capital model, this study finds that joint national incomes, per capita difference, investment liberalisation and the cost of exporting to Turkey have significant effects on FDI in Turkey. In addition, the prospect of European Union membership, government stability, infrastructure, bilateral exchange rate, exchange rate volatility and openness to trade play an important role in determining the amount of FDI in Turkey. Moreover, this study finds that high relative unit labour costs and corruption provide stimuli to FDI.\r\n\r\nUsing an augmented gravity model to investigate the relationship between FDI and imports, this study finds that outward FDI stocks are positively related to the exports. Overall, the empirical results indicate that FDI in Turkey is mainly motivated by market access and sensitive to the quality of institutions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Esiyok, Bulent"],"dc:date":"2010-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108919,"sim:weight":0.813305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":398057,"sim:weight":0.797047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3102434,"sim:weight":0.794781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5084094,"sim:weight":0.775389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93266,"sim:weight":0.774464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1001677,"sim:weight":0.758597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99318,"sim:weight":0.7494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75852,"sim:weight":0.744398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1001675,"sim:weight":0.741301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5084084,"sim:weight":0.738601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":755985,"sim:weight":0.734594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930801,"sim:weight":0.733843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2680104,"sim:weight":0.728112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133599,"sim:weight":0.719178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5080106,"sim:weight":0.697802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94671,"sim:weight":0.690069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":876444,"sim:weight":0.686001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98914,"sim:weight":0.68095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":853446,"sim:weight":0.669596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3126316,"sim:weight":0.667544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To add an extra dimension to the assessment we involved final year Law students from the School of Humanities, Law Department, to act as jury members and also to help to cross-examine the postgraduate students while they presented their findings in the role of an Expert Witness. This created at the same time a valuable exercise for the legal students in the context that evidence presented in courts is increasingly computer-based evidence.

These difficulties also meet the American Psychiatric Association diagnostic criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The British Psychological Society has adopted the term ‘bio-psycho-social’ to reflect the complex and multi-dimensional nature of ADHD. \r\n\r\nIn young people, these symptoms interfere with learning, interpersonal relationships and self-esteem and can lead to social and educational exclusion. The use of drugs in the treatment of ADHD remains controversial and according to the 2005 prescription cost analysis (Cohen, 2006), Ritalin use has risen by 7600 per cent. Unfortunately, since the move away from the medical model following the 1978 Warnock Report on supporting children with special needs, a mindset has been created amongst teachers regarding the identification and assessment of children with certain types of complex needs as being outside of their expertise and this has resulted in teachers placing an over-reliance on external support services and specialists. \r\n\r\nThis thesis proposes an enhancement to the existing over-complicated and bureaucratic system of identification and support for behavioural, social and emotional difficulties (BESD)/ADHD that develops the expertise and the role of the SENCO and thus streamlines identification of individual need and enhances educational support for ADHD sufferers. This research thesis used a case study approach with an interpretive dimension to enable the researcher to enter the working world of doctors and other medical professionals, teachers and classroom support assistants, and children as the ultimate subjects of this enquiry. The purpose of the study was to extend my knowledge of a complex childhood phenomenon and to examine the systems put in place in schools and support services that identify certain SEN and disorders that affect learning. An analysis of the role of teachers and school special needs coordinators was explored along with government policy on inclusion practices. The role of professionals from medicine and education in LEA support services was also examined and reported. A total of eighteen questionnaires were used to target key personnel in LEA support services. This was followed up with interviews at support services and in schools. A total of six medical professionals and a further nine educational professionals were interviewed. Three classroom observations were also conducted at a London comprehensive school. \r\n\r\nAnalysis of the resulting data led to the identification of a series of Figures and a flowchart depicting the ‘story’ of this difficult process, with a proposed enhancement for earlier BSED/ADHD identification and support, and a range of recommendations. Although this was a small-scale research study, the literature and the comments from professionals cited from the national expert SENCO Forum indicate that my findings reflect a much wider picture locally and nationally.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, Robert"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5067497,"sim:weight":0.757615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98985,"sim:weight":0.749343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5067423,"sim:weight":0.745404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98868,"sim:weight":0.742572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48326,"sim:weight":0.731411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5067156,"sim:weight":0.71834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5066422,"sim:weight":0.714128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5067334,"sim:weight":0.706402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24365,"sim:weight":0.697032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50139,"sim:weight":0.690427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":746630,"sim:weight":0.683069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5066818,"sim:weight":0.667108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":985742,"sim:weight":0.623551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.605706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5065578,"sim:weight":0.598089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1040380,"sim:weight":0.580713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8794271,"sim:weight":0.577781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309166,"sim:weight":0.568175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5851498,"sim:weight":0.567625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101445,"sim:weight":0.555754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This thesis reports the outcome of research undertaken to develop a system to describe and test scheduling rules against a set of scheduling data. The overall intention of the research was to reduce commercial scheduling costs by minimizing human domain expert interaction within the scheduling process. \r\n\r\nThis thesis reports the outcome of research initiated following a consultancy project to develop a system to test driver schedules against the legal driving rules in force in the UK and the EU. One of the greatest challenges faced was interpreting the driving rules and translating them into the chosen programming language. This part of the project took considerable effort to complete the programming, testing and debugging processes. A potential problem then arises if the Department of Transport or the European Union alter or change the driving rules. Considerable software development is likely to be required to support the new rule set. \r\n\r\nThe approach considered takes into account the need for a modular software component that can be used in not just transport scheduling systems which look at legal driving rules but may also be integrated into other systems that have the need to test temporal rules. The integration of the rule testing component into existing systems is key to making the proposed solution reusable. \r\n\r\nThe research outcome proposes an alternative approach to rule definition, similar to that of RuleML, but with the addition of rule metadata to provide the ability of describing rules of a temporal nature. The rules can be serialised and deserialised between XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and objects within an object oriented environment (in this case .NET with C#), to provide a means of transmission of the rules over a communication infrastructure. The rule objects can then be compiled into an executable software library, allowing the rules to be tested more rapidly than traditional interpreted rules. Additional support functionality is also defined to provide a means of effectively integrating the rule testing engine into existing applications. \r\n\r\nFollowing the construction of a rule testing engine that has been designed to meet the given requirements, a series of tests were undertaken to determine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This lead to the implementation of improvements in the caching of constructed work plans to further improve performance. Tests were also carried out into the application of the proposed solution within alternative scheduling domains and to analyse the difference in computational performance and memory usage across system architectures, software frameworks and operating systems, with the support of Mono. \r\n\r\nFuture work that is expected to follow on from this thesis will likely reside in investigations into the development of graphical design tools for the creation of the rules, improvements in the work plan construction algorithm, parallelisation of elements of the process to take better advantage of multi-core processors and off-loading of the rule testing process onto dedicated or generic computational processors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wetherall, Jodie"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.414134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45738,"sim:weight":0.408673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.389976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145551,"sim:weight":0.382275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929818,"sim:weight":0.374538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.369911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.369911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.369911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.369911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.369911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.369911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.369911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.369911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.369911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.369911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.369911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.369911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.369911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.369911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.361135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The work of scholars including N. Katherine Hayles, Martha A. Turner has applied Thomas S. Kuhn’s notion of scientific paradigms to literary works, especially those of the Victorian period. There seemed to be an absence, however, of research of a similar academic standard exploring the relationship between scientific worldviews and detective fiction. Extending their scholarship, this thesis seeks to open up debate in what was perceived to be an under-represented area of literary study.\r\n\r\nThe thesis begins by identifying the main precepts of the three paradigms. It then offers a chronological overview of the developing relationship between these precepts and detective fiction from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Sign of Four (1890) to P.D.James’s The Black Tower (1975). The present state of this interaction is assessed through a detailed analysis of representative examples of the detective fiction of Reginald Hill, Barbara Nadel, and Quintin Jardine written between 1980 and 2010.\r\n\r\nThe thesis concludes that by presenting the interrelatedness characteristic of the holistic paradigm in a positive light, the work of Hill, Nadel and Jardine may facilitate a paradigm shift away from the dominant Newtonian paradigm towards a more holistic worldview. Further, contemporary detective fiction may have an important role to play in acclimatising its readership to a more inclusive worldview.\r\n\r\nThis research identifies several areas for future study. It would be interesting to extend this work to take account of detective fiction from other cultures. It would also be fascinating to investigate the relationship between structure (of both the narrative and the plot) and scientific pattern in order to assess just how far scientific concepts and detective fiction are interconnected.","bibo:AuthorList":["Goldsmith, Hilary Anne"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109060,"sim:weight":0.597083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.59543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384208,"sim:weight":0.587668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.542604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.541657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779646,"sim:weight":0.508919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631627,"sim:weight":0.506712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999701,"sim:weight":0.505105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710215,"sim:weight":0.495023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43613,"sim:weight":0.479937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77760,"sim:weight":0.477993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382037,"sim:weight":0.47627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666433,"sim:weight":0.463698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15201,"sim:weight":0.459356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108661,"sim:weight":0.459306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85200,"sim:weight":0.444129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49926,"sim:weight":0.443424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108355,"sim:weight":0.439917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108504,"sim:weight":0.436098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.429953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Processing instruction is a type of focus on form which is framed around the input processing theoretical framework. In order to carry out this investigation two separate experimental studies were conducted. All participants were native English speakers and were randomly assigned to two groups. In both experimental studies, one group received processing instruction which involved an explicit instruction component and structured input practice directed at altering the way L2 learners process input; the other group was used as a control group and received no instruction. Interpretation and production sentence level tasks, and discourse level tasks were used to measure performance after a one day instruction. A pre-test/post-test design was adopted to collect data in both studies. In the second experimental study, the processing instruction group received a re-exposure treatment between the post-test and the delayed post-test.\r\n\r\nBased on previous research carried out on the effectiveness of processing instruction, it was hypothesised that processing instruction would have positive effects on the accuracy with which subjects interpreted and produced sentences containing Japanese passive forms.\r\nA further hypothesis was that the effects of re-exposure to the processing instruction treatment (after the first post-test) would further improve subjects ability to interpret and produce sentences containing Japanese passive forms. \r\n\r\nA set of two hypotheses were formulated on possible interpretation discourse effects for processing instruction. It was hypothesised that the group receiving processing instruction would improve in its ability to interpret discourse (guided recall: dialogue and story version) containing Japanese passive forms, and that learners in this group, receiving re-exposure to the processing instruction treatment would further improve in their ability to interpret discourse containing Japanese passive forms.\r\n\r\nOverall the statistical analyses carried out on the raw scores of all the measures used supported the four hypotheses of this study. The results obtained in this research provide clear evidence that processing instruction has positive effects on the acquisition of Japanese passive construction. The present study showed that processing instruction was successful in altering the way in which learners processed the input and its effects had also an impact on the way learners produced Japanese passive construction forms. The main findings of the present study also provided new evidence on the effectiveness of processing instruction in improving learners’ performance on interpretation discourse level tasks. In addition to this, it also provides new evidence that learners receiving re-exposure to the processing instruction treatment between a post-test and a delayed post-test can further improve in their ability to interpret and produce the target feature at sentence level and interpret the target feature at discourse level.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained in the two studies have implications at two levels. At the theoretical level this research provides further support for the role that input processing plays in SLA. At the pedagogical level it demonstrates the effectiveness of processing instruction on the acquisition of a different linguistic feature of the Japanese grammar system (passive forms), not only on an interpretation and production sentence level task but also on an interpretation discourse level task. It also demonstrated the important role of a re-exposure instructional treatment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hikima, Noriko"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43642,"sim:weight":0.481524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108337,"sim:weight":0.353609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46816,"sim:weight":0.352055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187964,"sim:weight":0.344403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573546,"sim:weight":0.33799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108290,"sim:weight":0.308152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17863,"sim:weight":0.30774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99145,"sim:weight":0.299764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99358,"sim:weight":0.297073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.297029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17914,"sim:weight":0.296424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.296371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108961,"sim:weight":0.293455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108297,"sim:weight":0.293031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98933,"sim:weight":0.28623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108341,"sim:weight":0.283357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8313,"sim:weight":0.282261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4188002,"sim:weight":0.281764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47373,"sim:weight":0.280929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.274572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recently, the professionalisation of the role of the TA may have created a ‘teacher-in-waiting’ (Neill, 2002) and thus the nature of the TA’s role in PE, and the ability of the specialist teacher to work collaboratively with them is complex. \r\n\r\nThis mixed methods study, inspired by critical ethnography (Thomas, 1993, 2003) incorporated five techniques of enquiry initially based on the work of Giangreco and Broer (2005). In keeping with a constructionist paradigm and integrating what I have termed a distorical  theoretical perspective, I counted the interaction between people and the social structure in which they operated as important (Crotty, 1998, Broido, 2002) and drew on dominant participant voices (Lincoln and Guba, 2003). Adopting a theoretical perspective grounded in disability studies, I explored the perceptions of the role of the TA in inclusive PE through qualitative and quantitative data and presented a role definition which combines the humanistic with the instructional (or professional) after Reiter, 2000. I argued whether responsibility for the child’s learning should be devolved through the TA. Do we use the TA to make the teacher’s life easier or to support, collaboratively, the inclusion of the disabled pupil?\r\n\r\nThe impact of this study on professional practice relates to the clarity of role definition for TAs generally and for TAs specifically who work in PE; the collaborative nature (or otherwise) of the TA/teacher relationship and the implications of these findings for the future training and deployment of teaching assistants in PE with a physically disabled pupil in a mainstream secondary school. This study found that TAs in PE share many traits or characteristics with those TAs working in other subject disciplines, or across subjects. However, in PE they were inclined to rate a willingness and ability to ‘join in’ and participate in practical activities alongside pupils above pedagogical knowledge. Training either reinforces an instructional or coaching role, or it focuses on the caring or medical aspects. The reality for the TA in this study however, is that they neither define themselves as one or the other but see themselves as drawing on their own skills, empathy and initiative to facilitate a positive, inclusive environment, with or without the input of the PE teacher. They deem themselves to be both care-givers where appropriate as well as supporters of autonomous participation (as opposed to learning). That the professionalization of their role moves them towards the pedagogical places the TA between a rock and a hard place.","bibo:AuthorList":["Farr, Jacqueline"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.653948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82614,"sim:weight":0.644959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76402,"sim:weight":0.620112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13991,"sim:weight":0.615191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.613208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":354678,"sim:weight":0.612517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5465,"sim:weight":0.579342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999565,"sim:weight":0.576851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309504,"sim:weight":0.575043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82335,"sim:weight":0.574064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77166,"sim:weight":0.563722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761107,"sim:weight":0.559726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76827,"sim:weight":0.548841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.541381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13256,"sim:weight":0.539667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14020,"sim:weight":0.537201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3566,"sim:weight":0.530542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.525868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2859,"sim:weight":0.50818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2428,"sim:weight":0.492353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this article, we have investigated an alternative separation technique based on liquid–liquid extraction called the reverse micellar extraction. We extracted MAb (IgG1) using reverse micelles of an anionic surfactant, sodium bis 2-ethyl-hexyl sulfosuccinate (AOT) and a combination of anionic (AOT) and nonionic surfactants (Brij-30, Tween-85, Span-85) using isooctane as the solvent system. The extraction efficiency of IgG1 was studied by varying parameters, such as pH of the aqueous phase, cation concentration, and type and surfactant concentration. Using the AOT/Isooctane reverse micellar system, we could achieve good overall extraction of IgG1 (between 80 and 90%), but only 30% of the bioactivity of IgG1 could be recovered at the end of the extraction by using its binding to affinity chromatography columns as a surrogate measure of activity. As anionic surfactants were suspected as being one of the reasons for the reduced activity, we decided to combine a nonionic surfactant with an anionic surfactant and then study its effect on the extraction efficiency and bioactivity. The best results were obtained using an AOT/Brij-30/Isooctane reverse micellar system, which gave an overall extraction above 90 and 59% overall activity recovery. An AOT/Tween-85/Isooctane reverse micellar system gave an overall extraction of between 75 and 80% and overall activity recovery of around 40–45%. The results showed that the activity recovery of IgG1 can be significantly enhanced using different surfactant combination systems, and if the recovery of IgG1 can be further enhanced, the technique shows considerable promise for the downstream purification of MAbs.","bibo:AuthorList":["George, Daliya A.","Stuckey, David C."],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43594,"sim:weight":0.216714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81375,"sim:weight":0.193167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108488,"sim:weight":0.175764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29432,"sim:weight":0.169139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109207,"sim:weight":0.1594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101231,"sim:weight":0.149565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85207,"sim:weight":0.149277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85877,"sim:weight":0.135081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.134154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44827,"sim:weight":0.128338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101519,"sim:weight":0.122899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387341,"sim:weight":0.118806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98529,"sim:weight":0.118497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27178,"sim:weight":0.118495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930889,"sim:weight":0.117889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108054,"sim:weight":0.117857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3158,"sim:weight":0.116463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335448,"sim:weight":0.104492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145774,"sim:weight":0.0999539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98648,"sim:weight":0.0901247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Within this paradigm, Britain fared poorly, as until and after the 1870s, most or many schools for the poor were funded by religious societies, notably the National Society and the BFSS,  akin to modern-day national charities,  The “discovery” by Philip Gardner in 1984 of  working class schooling  reinforced the view that National and British schools were avoided in favour of working class private schools. Yet this finding was not confirmed by the Newcastle Commission of 1858. \r\n\r\nThe”voluntary” schools have been characterised as intended agents of social control, with low standards and brutal discipline.  The questions raised by dissenters such as  Harold Silver, who questioned whether standards of discipline were brutal, and noted the diversity of inspectors’ reports, have not been pursued.  Yet in the English context, the parish was the unit of organisation of “the state” at local level, and for the dispensing of relief, especially before the New Poor law of 1836. From the 1690s onwards, schools, built as adjuncts to churches and chapels, became centres of parish life, places where welfare was dispensed,  locations for parish libraries as well as local entertainments.   \r\n\r\nThis paper will draw on the author’s case-study of two “commuter villages” on the outskirts of London, between 1740-1870, to call for a re-conceptualisation of the place of the voluntary school within parish life. Indubitably, there was a regional specificity about this location: near London, with opportunities for employment in crafts, trades and service as well as the metropolis. Nevertheless, as many studies have been located, either in areas of  heavy industry, or in rural areas, this  provides an opportunity for a contrasting perspective.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martin, Mary Clare"],"dc:date":"2011-06-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1145621,"sim:weight":0.346501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108171,"sim:weight":0.344007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316129,"sim:weight":0.313711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43473,"sim:weight":0.305584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.299525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46559,"sim:weight":0.29392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45371,"sim:weight":0.289372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777837,"sim:weight":0.279187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.277947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48367,"sim:weight":0.277831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84845,"sim:weight":0.27614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76703,"sim:weight":0.271246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6572,"sim:weight":0.268947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316094,"sim:weight":0.26702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45252,"sim:weight":0.266596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108584,"sim:weight":0.263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44140,"sim:weight":0.261758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.261296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383568,"sim:weight":0.261042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44575,"sim:weight":0.259921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

His work is a major piece of scholarship on an otherwise obscure precursor, with the most favorable appraisal he ever wrote of any economist. Georgescu suggested that Gossen was unjustly ignored by his contemporaries, just as he himself felt that his own contributions to economics were insufficiently recognized. His belief that he fully deserved the Nobel –which he never had– was one that he widely voiced among colleagues at Vanderbilt University.\r\nYet it was not only self-identification with a forgotten older writer that motivated Georgescu’s editorial enterprise: I show that his original plan was to work at an original approach to utility and consumer choice theory, inspired by suggestions he found in Gossen. To achieve this, I rely upon previously unused archival material to reconstitute the genesis and evolution of Georgescu’s work on Gossen, providing evidence that its completion took almost twenty years and was highly convoluted.

Five NSS questions explore students’ views of criteria, the fairness of assessment and marking, the promptness and detail of feedback received and whether it has helped to clarify their understanding.  In response to poor NSS results in these areas the Primary Education Department made alterations to practices to enhance the quality of its provision.  These appeared to have little impact on student satisfaction despite being based on tutors’ extensive working knowledge of Assessment for Learning (Black and Wiliam, 1998) in the schools’ sector.  It was evident that we needed to find out more about the student experience and to listen to the student voice.\r\n\r\nFollowing a successful bid for University of Greenwich Innovation Funding, we worked collaboratively with students to determine their perspective of feedback and assessment via three world café events (World Café, 2011), run for and by undergraduates during 2010.  Some 60 BA (QTS) in Primary Education students attended the events, discussed questions and wrote comments on tablecloths.  Student Ambassadors worked in liaison with a researcher to interpret and analyse the students’ perceptions and found they valued the one-to-one assessment and feedback received during placements far more than that received during the academic element of the programme. \r\n\r\nFindings were shared within the project team and used as a basis for developing two staff-student conferences focusing on assessment and feedback.  The first of these, in July 2010, disseminated findings and involved staff and students in making recommendations for practice.  The second, in September 2010, involved staff in reviewing all courses to action these recommendations.  Actions included the development and use of detailed marking criteria across teams of tutors to enable consistency of practice, overt reference to different types of feedback used within courses and analysis of assessment practices at programme level.   During 2010-11 the student ambassadors disseminated the project’s findings from the world café events and the department’s consequent actions, to all student cohorts.\r\n\r\nThis presentation, by staff and student members of the project team, will share processes, outcomes and responses and consider how such approaches could be used across disciplines.  The students’ perspective gave us greater insight, provoked joint action and led to improvements in the quality of the student experience.","bibo:AuthorList":["Headington, Rita","Callnon, Duncan","Barron, Hetty","Smith, Michael"],"dc:date":"2011-07-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2200,"sim:weight":0.541999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108108,"sim:weight":0.531477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930635,"sim:weight":0.448525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9631121,"sim:weight":0.434776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.429762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78564,"sim:weight":0.424461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.424185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709519,"sim:weight":0.424098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.398429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.392338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103137,"sim:weight":0.391601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99108,"sim:weight":0.382261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.381856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12367,"sim:weight":0.377728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.371276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.369425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77452,"sim:weight":0.367966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.366448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.362929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.362568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The emphasis will be on hydrodynamic aspects of the slag/steel interface\r\nbehaviour and in particular the effects of injected gas bubbles on interface stability. The model includes an improved implicit Counter Diffusion Method (CDM) interface-tracking scheme for numerical efficiency and a Lagrangian\r\nrepresentation of argon bubble tracks. In the water model, an oil layer is used to represent the slag. Qualitative\r\nevaluation of the results against water model visualizations explains the main flow patterns observed, and validates the predicted deformation of the meniscus. Quantitative comparison against LDA velocity measurements is provided at seven measurement positions and the nature of observed wave action is analyzed by its spectral pattern. The dominant frequencies measured are correlated against the turnover time of the top and bottom recirculation regions in the caster for various SEN casting velocities and gas flow rates. The effect of gas is seen to have an important influence on the flowfield in general, but also on interface behaviour and on the frequencies observed. This influence is also seen in the case of a real industrial continuous caster, where velocity measurements and simulations show a change in the steel velocity pattern from a “single roll” to a “double roll” as the relative amount of gas increases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kountouriotis, Z.","Pericleous, K.","Djambazov, G.","Domgin, J.F.","Gardin, P."],"dc:date":"2011-06-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1651854,"sim:weight":0.279752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43542,"sim:weight":0.270263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.264181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57514,"sim:weight":0.261836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102651,"sim:weight":0.261542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43189,"sim:weight":0.258365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98551,"sim:weight":0.256731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145185,"sim:weight":0.252426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26126,"sim:weight":0.241941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24022,"sim:weight":0.240751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48331,"sim:weight":0.238766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387317,"sim:weight":0.238127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57137,"sim:weight":0.235929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98555,"sim:weight":0.232884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387380,"sim:weight":0.228601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631471,"sim:weight":0.2222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101418,"sim:weight":0.219902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46104,"sim:weight":0.216905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269888,"sim:weight":0.215073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75482,"sim:weight":0.21426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A key part of the work for this project is considering the emotional and behavioural state of the trainees, and the creation of more realistic, and thereby stressful, representations of multimedia information to impact on the decision-making of those trainees. Existing training models are predominantly paper-based, table-top exercises, which require an exercise of imagination on the part of the trainees to consider not only the various aspects of a crisis situation but also the impacts of interventions, and remediating actions in the event of the failure of an intervention. However, existing computing models and tools are focused on supporting tactical and operational activities in crisis management, not strategic. Therefore, the PANDORA system will provide a rich multimedia information environment, to provide trainees with the detailed information they require to develop strategic plans to deal with a crisis scenario, and will then provide information on the impacts of the implementation of those plans and provide the opportunity for the trainees to revise and remediate those plans. Since this activity is invariably multi-agency, the training environment must support group-based strategic planning activities and trainees will occupy specific roles within the crisis scenario. The system will also provide a range of non-playing characters (NPC) representing domain experts, high-level controllers (e.g. politicians, ministers), low-level controllers (tactical and operational commanders), and missing trainee roles, to ensure a fully populated scenario can be realised in each instantiation. Within the environment, the emotional and behavioural state of the trainees will be monitored, and interventions, in the form of environmental information controls and mechanisms impacting on the stress levels and decisionmaking capabilities of the trainees, will be used to personalise the training environment. This approach enables a richer and more realistic representation of the crisis scenario to be enacted, leading to better strategic plans and providing trainees with structured feedback on their performance under stress.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bacon, Liz","Windall, Gillian","MacKinnon, Lachlan","Hawkridge, David","Ng, Kia","Verjans, Steven"],"dc:date":"2011-08-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.472292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.417748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.400904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.400892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.39026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.385367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.385367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.385367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.385367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.385367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.385367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.385367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.385367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.385367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.385367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.385367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.385367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.385367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.385367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.382401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In group-based microfinance, success in attaining these goals is crucially dependent on the sustainability of groups as organisations. This paper argues that as mounting tensions arise between financial sustainability and organisational sustainability, this produces fundamental instability within groups and a tendency for the system to collapse. What is more, tensions tend to lead to the fracturing of groups and greater exclusion of the poor, creating negative impacts on wellbeing. \r\n\r\nBased on original data collected during fieldwork in the rural communities of Cusco and semi-urban shantytowns of Lima, Peru, during 2000-2001, the study comprises a total sample of 480 individuals randomly selected from a Communal Banking programme called La Chanchita. Methods for collecting information included quantitative and qualitative tools such as surveys, in-depth interviews, focus groups and participatory observation, in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the internal dynamics of groups and to crosscheck information. Results and analysis were compared and contrasted with other similar organisations in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\r\n\r\nSome key questions are addressed in order to attempt to find alternatives for improvement: \r\n\r\n•\tHow can tensions between financial and organisational sustainability be minimised?\r\n•\tWhat types of incentive structures can be put in place to strengthen groups?\r\n•\tHow can different financial and non-financial services be combined to help attain the dual purpose of financial sustainability and poverty reduction?","bibo:AuthorList":["Marr, Ana"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631727,"sim:weight":0.431264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316086,"sim:weight":0.405967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77763,"sim:weight":0.26821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67390,"sim:weight":0.263533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.171038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5629,"sim:weight":0.166961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108207,"sim:weight":0.133889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.129384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767488,"sim:weight":0.128038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788824,"sim:weight":0.12605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15244,"sim:weight":0.12429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2783523,"sim:weight":0.122457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.119332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44471,"sim:weight":0.114456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.113939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.112916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.112261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85449,"sim:weight":0.107291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.10337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.103055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Three G. fuscipes subspecies have been described, primarily based upon subtle differences in the morphology of their genitalia. Here we describe a study conducted across the range of this important vector to determine whether molecular evidence generated from nuclear DNA (microsatellites and gene sequence information), mitochondrial DNA and symbiont DNA support the existence of these taxa as discrete taxonomic units.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Findings: The nuclear ribosomal Internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) provided support for the three subspecies. However nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data did not support the monophyly of the morphological subspecies G. f.fuscipes or G. f. quanzensis. Instead, the most strongly supported monophyletic group was comprised of flies sampled fromEthiopia. Maternally inherited loci (mtDNA and symbiont) also suggested monophyly of a group from Lake Victoria basin and Tanzania, but this group was not supported by nuclear loci, suggesting different histories of these markers. Microsatellite data confirmed strong structuring across the range of G. fuscipes s.l., and was useful for deriving the interrelationship of closely related populations.\r\n\r\nConclusion/Significance: We propose that the morphological classification alone is not used to classify populations of G. fuscipes for control purposes. The Ethiopian population, which is scheduled to be the target of a sterile insect release (SIT) programme, was notably discrete. From a programmatic perspective this may be both positive, given that it may reflect limited migration into the area or negative if the high levels of differentiation are also reflected in reproductive isolation between this population and the flies to be used in the release programme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dyer, Naomi A.","Ravel, Sophie","Choi, Kwang-Shik","Darby, Alistair C.","Causse, Sandrine","Kapitano, Berisha","Hall, Martin J.

For both species, increasing the size of a square target from 0.01 m2 (dimensions \u003d 0.1 x 0.1 m) to 1.0 m2 (1.0 x 1.0 m) increased the catch ,4x however the numbers of tsetse killed per unit area of target declined with target size suggesting that the most cost efficient targets are not the largest. For G. f. quanzensis, horizontal oblongs, (1 m wide x 0.5 m high) caught, 1.8x more tsetse than vertical ones (0.5 m wide x 1.0 m high) but the opposite applied for G. p. palpalis. Shape preference was consistent over the range of target sizes. For G. p. palpalis square targets caught as many tsetse as the oblong; while the evidence is less strong the same\r\nappears to apply to G. f. quanzensis. The results suggest that targets used to control G. p. palpalis and G. f. quanzensis should be square, and that the most  cost-effective designs, as judged by the numbers of tsetse caught per area of target, are likely to be in the region of 0.25 x 0.25 m2. The preference of G. p. palpalis for vertical oblongs is unique amongst tsetse species, and it is suggested that this response might be related to its anthropophagic behaviour and hence importance as a vector of HAT.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tirados, Inaki","Esterhuizen, Johan","Rayaisse, Jean Baptiste","Diarrassouba, Abdoulaye","Kaba, Dramane","Mpiana, Serge","Vale, Glyn A.","Solano, Philippe","Lehane, Michael J.","Torr, Stephen J."],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316339,"sim:weight":0.830658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316333,"sim:weight":0.750137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316045,"sim:weight":0.616963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316338,"sim:weight":0.602642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316331,"sim:weight":0.256802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.186544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.18634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.185796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.173431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.164277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.161654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.16114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.160426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.160423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.160231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.160231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.160231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.160231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.160231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.160231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A set of twenty two adaptation technologies are showcased that are primarily based on the principals of agroecology, but also include scientific technologies of climate and biological sciences complemented with important sociological and institutional capacity building processes that are required to make adaptation function.  The technologies cover monitoring and forecasting the climate, sustainable water use and management, soil management, sustainable crop management, seed conservation, sustainable forest management and sustainable livestock management. \r\n\r\nTechnologies that tend to homogenize the natural environment and agricultural production have low possibilities of success in conditions of environmental stress that are likely to result from climate change. On the other hand, technologies that allow for, and indeed promote, diversity are more likely to provide a strategy which strengthens agricultural production in the face of uncertain future climate change scenarios. In this sense, the twenty two technologies showcased in this Guidebook have been selected because they facilitate the conservation and restoration of diversity while at the same time providing opportunities for increasing agricultural productivity.  Many of these technologies are not new to agricultural production practices, but they are implemented based on assessment of current and possible future impacts of climate change in a particular location.  Agro-ecology is an approach that encompasses concepts of sustainable production and biodiversity promotion and therefore provides a useful framework for identifying and selecting appropriate adaptation technologies for the agricultural sector.\r\n\r\nThe Guidebook provides a systematic analysis of the most relevant information available on climate change adaptation technologies in the agriculture sector. It has been compiled based on a literature review of key publications, journal articles, and e-platforms, and by drawing on documented experiences sourced from a range of organizations working on projects and programmes concerned with climate change adaptation technologies in the agricultural sector. Its geographic scope is focused on developing countries where high levels of poverty, agricultural production, climate variability and biological diversity currently intersect.\r\n\r\nKey concepts around climate change adaptation are not universally agreed.  It is therefore important to understand local contexts – especially social and cultural norms - when working with national and sub-national stakeholders to make informed decisions about appropriate technology options. Thus, decision-making processes should be participative, facilitated, and consensus-building oriented and should be based on the following key guiding principles: increasing awareness and knowledge, strengthening institutions, protecting natural resources, providing financial assistance and developing context-specific strategies. \r\n\r\nFor decision-making the Community–Based Adaptation framework is proposed for creating inclusive governance that engages a range of stakeholders directly with local or district government and national coordinating bodies, and facilitates participatory planning, monitoring and implementation of adaptation activities.  Seven criteria are suggested for the prioritization of adaptation technologies: (i) The extent to which the technology maintains or strengthens biological diversity and is environmentally sustainable; (ii) The extent to which the technology facilitates access to information systems and awareness of climate change information; (iii) Whether the technology support water, carbon and nutrient cycles and enables stable and/or increased productivity; (iv) Income-generating potential, cost-benefit analysis and contribution to improved equity; (v) Respect for cultural diversity and facilitation of inter-cultural exchange; (vi) Potential for integration into regional and national policies and can be scaled-up; (vii) The extent to which the technology builds formal and information institutions and social networks.\r\n\r\nFinally, recommendations are set out for practitioners and policy makers:\r\n•\tThere is an urgent need for improved climate modelling and forecasting which can provide a basis for informed decision-making and the implementation of adaptation strategies.  This should include traditional knowledge.\r\n•\tInformation is also required to better understand the behaviour of plants, animals, pests and diseases as they react to climate change.\r\n•\tPotential changes in economic and social systems in the future under different climate scenarios should also be investigated so that the implications of adaptation strategy and planning choices are better understood.\r\n•\tIt is important to secure effective flows of information through appropriate dissemination channels.  This is vital for building adaptive capacity and decision-making processes.\r\n•\tImproved analysis of adaptation technologies is required to show how they can contribute to building adaptive capacity and resilience in the agricultural sector.  This information needs to be compiled and disseminated for a range of stakeholders from local to national level.\r\n•\tRelationships between policy makers, researchers and communities should be built so that technologies and planning processes are developed in partnership, responding to producers’ needs and integrating their knowledge.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clements, Rebecca","Haggar, Jeremy","Quezada, Alicia","Torres, Juan","Zhu, Xianli"],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":385507,"sim:weight":0.691923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":359903,"sim:weight":0.691818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5850231,"sim:weight":0.654443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.641356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.641356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.640247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.639401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1025888,"sim:weight":0.636319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5846600,"sim:weight":0.635916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96394,"sim:weight":0.625914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74101,"sim:weight":0.610586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":567987,"sim:weight":0.604349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81978,"sim:weight":0.586448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779116,"sim:weight":0.568343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1126287,"sim:weight":0.565385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1126835,"sim:weight":0.558717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":567991,"sim:weight":0.549141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643700,"sim:weight":0.547174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779122,"sim:weight":0.546775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664632,"sim:weight":0.546447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Potentially this is of particular concern for the newly developed small targets (0.25 high × 0.5 m wide) which show promise for cost-efficient control of Palpalis group tsetse flies. Consequently the performance of a small target was investigated for Glossina fuscipes fuscipes in Kenya, when the target was obscured following the placement of vegetation to simulate various degrees of natural bush encroachment. Catches decreased significantly only when the target was obscured by more than 80%. Even if a small target is underneath a very low overhanging bush (0.5 m above ground), the numbers of G. f. fuscipes decreased by only about 30% compared to a target in the open. We show that the efficiency of the small targets, even in small (1 m diameter) clearings, is largely uncompromised by vegetation re-growth because G. f. fuscipes readily enter between and under vegetation. The essential characteristic is that there should be some openings between vegetation.\r\n\r\nThis implies that for this important vector of HAT, and possibly other Palpalis group flies, a smaller initial clearance zone around targets can be made and longer interval between site maintenance visits is possible both of which will result in cost savings for large scale operations. We also investigated and discuss other site features e.g. large solid objects and position in relation to the water\u0027s edge in terms of the efficacy of the small targets.","bibo:AuthorList":["Esterhuizen, Johan","Njiru , Basilio","Vale, Glyn A.","Lehane, Michael J.","Torr, Stephen J."],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316333,"sim:weight":0.694036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316339,"sim:weight":0.614753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316332,"sim:weight":0.602642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316045,"sim:weight":0.495035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60875,"sim:weight":0.239726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.220763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.220598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.215506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.211429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.211428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.209546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.20555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61296,"sim:weight":0.197108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.194264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.193261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62357,"sim:weight":0.186776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.186646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.186646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.186646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.186646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Insecticide impregnated targets are one of the most effective tools for control. However, the cost of these devices still represents a constraint to their wider use. The objective was therefore to improve the cost effectiveness of  currently used devices.\r\nMethodology/Principal Findings: Experiments were performed on three tsetse species, namely Glossina palpalis gambiensis and G. tachinoides in Burkina Faso and G. p. palpalis in Côte d\u0027Ivoire. The 1×1 m2 black blue black target commonly used in W. Africa was used as the standard, and effects of changes in target size, shape, and the use of netting instead of black cloth were measured. Regarding overall target shape, we observed that horizontal targets (i.e. wider than they were high) killed 1.6-5x more G. p. gambiensis and G. tachinoides than vertical ones (i.e. higher than they were wide) (P\u003c0.001). For the three tsetse species including G. p. palpalis, catches were highly correlated with the size of the target. However, beyond the size of 0.75 m, there was no increase in catches. Replacing the black cloth of the target by netting was the most cost efficient for all three species.\r\nConclusion/Significance: Reducing the size of the current 1*1 m black-blue-black target to horizontal designs of around 50 cm and replacing black cloth by netting will improve cost effectiveness six-fold for both G. p. gambiensis and G. tachinoides. Studying the visual responses of tsetse to different designs of target has allowed us to design more cost-effective devices for the effective control of sleeping sickness and animal trypanosomiasis in Africa.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rayaisse, Jean Baptiste","Esterhuizen, Johan","Tirados, Inaki","Kaba, Dramane","Salou, Ernest","Diarrassouba, Abdoulaye","Vale, Glyn A.","Lehane, Michael J.","Torr, Stephen J.","Solano, Philippe"],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316332,"sim:weight":0.830658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316333,"sim:weight":0.723627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316045,"sim:weight":0.64129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316338,"sim:weight":0.614753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316376,"sim:weight":0.586071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.23127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.230975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.219044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.217836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.21032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.210051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.20275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.200281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.20019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.20019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.20019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.20019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.20019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.20019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.20019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

With the coming of peace, the Royal Navy had dropped rapidly in size, from nearly 950 ships in 1815 to 128 by 1821, and relied entirely on volunteers to man these ships.  It nonetheless remained in operation all over the world as an instrument of British foreign policy, with ships on the West African coast in anti-slave patrols, on the China station, in Australasia and North America, and in home waters and the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThis period also saw the start of the change from sail to steam.  By 1850 there were 71 steam ships and vessels in the Royal Navy compared to 106 sailing ships. This study considers the reasons sailors volunteered to serve with the Royal Navy, their training, promotion and career prospects, as well as their daily lives on board different types of ship at home and overseas, and how these changed during the period.\r\n\r\nContinuous service contracts provided for centralised administration, which made manning ships quicker and meant that for the first time most adult sailors joined the Navy rather than a specific ship. However, many of those who served in the Royal Navy before 1853 already regarded it as their main employer and had long and successful careers within it, with some signing up for longer periods of service.  Recruitment was not a problem for the Navy in this period, and rating systems, pay, training and conditions were already being improved to provide incentives for long service and the development of skills. The new contracts recognised changes that had already taken place in the way sailors saw themselves and the Royal Navy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Preston, Virginia"],"dc:date":"2008-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382859,"sim:weight":0.721844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.548534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.522197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2792468,"sim:weight":0.498114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769042,"sim:weight":0.489882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108361,"sim:weight":0.481631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388778,"sim:weight":0.481226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316069,"sim:weight":0.477697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86125,"sim:weight":0.47422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43389,"sim:weight":0.471818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381986,"sim:weight":0.458353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382026,"sim:weight":0.447188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183638,"sim:weight":0.445744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2923,"sim:weight":0.44374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57207,"sim:weight":0.443464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43920,"sim:weight":0.439455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46283,"sim:weight":0.434308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112506,"sim:weight":0.434189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710306,"sim:weight":0.432457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44884,"sim:weight":0.432421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The nature and characteristics of the relationships between them are captured through network analysis and visualization tools, with a dataset comprising inter-organisational lending relationships and organisations’ attributes over the years 2006-8. Focus is on the extent to which patterns in wholesale lending relationships relate to the legal status and characteristics of microfinance institutions; to the regulatory, business and social environment in which they operate; and to shifts in the balance between social and commercial interests of diverse types of lenders.\r\nThe analysis brings to light considerable cross-country variation in the structure and features of wholesale lending relationships, and relates it primarily to differences in governance and regulation. On this basis, it makes the case that building a more enabling regulatory environment for funding partnerships may improve the capacity of microfinance to achieve its dual goals of poverty alleviation and financial sustainability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marr, Ana","Tubaro, Paola"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1078774,"sim:weight":0.517352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316086,"sim:weight":0.479493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631727,"sim:weight":0.462708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316610,"sim:weight":0.409109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77763,"sim:weight":0.290813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631615,"sim:weight":0.242926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77250,"sim:weight":0.238196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1539967,"sim:weight":0.215953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46640,"sim:weight":0.213091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653028,"sim:weight":0.198681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387372,"sim:weight":0.191794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1348751,"sim:weight":0.188779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108984,"sim:weight":0.183728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.182154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.182154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43805,"sim:weight":0.174528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44822,"sim:weight":0.172375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.167917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145598,"sim:weight":0.167647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788824,"sim:weight":0.165782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Over the past twenty five years piracy has once again been increasing such that it has now become of serious concern to the maritime community, in particular the seafarer, who as always bears the brunt of these attacks.\r\n\r\nIn parallel with piracy itself the laws of piracy have developed from the Rhodian Laws through Roman Law, post Treaty of Westphalia Law both British and American until today the Law of Piracy is embodied in the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) of 1982. Under this Law piracy can only be committed on the high seas and with UNCLOS increasing the limit of the territorial sea from 3m1. to 12ml. many of the attacks upon shipping today cannot, legally, be classed as piracy but as armed robbery.\r\n\r\nPiracy and armed robbery at sea can consist of one or more of the following crimes upon the person: murder, violence actual or implied, rape, torture and disappearance and are considered a violation of the seafarers\u0027 human rights. The incidents and court cases cited in the thesis provide the basic information and evidence for this.\r\n\r\nOn the high seas the flag state has jurisdiction over the ship flying its flag and all on board whatever their nationality. In the territorial sea the coastal state has jurisdiction over the safe passage of a ship and is responsible for maintaining order. Many of the states in whose territorial sea these attacks take place are considered failing states unable to maintain order at sea due to lack of political will, resources and corruption. These are matters of law, international relations and the structure of a globalised maritime industry.\r\n\r\nIn effect this thesis argues that the flag or coastal State is failing by omission to uphold the human rights of the seafarer over whom it has jurisdiction. The seafarer may be able in one of the Human Rights Courts to obtain redress from these States but there are many prerequisites which are addressed in detail.","bibo:AuthorList":["Widd, Peter G."],"dc:date":"2008-05-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.584607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162956,"sim:weight":0.575742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5080256,"sim:weight":0.572446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1038815,"sim:weight":0.570327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":874620,"sim:weight":0.564662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18142,"sim:weight":0.560165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99223,"sim:weight":0.552113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8766454,"sim:weight":0.551193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98917,"sim:weight":0.550884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387122,"sim:weight":0.550411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99128,"sim:weight":0.547601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98910,"sim:weight":0.543886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77641,"sim:weight":0.538625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5087073,"sim:weight":0.537738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84818,"sim:weight":0.534562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187767,"sim:weight":0.532177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43702,"sim:weight":0.529472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99156,"sim:weight":0.529062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101171,"sim:weight":0.526016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780266,"sim:weight":0.525144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

What is more, tensions tend to lead to the fracturing of groups and greater exclusion of the poor, creating negative impacts on wellbeing.

These include the geometric variations of three types of the branch side channels (circular, rectangular, disc) and two types of the main channel (solid and concentric). Ignoring the initial transient behaviour and assuming that steady-state flow has been established, the behaviour of the blood fluid in the devices is algebraically analysed and numerically modelled.\r\nThe roles of the relevant microchannel mechanisms, i.e. bifurcation, constriction and bending channel, on promoting the separation process are analysed based on modelling results.

Modelling the impact of baits in heterogeneous environments","bibo:abstract":"Background: Eliminating Rhodesian sleeping sickness, the zoonotic form of Human African Trypanosomiasis, can be\r\nachieved only through interventions against the vectors, species of tsetse (Glossina). The use of insecticide-treated cattle is the most cost-effective method of controlling tsetse but its impact might be compromised by the patchy distribution of livestock. A deterministic simulation model was used to analyse the effects of spatial heterogeneities in habitat and baits (insecticide-treated cattle and targets) on the distribution and abundance of tsetse.\r\nMethodology/Principal Findings: The simulated area comprised an operational block extending 32 km from an area of good habitat from which tsetse might invade. Within the operational block, habitat comprised good areas mixed with poor ones where survival probabilities and population densities were lower. In good habitat, the natural daily mortalities of adults averaged 6.14% for males and 3.07% for females; the population grew 8.46in a year following a 90% reduction in densities of adults and pupae, but expired when the population density of males was reduced to \u003c0.1/km2; daily movement of adults averaged 249 m for males and 367 m for females. Baits were placed throughout the operational area, or patchily to simulate uneven distributions of cattle and targets. Gaps of 2–3 km between baits were inconsequential provided the average imposed mortality per km2 across the entire operational area was maintained. Leaving gaps 5–7 km wide inside an area where baits killed 10% per day delayed effective control by 4–11 years.

This work investigates the impact of a strong magnetic field on these measurement processes for weakly viscous, electrically conducting droplets. We present numerical results using an axisymmetric model that employs the pseudo-spectral collocation method and a recently developed 3D model. Both numerical models have been developed to solve the equations describing the coupled electromagnetic and fluid flow processes. The models represent the changing surface shape that results from the interaction between forces inside the droplet and the surface tension imposed boundary conditions. The models are used to examine the liquid droplet dynamics in a strong DC magnetic field. In each case the surface shape is decomposed into a superposition of spherical harmonic modes. The oscillation of the individual mode coefficients is then analysed to determine the oscillation frequencies and damping rates that are then compared to the low amplitude solutions predicted by the published analytical asymptotic theory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Easter, S.","Bojarevics, V.","Pericleous, K.","Meyer, Andreas","Egry, Ivan"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8932406,"sim:weight":0.632366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145764,"sim:weight":0.442235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43507,"sim:weight":0.420701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98753,"sim:weight":0.413453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23605,"sim:weight":0.409889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270137,"sim:weight":0.384301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45428,"sim:weight":0.360088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98505,"sim:weight":0.35874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.352824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269863,"sim:weight":0.348396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.33236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58759,"sim:weight":0.32922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99251,"sim:weight":0.327693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664565,"sim:weight":0.324846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631632,"sim:weight":0.324597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98521,"sim:weight":0.322686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23197,"sim:weight":0.308174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271192,"sim:weight":0.302604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48331,"sim:weight":0.29886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43138,"sim:weight":0.298078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Reducing energy consumption in the private realm is of prime importance, considering that 27% of all carbon emission stem from domestic households (HM Government, 2006). Space heating reflects the largest share of private energy use with 53%, followed by appliances and lighting (22%) and water heating (20%), making these the most relevant areas to address (HM Government, 2006). In fact, in recent years, most energy suppliers have started to provide their customers with information on how to reduce energy consumption, and gadgets such as energy monitors are easily available. Yet, consumption needs to decrease further to meet the ambitious targets defined by the Climate Change Act 2008 (http://www.theccc.org.uk/about-the-ccc/climate-change-act). One question that arises is how much energy consumption can be reduced without impacting negatively on personal comfort. \r\nWe addressed the question what comfort means and how people feel about their level of comfort in a study among social housing tenants in England. Participants were asked to define what comfort in the home means to them and how satisfied they were with the comfort their home provided. In a survey, their current behavioural practises with regard to energy consumption were assessed, together with a variety of related variables, such as perceived knowledge on energy saving and environmental awareness Participants also gave information on how they operated their heating system. The data was completed by assessing the stock condition and average energy consumption. \r\nPreliminary data show that “warmth” was the most important aspect of comfort, followed by security, space and privacy, and cleanliness. Likewise, discomfort was most often ascribed to coldness and drafts. The questions on current practices revealed that most participants took positive actions to reduce their energy consumption, such as turning off appliances completely. The study also revealed that many participants were unsure on how to most efficiently operate the heating system. \r\nTaken together, three important factors emerged that make energy reduction in the household difficult: Firstly, personal comfort is mainly determined by warmth. Secondly, behaviours other than cutting back on heat are already performed to a large extent. Thirdly, information on how to best operate the heating system are missing. The implications of these results for landlords and energy suppliers are discussed, with emphasis on how to use this information to reduce energy consumption in social housing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Huebner, Gesche","Cooper, Justine","Jones, Keith","Balmer, Ivo","Defila, Rico","Di Giulio, Antonietta","Kaufmann-Hayoz, Ruth","Kobel, Peter"],"dc:date":"2011-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1661925,"sim:weight":0.445852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84852,"sim:weight":0.402008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.344427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.328077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145949,"sim:weight":0.299415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1663130,"sim:weight":0.297408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88494,"sim:weight":0.296815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643243,"sim:weight":0.275657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778277,"sim:weight":0.269033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667029,"sim:weight":0.265947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1347779,"sim:weight":0.262431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15244,"sim:weight":0.254676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17994,"sim:weight":0.250308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.242972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67390,"sim:weight":0.238615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.236948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.235499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.235499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.235499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.235499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This knowledge is essential in designing adequate behaviour-focused interventions to save energy. Social housing tenants constitute an important target group as they are more likely to suffer from fuel poverty, and have little control over stock condition. Tenants report engagement in energy-saving behaviours, and willingness to engage in energy-saving practices. Perceived barriers to change are mainly having an established habit of behaviour and a lack of knowledge. Money was not reported as a stronger motivator for saving energy than protecting the environment or securing a liveable planet for future generations. Replacing habits and providing more information on energy saving are thus important steps towards lower energy consumption. Analysis of stock condition and of actual consumption needs to show if reduction via behaviour change are possible.","bibo:AuthorList":["Huebner, Gesche M.","Cooper, Justine","Jones, Keith","Chiang, T.S.","Moran, F.P."],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84852,"sim:weight":0.305068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661925,"sim:weight":0.302694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1663130,"sim:weight":0.296289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.257807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397716,"sim:weight":0.251338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643243,"sim:weight":0.249084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145949,"sim:weight":0.242115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88494,"sim:weight":0.241039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667029,"sim:weight":0.23092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1347779,"sim:weight":0.211709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761123,"sim:weight":0.200513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768963,"sim:weight":0.191764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15244,"sim:weight":0.18911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77237,"sim:weight":0.188996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.188802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88485,"sim:weight":0.18841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778277,"sim:weight":0.184479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667754,"sim:weight":0.181662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761088,"sim:weight":0.178285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95998,"sim:weight":0.176448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It provides as full an account as the available record permits of an important shipping industry sector that previously has received little serious historical consideration.\r\n\r\nMost of the ferry industry, dominated by its railway industry parent and ravaged by war losses, came into public ownership in 1948 as a consequence of railway nationalisation followed by a decade of under-investment. The period ended with a loss of supremacy for the railway-owned shipping sector, privatisation, increased\r\ncompetition, the 1987 Herald of Free Enterprise disaster – in no small part exacerbated by the drive through vehicle deck which had done so much to facilitate the ease of passenger car and freight movement - and the certainty of the Channel Tunnel, which spelt the end of sea transport primacy on its most important routes. The era saw ferries transformed in terms of design and capability from being largely tied to rail-connected passenger traffic, there came the innovation of roll-on, roll-off and the hovercraft, with ports undergoing change scarcely less extensive.\r\n\r\nThe thesis examines the basic structural changes that affected the industry, specifically the process that resulted in the establishment of privately-owned firms in\r\nsitu, the bureaucratic problems that beset British Railways and which hampered its formulation of a coherent response to the varied challenges it faced in the Fifties and Sixties. It shows how the growth in private motor car ownership proved a catalyst for change in a conservative industry and explores the way in which the introduction of newcomers and the hovercraft drove the development of competition, transforming the ferry business but ultimately leading to the government decision to construct a fixed link between the United Kingdom and France.\r\n\r\nThe thesis concludes that the drive and entrepreneurial flair of three private ferry operators, Townsend, Bustard and Thoresen, was largely responsible for the transformation of the industry and argues that the new and growing market created by motor transport would not have been exploited at such a rate or with the same degree of forethought and innovation without their involvement.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moses, William"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":54704,"sim:weight":0.556914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769042,"sim:weight":0.538061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54518,"sim:weight":0.524672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54373,"sim:weight":0.523951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13004,"sim:weight":0.504803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54510,"sim:weight":0.501476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3028,"sim:weight":0.452548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54313,"sim:weight":0.443202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54416,"sim:weight":0.421272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54211,"sim:weight":0.420446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54515,"sim:weight":0.412884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":326676,"sim:weight":0.408478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382026,"sim:weight":0.405202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.402577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731743,"sim:weight":0.398939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84370,"sim:weight":0.398609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43587,"sim:weight":0.39654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2792468,"sim:weight":0.394266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3169,"sim:weight":0.388692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1151965,"sim:weight":0.386834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Molecular methods, such as PCR, offer a rapid, sensitive and specific means of detecting pathogens, however loss of sensitivity and lack of robustness have been reported when PCR is applied to heterogeneous and complex food matrices. The aim of this study was to establish a rapid, reliable and sensitive molecular method to detect pathogens in food samples.\r\n\r\nReal-time PCR assays for the detection of Campylobacter jejuni and coli, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica and Staphylococcus aureus in food enrichment samples were developed. A novel organism was constructed using a gfp gene cloned into the chromosome of a non-pathogenic Escherichia coli. Viable cells of the modified strain were encapsulated in Lenticule discs and used as process control in the PCR assays. MagNA Pure™ automated extraction was shown to be robust and reliable for preparing bacterial DNA from food enrichment broths. The PCR assays and MagNA Pure™ was applied to enrichment broths inoculated with 558 naturally-contaminated food and environmental samples in a field trial. Concordance was found between PCR results and those obtained using standard culture methods. Loss of assay sensitivity or PCR inhibition was detected in 6 % (32) of the enrichment samples. To improve the sensitivity the L monocytogenes hlyA gene PCR was nested. The assay was applied for the sensitive non-cultural diagnosis of listeriosis, with L monocytogenes detected in 15 of 17 clinical samples from patients with suspected listeriosis.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, these assays provided a high throughput, robust, reliable PCR detection methods that could be used in clinical and food testing laboratories. The methods will be essential in outbreak situations and could be further developed to detecting bacterial pathogens, viruses, parasites, new and emerging pathogens.","bibo:AuthorList":["Murphy, Niamh Marie"],"dc:date":"2009-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":980842,"sim:weight":0.584298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":518934,"sim:weight":0.576158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5726193,"sim:weight":0.539059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99418,"sim:weight":0.490508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102664,"sim:weight":0.469388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77058,"sim:weight":0.464551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5731742,"sim:weight":0.452658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5724352,"sim:weight":0.447826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1024118,"sim:weight":0.440869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931069,"sim:weight":0.439727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1024713,"sim:weight":0.432284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145855,"sim:weight":0.425029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":855659,"sim:weight":0.417833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":923202,"sim:weight":0.407832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5724359,"sim:weight":0.407519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105092,"sim:weight":0.406859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5731981,"sim:weight":0.39881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1563532,"sim:weight":0.395533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5861499,"sim:weight":0.395384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666887,"sim:weight":0.389769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Detailed analysis of local wind patterns at four sites (two coastal and two inland) strongly suggested the presence of seas breezes, reaching maximum frequency between March and August and fewest occurrences between November and February. Transport of PM10 over 30 km inland was also inferred.\r\n\r\nIn addition to local wind transport, the location of the pollution monitoring sites and their environment are key to explaining the differences in PM10 concentrations recorded between the sites. The 10 sites located on roadsides registered the highest number of particle counts, followed by the five sites located within urban areas. The lowest amount of particles was found at the two rural sites. The five roadside sites closest to London (two in Gravesham and three in Dartford) exceeded the daily recommended amount of 50 μg/m3 several times each month, probably reflecting the increased road traffic in those areas.\r\n\r\nAside from the variation in PM10 amount between sites, seasonal differences were also observed, with the lowest amount of PM10 recorded in the autumn and the highest in spring.\r\n\r\nEpisodes of pollution affecting the whole of Kent were also observed. These were more clearly related to the synoptic situation rather than any local wind variations and appear to indicate regional or trans-boundary pollution transport. The latter is also supported by preliminary evidence from a PM10 trap sampling at a site on the south coast.","bibo:AuthorList":["Perea, Virginia Nicolas"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":700372,"sim:weight":0.403036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":660972,"sim:weight":0.401648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":664902,"sim:weight":0.369524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58797,"sim:weight":0.327383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001955,"sim:weight":0.305439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":660512,"sim:weight":0.246886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":660881,"sim:weight":0.237968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5837979,"sim:weight":0.224369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50187,"sim:weight":0.223195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":664711,"sim:weight":0.223102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":661002,"sim:weight":0.210435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.192081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108986,"sim:weight":0.16699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":662722,"sim:weight":0.155279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50125,"sim:weight":0.100966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":316478,"ep:Repository":51,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"An examination of collaborative working in child protection","bibo:abstract":"Background\r\nCollaborative working between health and social care professionals in child protection work has been generally promoted in the western world as best practice (Laming 2009, HM Govt 2010). Problems in achieving effective collaborative working have beset child protection systems and have been a constant feature in a number of serious case reviews (Brandon et al 2010). Collaboration between professionals of different disciplines is complex and involves interpersonal, interprofessional and interorganisational dimensions.\r\n\r\nAim\r\nThe aim of this research project was to investigate the extent to which health and social services professionals practising within two health and local authorities perceived that a collaborative approach was adopted between the two agencies when working both with families where there were children in need of services and families where there were children in need of protection. Factors that may enhance or inhibit collaboration were explored.\r\n\r\nMethod\r\nThe sample used was a purposive sample, comprising social workers and health professionals working in one of two boroughs. A case study approach was adopted and data collection involved a mixed approach of both qualitative and quantitative methods. A postal survey across the two boroughs was undertaken, using a questionnaire which was distributed on two separate occasions to allow comparison of the extent to which there was effective collaboration pre and post the Laming Inquiry. The questionnaire included a series of brief vignettes and a multi staged vignette, based on real life cases which were anonymised and were developed to assess the application of thresholds across the two boroughs and across professional disciplines, and to explore collaboration throughout the safeguarding continuum. The questionnaire used a number of open, closed and scaled questions to generate both quantitative and qualitative data. The questionnaire was distributed to a total of 311 practitioners at the pre Laming stage and to a total of 300 practitioners post Laming.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nIn analysing the responses from participants across health and social care, a number of important themes have emerged. The responses to the vignettes demonstrated different levels of professional participation in work both with children in need and at different stages of the process for children in need of protection. Professionals in the borough with established child in need policies valued the multi-agency approach that was adopted in work where there are children in need of services There was lack of consensus in several of the cases in terms of thresholds of concern; a range of factors that may enhance or inhibit collaboration were identified, including shared thresholds, the practice of informal joint meetings, joint assessment and joint training. The majority of respondents believed the Laming Inquiry had impacted on collaboration in both areas of practice, children in need of services and children in need of protection. Although a number of positive outcomes of the Laming Inquiry were identified, the impact in terms of work load and stress generated as a result of policy change from the Inquiry were highlighted. In analysing responses in the current study, a theme that was very evident was the extent to which the emotional impact of safeguarding work affects the ability of professionals to achieve a collaborative way of working. In reflecting on the findings of the research the following recommendations are made:\r\n\r\nRecommendations\r\nIn undertaking this current research and reflecting upon the learning that has taken place, as a result of the valuable input from professionals who participated, the following recommendations are made:\r\n\r\nRecommendations at the level of practice\r\n1.

The present work examines the use of accelerated carbonation to reduce the hazardous properties of wastes as a means of reducing the costs of disposal to landfill, and then develops the process to manufacture aggregate from the waste removing it from landfill disposal completely .\r\n\r\nA range of thermal wastes, including those from cement, metallurgical and paper processes, were found to be reactive with carbon dioxide. Many of these wastes are hazardous on account of their alkaline pH, which carbonation partially neutralizes, effectively allowing reclassification of the materials as stable non-reactive hazardous wastes under the Landfill Regulations. Cement and paper wastes were highly reactive with carbon dioxide, and were considered for use as cement substitutes to reconstitute non-reactive wastes into aggregate.\r\n\r\nPrevious work had suggested that carbonation and pelletising were not compatible due to differing optimum conditions. This issue was investigated by considering the effects of the mix formulations and machinery parameters. The pelletising and carbonation processes require widely different moisture contents. The disparity is due to the need for total saturation of the material to form bonds between grains during pelletising, and an open pore network for carbon dioxide to penetrate. To achieve the two simultaneously, several methods were investigated. Chemical catalysts including sodium hypochlorite and sodium sulfite increased carbonation in a saturated material. However, curing the formed aggregates in carbon dioxide was found to be the most economic solution.\r\n\r\nA pilot scale process was developed based upon the laboratory results. A bespoke rotary carbonation reactor was developed to produce aggregate in bulk for commercial testing. Aggregate which was subjected to accelerated carbonation, has enhanced strength and durability compared to aggregate exposed to natural carbonation. The aggregate was successfully used to produce lightweight concrete with comparable strength to concrete made from commercial lightweight aggregate. Aggregate was also supplied for a research project to investigate the use of recycled materials as a horticultural growing medium.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gunning, Peter John"],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2673604,"sim:weight":0.47342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107173,"sim:weight":0.473157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573417,"sim:weight":0.463793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43951,"sim:weight":0.415586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2672437,"sim:weight":0.400955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146045,"sim:weight":0.399158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631994,"sim:weight":0.389765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12015,"sim:weight":0.3865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631076,"sim:weight":0.381513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43914,"sim:weight":0.375512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2702390,"sim:weight":0.374453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1039266,"sim:weight":0.370633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77568,"sim:weight":0.362476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1132142,"sim:weight":0.358128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":741241,"sim:weight":0.34795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2810804,"sim:weight":0.344817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386995,"sim:weight":0.344086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":120965,"sim:weight":0.338763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":918027,"sim:weight":0.337541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":917670,"sim:weight":0.336123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The effectiveness and efficiency of the stock condition survey process to support planned maintenance has previously been questioned and a more sustainable approach, based on an objective assessment of a built environment and infrastructure performance, has been suggested. Previous attempts to develop objective-based (though not performance–based) maintenance models have largely failed, due to the limitations of technology, the daunting task of managing large amounts of data, and the inability of mathematically based models to cope with the complexity of real-life situations.\r\n\r\nThis thesis addresses this challenge by exploring the feasibility of a performance-based assessment methodology to determine the maintenance needs of a buried oil steel-pipeline system and the impact that any changes in condition may have on the performance and integrity of related components in the pipeline system. The thesis also contains an evaluation of the ability and effectiveness of piezoelectric elements in pipeline defect (crack) signature detection to predict changes in component performance with data sets derived experimentally using laboratory bench testing. Vibration sound-emission detection techniques performed on various oil steel-pipeline defects, using non-destructive testing methods, were validated using attenuation and waveform analysis.\r\n\r\nDefect size and progression (i.e. the pattern characteristics of the defect) were monitored, measured and identified through spectrum analysis of multiple emission signals in combination with a number of frequency bands. Two series of tests were undertaken to evaluate the ability of vibration sound emission characteristics to identify steel pipeline defects, including leakage. Test Series 1 established the frequency (waveforms) of the generation of the acoustic emission signal caused by normal fluid dynamics (water flow) through the experimental steel pipe and the resulting signal propagation characteristics. Test Series 2 detected and monitored changes in the signal characteristics for incipient defects: (a) small-nail damage, (b) medium-sized nail damage, (c) large-nail damage and (d) crack to leakage source [sealed holes as a simulated corrosion to total failure]; oil was the fluid medium.\r\n\r\nThe defect sources and leakage signals were also studied, and compared with theoretical models. The results of the theoretical analysis and the laboratory experiments confirmed the ability of non-destructive testing, based on vibration sound emission techniques, to detect and distinguish between different failure modes.\r\n\r\nThe ability to carry out a basic inspection, analysis and report of a pipeline using an integrated-sensor device offers many potential benefits. The use of an integrated-sensor device is expected to provide valuable pipeline management information. Specifically the ability to detect and locate mechanical damage at the incipient stage and provide an assessment of the overall pipeline operating condition, including changes in performance profile and prediction of an estimated time to failure, has been shown to be feasible as part of a pipeline maintenance and rehabilitation programme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Umeadi, Boniface B.N."],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2696581,"sim:weight":0.517249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":733109,"sim:weight":0.515895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":878116,"sim:weight":0.511055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50613,"sim:weight":0.492941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.491254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":686498,"sim:weight":0.488933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":793415,"sim:weight":0.482712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80926,"sim:weight":0.479749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5721266,"sim:weight":0.478199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.462105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9030191,"sim:weight":0.460038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5850408,"sim:weight":0.450661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.443609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.443609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.443609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.443609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.443609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.443609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.443609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.443609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Yet, there are a number of shortcomings associated with research in this area. \r\n\r\nFirstly, there is a tendency to homogenise the achievement levels of all Black students. Thus observations made about the outcomes of African-Caribbean students are often applied to all other Black groups. When distinctions between African and African Caribbean groups have been made, the achievement levels of students from different African backgrounds are often merged, creating a misleading impression of their different academic outcomes. \r\n\r\nSecondly, studies seeking to provide explanations for the low attainment levels of Black students are often critical of life within Black families, in particular their assumed use of an „authoritarian‟ parenting style, which is seen as creating psychological problems in children and as hindering their achievement. Effectively, such notions serve to pathologise Black families in Britain. \r\n\r\nThis thesis presents a critique of existing studies concerning Black families in Britain and the academic achievement of Black (African) children, and also seeks to address existing gaps in the knowledge about Black Africans residing in Britain. Life history interviews were conducted with 25 British-Ghanaians who have achieved highly in their academic and professional pursuits. The findings suggest that not all parents adopted an „authoritarian‟ approach when raising their children, and that those who did were influenced by their own socialisation experiences in Ghana. While some respondents experienced some socio-emotional problems resulting from their „authoritarian‟ socialisation, these were generally resolved and did not have a long-term impact on their attainment. \r\n\r\nThe thesis also suggests that the use of discipline, associated with this parenting style, may have had some beneficial effects in relation to respondents‟ academic and professional outcomes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Owusu-Kwarteng, Louise"],"dc:date":"2010-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108621,"sim:weight":0.679904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778976,"sim:weight":0.664313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383595,"sim:weight":0.644682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.62597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382060,"sim:weight":0.625848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43649,"sim:weight":0.624463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709893,"sim:weight":0.615714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48401,"sim:weight":0.611913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145629,"sim:weight":0.61067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.610524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710073,"sim:weight":0.602193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710663,"sim:weight":0.575232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101496,"sim:weight":0.564062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97950,"sim:weight":0.562946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352158,"sim:weight":0.55286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.532111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381950,"sim:weight":0.524059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85451,"sim:weight":0.515662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761080,"sim:weight":0.506759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666433,"sim:weight":0.505392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It also draws of on lessons learnt from my experience working in North America in the early years of my career.\r\n\r\nThe main aims of my research were to: (1) Appraise the contribution an educational psychologist could make in assessing the learning potential of children and young people with SEBDs, and (2) Consider the „added value‟ that an educational psychologist might bring to enable these children as better learners and teachers as better teachers of children with SEBDs.\r\n\r\n45 Children and young people with Social Emotional Behavioural Difficulties and their parents and teachers participated in the research. A mixed methods approach was employed to undertake three related case studies and a reflexive and narrative analysis was employed.\r\n\r\nMain outcomes of the research were (i) SEBDs were almost always accompanied by often unrecognised learning difficulties; (ii) A cognitive assessment by an educational psychologist had an added value in understanding the needs of the child; (iii) When parents and teachers of children who participated in an especially designed intervention, it changed their views of their children‟s behaviours. They reported significant improvement in their children‟s social skills and behaviour.\r\n\r\nI conclude the thesis by considering the implications of findings for the benefit of children with SEBDs. It is crucial that teachers identify and assess learning difficulties in all children and young people and clearly differentiate these from matters of and interventions for behaviour difficulties.\r\n\r\nTeachers and parents can be empowered to deal with their children‟s behavioural difficulties by involving the Educational Psychologist as a pedagogue, sitting as he or she does at the crossroads of education and psychology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rehal, Ashok Kumar"],"dc:date":"2011-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77943,"sim:weight":0.744193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.731725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156832,"sim:weight":0.729635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82335,"sim:weight":0.712371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2823,"sim:weight":0.71088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270152,"sim:weight":0.706003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108221,"sim:weight":0.699382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631518,"sim:weight":0.690863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85132,"sim:weight":0.670957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222794,"sim:weight":0.665019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155723,"sim:weight":0.660215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2851,"sim:weight":0.651024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23452,"sim:weight":0.64988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76402,"sim:weight":0.641706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43974,"sim:weight":0.637968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999565,"sim:weight":0.6373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309360,"sim:weight":0.630317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.629051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3214,"sim:weight":0.625893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2859,"sim:weight":0.625731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The study suggests key values for civic engagement and ‘embeddedness’ and discusses them to speculate on the future of civic engagement and the ‘embeddedness’ of older people. The study argues that although in reality classic bureaucratic tendencies may undermine an organisation’s own policies promoting civic engagement, as happened in Greenwich, this is not inevitable if all the parties can understand the dynamic and transactional interaction mechanisms as and when individuals build up social networks within and beyond such organisations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tobari, Eime"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67164,"sim:weight":0.5281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.448686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.436663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.436663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.436663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.436663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.436663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.436663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.436663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.436663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.436663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.436663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.436663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.436663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.436663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.436663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.430865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586881,"sim:weight":0.423684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316088,"sim:weight":0.422794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.403104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Since a measurement of learners‟ learning performance was needed, an adaptable personalised e-learning system (ALPELS) was developed to create an environment where a qualitative measurement could be done. Experimental data was then gathered from two cohorts of MSc students over two semesters, who used the newly designed and developed online learning environment.\r\n\r\nThe successful implementation of the project has produced a large amount of data, which demonstrates a correlation between i) adaptable and personalised e-learning systems, and ii) learners‟ learning styles (which in itself supports the behaviouristic approach towards this type of online learning environment – ALPELS).\r\n\r\nThe study indicates a dependency between an online controlled learning environment and learners‟ learning performances, showing that a personalised e-learning system (PELS) would be supportive of recall (R) and understanding (U) types of content materials (with an indication of 4.89%), but also demonstrating an increase in student learning performance in an adaptable e-learning system (ALELS) while using competency (C) types of content materials (with an indication of 5.43%).

The schemes need a nonlinear solver to take care of the residual at the interface. The adaptive-∝ solver can converge locally in the ∞-norm, where the sufficient condition requires a relatively small local neighbourhood and the problem must have a strongly diagonal dominant Jacobian matrix with a very small condition number. Yet its advantage can be of high signicance in the computational cost where it simply needs a scalar as the approximation of Jacobian matrix. Other nonlinear solvers employed for the schemes are a Newton-GMRES method, a Newton method with a finite difference Jacobian approximation, and nonlinear conjugate gradient solvers with Fletcher-Reeves and Pollak-Ribiere searching direction formulas.\r\n\r\nThe schemes are applied to three nonlinear problems. The first problem is a heat conduction in a multichip module where there the domain is assembled from many components of\r\ndifferent conductivities and physical sizes. Here the implementations of the schemes satisfy the component meshing and gluing concept. A finite difference approximation of the residual of the governing equation turns out to be a better defect equation than the equality of normal derivative. Of all the nonlinear solvers implemented in the defect correction scheme, the nonlinear conjugate gradient method with Fletcher-Reeves searching direction has the best performance.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is a 2D single-phase  fluid flow with heat transfer where the PHOENICS CFD code is used to run the subdomain computation. The Newton method with a finite\r\ndifference Jacobian is a reasonable interface solver in coupling these subdomain computations. The final problem is a multiphase heat and moisture transfer in a porous textile. The PHOENICS code is also used to solve the system of partial differential equations governing the multiphase process in each subdomain while the coupling of the subdomain solutions is taken care of with some FORTRAN codes by the defect correction schemes. A scheme using a modified-∝ method fails to obtain decent solutions in both single and two layers case.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the scheme using the above Newton method produces satisfying results for both cases where it can lead an initially distant interface data into a good convergent solution. However, it is found that in general the number of nonlinear iteration of the defect correction schemes increases with the mesh refinement.","bibo:AuthorList":["Siahaan, Antony"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47315,"sim:weight":0.545159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316091,"sim:weight":0.521439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43087,"sim:weight":0.517159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633887,"sim:weight":0.496744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6185659,"sim:weight":0.486847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43175,"sim:weight":0.472574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43102,"sim:weight":0.467996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8791246,"sim:weight":0.460837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43135,"sim:weight":0.459398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50838,"sim:weight":0.454081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97536,"sim:weight":0.45332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664565,"sim:weight":0.447866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43138,"sim:weight":0.439319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.436842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1018272,"sim:weight":0.435618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316058,"sim:weight":0.431644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4894142,"sim:weight":0.415147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.414906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43089,"sim:weight":0.414436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633578,"sim:weight":0.411044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Maintenance and repairs resulting primarily from premature concrete cracking and spalling have an estimated cost running to $100 billion per annum world-wide. The continual demands for greater load carrying capacity of existing infrastructure only exacerbate the problem. \r\n\r\nIn practice, concrete crack width propagation is seen as one of the most important criteria for design and assessment of the long term serviceability of concrete structures. It is therefore economically beneficial to have a fundamental understanding of the growth of the crack width over time so that better informed decisions can be made regarding the carrying out of any repairs. \r\n\r\nThis research attempts to examine the process of concrete cracking and determine the surface crack width of concrete structures under the combined effects of reinforcement corrosion and applied load in both an analytical and numerical manner. \r\n\r\nIn the analytical method, a model for stiffness reduction of cracked concrete has been derived based on the concept of fracture energy and an analytical solution has been\r\nobtained. \r\n\r\nIn the numerical method, an interfacial element has been developed to predict concrete crack width under combined effects based on a cohesive crack model in conjunction with finite element codes. To help accurate prediction of crack width in the numerical method, a realistic constitutive relationship for concrete under direct tension has been obtained from the laboratory experiments. It is concluded in this thesis that both the analytical and numerical methods are one of very few available theoretical methods that can predict with reasonable accuracy concrete crack width of reinforced concrete structures under the combined effects of reinforcement corrosion and applied load. \r\n\r\nThis research focuses on concrete cracking caused by reinforcement corrosion and applied load without considering other factors, e.g., weathering, freeze-thaw and chemical attack. Both methods can be used as a tool to assess the serviceability of corrosion affected concrete infrastructure if reinforcement corrosion and applied load are the main causal factors of concrete cracking. \r\n\r\nFor this type of concrete structures, therefore, scientific information can be provided for asset managers in decision making regarding possible interventions. Timely interventions have the potential to prolong the service life of reinforced concrete structures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yang, Shangtong"],"dc:date":"2010-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5834826,"sim:weight":0.635486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12093,"sim:weight":0.628216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":839750,"sim:weight":0.609761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5837147,"sim:weight":0.606038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101340,"sim:weight":0.564143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77359,"sim:weight":0.54962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81532,"sim:weight":0.546639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4869087,"sim:weight":0.544347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":909872,"sim:weight":0.535948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43797,"sim:weight":0.514631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":865318,"sim:weight":0.513893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26027,"sim:weight":0.508429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5827561,"sim:weight":0.500185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5843500,"sim:weight":0.49286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":918727,"sim:weight":0.492666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1021067,"sim:weight":0.491315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1037141,"sim:weight":0.490508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1015768,"sim:weight":0.488695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2696598,"sim:weight":0.485111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1021231,"sim:weight":0.483172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, not all products are capable of being conveyed in dense phase and it is often difficult to predict which products have dense phase capability without carrying out pilot conveying trials. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of this work was to investigate the effect of bulk particular properties on pneumatic conveying performance. To achieve this, an extensive programme of conveying trials was carried out and each product tested was subjected to a series of bench scale tests to evaluate the bulk properties of the material. \r\n\r\nA phase diagram is proposed, based on the aeration properties of a material, which groups together products of similar conveying potential. The phase diagram gives a first indication on the basis of a small sample of material whether or not a product is capable of dense phase conveying. Further, it will predict the most appropriate mode of flow. \r\n\r\nFor products capable of dense phase in a moving bed type flow regime, a further correlation is proposed which predicts the likely conveying performance in the pipeline in terms of mass throughput of product for given conditions based on the air retention characteristics of a product. The correlation has been generalised to extend its applicability to a range of pipeline configurations. The combination of the phase diagram and the correlation for dense phase moving bed type flow (the most commonly used form of dense phase conveying) provides a powerful design tool which will reduce the need for full conveying trials. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the effect of material bulk properties on blow tank performance has also been investigated and a correlation between aeration properties and blow tank discharge characteristics is proposed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Mark G."],"dc:date":"1988-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43486,"sim:weight":0.395594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102643,"sim:weight":0.329514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387291,"sim:weight":0.287116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103113,"sim:weight":0.27374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316485,"sim:weight":0.269914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43190,"sim:weight":0.24511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":597467,"sim:weight":0.233073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397168,"sim:weight":0.228736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108837,"sim:weight":0.217546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101459,"sim:weight":0.215125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108347,"sim:weight":0.214522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103060,"sim:weight":0.213679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102687,"sim:weight":0.212437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387281,"sim:weight":0.211458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101348,"sim:weight":0.211327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4868867,"sim:weight":0.207328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99069,"sim:weight":0.204786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43820,"sim:weight":0.202444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":756327,"sim:weight":0.202124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101603,"sim:weight":0.198802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Sophisticated computer graphics can then reveal the inner workings of a problem in\r\nminute, colourful, detail.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pericleous, Kyriacos"],"dc:date":"2011-12-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99107,"sim:weight":0.274104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.27395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66899,"sim:weight":0.266604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98519,"sim:weight":0.262231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.245876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43589,"sim:weight":0.238783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57289,"sim:weight":0.23132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48375,"sim:weight":0.226387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387347,"sim:weight":0.223172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634700,"sim:weight":0.215171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43117,"sim:weight":0.207621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99233,"sim:weight":0.206192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54103,"sim:weight":0.204854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59232,"sim:weight":0.196963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98966,"sim:weight":0.194371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98898,"sim:weight":0.192974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44505,"sim:weight":0.190124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98504,"sim:weight":0.189486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.188434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108269,"sim:weight":0.183151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The introduction of Euro 6 standard (Latest European Union Legislation)leading to increase in power density of power electronics in ECU has even amplified the device thermal challenge. Heat generated within the unit coupled with ambient temperature makes the system reliability susceptible to thermal degradation which ultimately may result in failure. Previous investigations\r\nshow that the technology of thermal interface materials (TIMs) is a key to achieving good heat conductions\r\nwithin a package and from a package to heat sinking device. With studies suggesting that current TIMs contribute about 60% interfacial thermal resistance, a review of engineering materials has become imperative to identify TIM that could enhance heat transfer. This paper critically reviews the state-of-theart in TIMs which may be applicable to automotive ECU. Our review shows that carbon-nanotube (CNT)\r\nwhen used as the structure of TIM or TIM filler could considerably advance thermal management issues by improving heat dissipation from the ECU. This search identifies chemical vapor deposition (CVD) as a low cost process for the commercial production of CNTs.

Nonetheless, the presence of voids in the die bond layer impedes heat flow and thus increases the chip junction temperature. Such voids which form easily in the solder joint during solder reflow process at manufacturing stage are primarily occasioned by out-gassing phenomenon. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is employed to investigate the thermal effects of lead-free solder void percentages and configurations on packaged semiconductor device. The thermal resistance for each voiding case is calculated to evaluate the thermal response of the resultant electronic package. The results show that for equivalent void percentage, thermal resistance increases more for large coalesced type voids in comparison to the small distributed void configurations. The results would assist packaging and design engineers in setting criteria for assessments of the thermal impacts of different solder void patterns.","bibo:AuthorList":["Otiaba, K.C.","Bhatti, R.S.","Ekere, N.N.","Ekpu, M.","Adeyemi, J."],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58421,"sim:weight":0.388722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1002290,"sim:weight":0.368435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664518,"sim:weight":0.294892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46434,"sim:weight":0.286347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934593,"sim:weight":0.241221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99369,"sim:weight":0.236975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933650,"sim:weight":0.228573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382863,"sim:weight":0.221762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933621,"sim:weight":0.218324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27098,"sim:weight":0.181899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99457,"sim:weight":0.179714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17994,"sim:weight":0.178259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31540,"sim:weight":0.167688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17954,"sim:weight":0.167531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385947,"sim:weight":0.166471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43899,"sim:weight":0.159839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383506,"sim:weight":0.147518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85046,"sim:weight":0.133484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45018,"sim:weight":0.130012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1998696,"sim:weight":0.126426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although an important epidemiological variable, identifying flies which carry transmissible infections is difficult, with challenges including low prevalence, presence of other trypanosome species in the same fly, and concurrent detection of immature non-transmissible infections. Diagnostic tests to measure the prevalence of T. b. rhodesiense in tsetse are applied and interpreted inconsistently, and discrepancies between studies suggest this value is not consistently estimated even to within an order of magnitude.\r\n\r\nMethodology/Principal Findings: Three approaches were used to estimate the prevalence of transmissible Trypanosoma brucei s.l. and T. b. rhodesiense in Glossina swynnertoni and G. pallidipes in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania: (i) dissection/microscopy; (ii) PCR on infected tsetse midguts; and (iii) inference from a mathematical model. Using dissection/microscopy the prevalence of transmissible T. brucei s.l. was 0% (95% CI 0–0.085) for G. swynnertoni and 0% (0–0.18) G. pallidipes; using PCR the prevalence of transmissible T. b. rhodesiense was 0.010% (0–0.054) and 0.0089% (0–0.059) respectively, and by model inference 0.0064% and 0.00085% respectively.\r\n\r\nConclusions/Significance: The zero prevalence result by dissection/microscopy (likely really greater than zero given the results of other approaches) is not unusual by this technique, often ascribed to poor sensitivity. The application of additional techniques confirmed the very low prevalence of T. brucei suggesting the zero prevalence result was attributable to insufficient sample size (despite examination of 6000 tsetse). Given the prohibitively high sample sizes required to obtain meaningful results by dissection/microscopy, PCR-based approaches offer the current best option for assessing trypanosome prevalence in tsetse but inconsistencies in relating PCR results to transmissibility highlight the need for a consensus approach to generate meaningful and comparable data.","bibo:AuthorList":["Auty, Harriet K.","Picozzi, Kim","Malele, Imna","Torr, Steve J.","Cleaveland, Sarah","Welburn, Sue"],"dc:date":"2012-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316045,"sim:weight":0.421725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":600723,"sim:weight":0.39448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":969840,"sim:weight":0.335379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666887,"sim:weight":0.305127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2765068,"sim:weight":0.247546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.207391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.192154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.19186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.190062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643700,"sim:weight":0.188115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145646,"sim:weight":0.183156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.181303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.181303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.181303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.181303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.181303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.181303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.181303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.181303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.181303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As the functions of ECU in systems have increased in recent times, the number of components per unit area on its\r\nboard has also risen. High board density boosts internal heat generated per unit time in ECU ambient. The generated heat induces stress and strain at the chip interconnects due to variation in the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) and thermal conductivity of different bonded materials\r\nin the assembly. Thermal degradation could become critical and impacts device’s efficiency. The life expectancy of electronic components reduces exponentially as the operating temperature rises thus making thermal management pivotal in electronic system reliability. Since materials’\r\nproperties vary with operating condition, material performance has become a major consideration in the design of heat dissipation mechanism in ECU. The development of advanced thermal management materials and hence improving the performance of ECU requires an in-depth understanding of the complex relationship between materials’ properties and their behaviours at elevated temperatures.

The research was carried out in collaboration with ArcelorMittal Research (AMR), based in Maizieres-les-Metz in France. The industrial objective of the thesis was to understand the factors affecting the transient behaviour of the liquid slag layer covering the steel and its interaction with the Submerged Entry Nozzle (SEN) jet supplying the steel from the tundish to the Continuous Casting (CC) mould. The study includes the very complex phenomenon of argon bubble transport which also affects the behaviour of the slag layer and SEN jet. The model developed in this study is based on the finite volume method with the liquid regions (steel, slag) solved in an Eulerian scheme on a fixed unstructured mesh. The interface behaviour is modelled using a number of VOF type schemes, including the time-efficient Counter Diffusion Method (CDM). A coupled Lagrangian particle tracking scheme is used to represent the presence of argon bubbles and their influence on the flowfield (mainly due to buoyancy) in conjunction with the fluctuating surface dynamics. The bulk of the research concerns comparisons against flowfield and interface data obtained from an experimental water/oil study of the process. However, the model is extended to include predictions of heat transfer and phase change in the steel and flux powder regions in an industrial CC unit and validation against available data. The three-phase model is developed making use of the unstructured mesh multi-physics finite volume code PHYSICA [1]. \r\n\r\nAs stated, the main goal of this particular work has to do with the study of the dynamic behaviour of the steel/slag interface, including the effects of casting speed and injected gas. Because of the great difficulty in physical experiments with a real caster, the research is supported with water model experiments and mathematical simulation. Comparisons of observed interface profiles, measured and predicted mean and fluctuating velocities, gave an insight to the degree of coupling between interface behaviour and the fluid dynamics within the mould region. In particular, a spectral analysis of the dominant fluctuation frequencies in the water/oil experiment suggests a strong link between the upper and lower recirculation loops generated by the SEN jet as it splits after contact with the narrow face for the mould. The presence of gas bubbles alters the spectral picture, since the buoyancy induced in the flow affects the behaviour of the jet, leading to the one/two loop behaviour known from experiments. Good qualitative and quantitative agreement was achieved between the numerical results and water-model experimental data. The main observations drawn from the water model simulation and experiment are as follows: \r\n\r\n- An increase in casting speed, which is equivalent to an increase in SEN velocity leads to an increase in the amplitude of interfacial fluctuations.\r\n \r\n- At the highest SEN velocities, the oil layer is pushed away from the narrow ends of the mould, exposing the water surface to air. \r\n\r\n- When there is no oil on top of the water surface, the surface remains for all practical purpose flat. \r\n\r\n- Air entering through the SEN influences the flowfield in the mould and also disturbs the oil/water interface when it passes through it. \r\n\r\n- The ratio of water to air flow rate seems to be the most important parameter, with high air/water flow ratios leading to a change in flowfield at the top of the mould as the gas buoyancy lifts the SEN jet towards the surface. \r\n\r\nTo achieve a good correlation between the experiments and the simulations a number of factors in the numerics were found to be important. These are: \r\n\r\n- The quality of the mesh used, especially in the complex transition from the SEN geometry – essentially a cylinder with two outlets set at a specific angle of 20o to the vertical, to the thin rectangular geometry of the mould which is designed to cast flat products.\r\n \r\n- The turbulence model, which was initially found to suppress interface oscillations whenever an oil layer was introduced. Various approaches were followed to overcome this problem, (a)removing the turbulence model from the oil layer, (b) using a low frequency filter to remove resolved turbulence kinetic energy from the k-ε model, (c)opting for the high order SMART numerical scheme in preference to the default Hybrid. \r\n\r\n- The interface tracking algorithm used as a default in the code PHYSICA is essentially a VOF technique with options for a Van-Leer (TVD) scheme [2] or alternative the popular Donor Acceptor scheme [3,4], both options work well but they are explicit and therefore extremely expensive computationally. Due to the size of the mesh and the CFL limit for stability, timesteps as small as 10-3s become necessary, meaning a 600s simulation could take up to 8 weeks! To overcome this, the implicit CDM scheme [5] was used, which allows the interface to spread by diffusion but then pushed back against the gradient to re-sharpen at the end of each timestep. With this scheme, timesteps up to 2 orders of magnitude larger become possible, the limit then governed by the frequency range to be resolved. \r\n\r\nA non-standard approach to the Lagrangian particle tracking scheme was adopted in the simulation with the following characteristics: \r\n\r\n- The amount of gas entering was divided into packets of equal bubble diameter and then each packet was further divided into individual tracks. The transport of 1000 and more particles tracks was used to ensure a realistic dispersion. \r\n\r\n- Tracks were updated at regular time intervals (but not necessarily at each Eulerian timestep) and then followed until they exited the calculation domain.\r\n \r\n- The residence time of particles in each cell provided information for the gas content of the cell and therefore its density. With this approach, the Navier-Stokes equations then solve for mixture (gas and liquid) and lighter cells are influenced by buoyancy. \r\n\r\n- The bubble tracks are affected by the mean velocity of the surrounding fluid and also by a stochastic component derived from the turbulence model. However, there is no direct feedback to fluid turbulence from the bubbles. \r\n\r\nTo extend simulations to a real caster, heat transfer and phase change were introduced in the model, in addition to the property changes (water to steel, oil to slag, air to argon). Of importance here was the development of a solidified skin of steel on the water-cooled mould walls and also the melting of flux powder into a liquid layer on the top surface. This last component of the research was introduced to enable comparisons against plant data obtained by AMR. Of particular interest in this study was the transition from a double to a single roll recirculation in the top section of the mould, as a function of the relative quality of argon entering the SEN. The model was able to reproduce this behaviour for the cases studied. \r\n\r\nAlthough much has been done in developing this model of the continuous casting process it is evident that much more research is needed, especially in the case of a real caster. For example, the thermophysical property variations in the slag due to temperature, composition and mass transfer were ignored. A very simple approach was used for the phase change in steel and flux powder, although since the PHYSICA framework is modular, more sophisticated alternatives can be easily introduced. The boundary conditions for heat transfer remain uncertain and the values used in this study were obtained from the industrial partner from earlier experiments. \r\n\r\nIn spite the aforementioned limitations, the model is very useful, especially in understanding the dynamic interactions between the SEN jets, and the slag/steel interface and in this respect in advance of other models used by industry.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kountouriotis, Zacharias"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.360144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102651,"sim:weight":0.339956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.336385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631471,"sim:weight":0.325741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664565,"sim:weight":0.325323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269888,"sim:weight":0.319761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98555,"sim:weight":0.318991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75482,"sim:weight":0.316365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98551,"sim:weight":0.314993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98504,"sim:weight":0.314821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46104,"sim:weight":0.30546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99442,"sim:weight":0.30485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43828,"sim:weight":0.299949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387380,"sim:weight":0.29982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85558,"sim:weight":0.298853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23896,"sim:weight":0.296755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98944,"sim:weight":0.291858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17966,"sim:weight":0.285223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48331,"sim:weight":0.280355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268052,"sim:weight":0.279887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In fact, such models became also useful tools in different tasks within fire safety engineering field, such as fire risks assessment and fire investigation. However, there are some difficulties in this process when using these models. For instance, during the evacuation modeling analysis, a common problem faced by fire safety engineers concerns the number of simulations which needs to be performed. In other terms, which fire designs (i.e., scenarios) should be investigated using the evacuation models? This type of question becomes more complex when specific issues such as the optimal positioning of exits within an arbitrarily structure needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nIn the other hand, numerical optimisation techniques have been applied to a range of different fields such as structural analysis. These techniques have shown to be a powerful tool for designers, saving their time and consequently reducing costs during the process.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the emphasis, throughout this study, is to develop a methodology that enables the optimisation of fire safety analysis of structural designs. In other words, the current research was primarily intended to demonstrate and develop this combination of fire engineering tools and techniques such as the Design of Experiments (DoE) and numerical optimisation techniques. For this purpose, a Computational Fire Engineering (CFE) tool combined with Numerical Optimisation Techniques and associated statistical methods (i.e., Design of Experiments (DoE) and Response Surface Models (RSM)) are used. The study is focused on evacuation modelling; nevertheless the methodology proposed here could equally be applied to CFD-based fire simulation tools. While the approach that has been developed is intended to be generally applicable, the techniques have been explored and demonstrated using the buildingEXODUS computational package. This fire engineering simulation tool is used worldwide, to improve the fire safety in building designs.\r\n\r\nThis study therefore intended, besides to develop a numerical methodology to allow the efficient optimisation of fire safety aspects of structural designs, to understand how the core variables impact the evacuation efficiency.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a common problem faced by fire safety engineers, in the field of evacuation analysis, is the optimal positioning of exits within an arbitrarily complex structure. This problem is usually addressed through time consuming and expensive trial and error. While a solution is usually found, to this problem, it is seldom the optimal solution, resulting in a compromise in building performance and safety.\r\n\r\nThe methodology explored in this thesis, as applied to CFE, was initially based around a relatively small set of physical variables. This approach evolved and was subsequently expanded to include more complex behavioural, procedural and environmental parameters. The methodology has also been further developed and applied to evacuation simulation.\r\n\r\nThis integrated approach is intended to help fire safety engineers and designers to develop optimal designs (i.e., safe designs) in an optimised manner. In reality, this was the motivation of this study: to introduce numerical optimisation techniques and associated concepts, well known within the operational research field, as an approach for a more efficient and systematic procedure when developing and/or improving fire safety designs.\r\n\r\nPost comparisons between the outputs obtained, using these different DoE techniques, have been also performed in order to analyze which technique is most suitable for the optimisation of structural designs.\r\n\r\nThis thesis describes a number of analyses (of a variety of structural designs) that have been used to evaluate the application of optimisation techniques into the CFE context. This included the use of the buildingEXODUS simulation tool, as mentioned previously, followed by the application of a variety of optimisation techniques (both gradient and non-gradient based numerical optimisation techniques) as well as different types of DoE (such as Latin Hypercube, Central Composite Design (CCD) and also a Random approach) in order to improve the designs according to a number of different variables. These variables have initially included physical modifications to the geometry.\r\n\r\nThe proposed methodological approach developed in this thesis is demonstrated on a variety of practical problems. These problems are represented by 4 case studies which vary from complexity to the nature of the variables. These case studies involved both types of problems, namely: unconstrained and constrained.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained have shown to be satisfactory, i.e., global minima and local minima closest to the global minima region were found. For all the cases, a gradient-based algorithm (i.e., the Fletcher-Reeves numerical optimisation technique) and non gradient-based algorithm (i.e., the Particle Swarm Optimisation numerical optimisation technique) were used to find the optimal solution. And as mentioned before, different DoE techniques were also applied.\r\n\r\nImportant issues within building fire safety design were found and discussed in this thesis. For example, it was shown that the positioning of the exits can have a stronger impact on the design evacuation time rather than the exits\u0027 widths for some scenarios. Furthermore, the level of life safety for buildings should also consider the exits\u0027 locations within enclosures.\r\n\r\nThe analysis revealed that this methodology seems to be a very powerful tool for evacuation modelling analysis.\r\n\r\nThis systematic methodology to efficiently optimise evacuation safety aspects of structural designs should be also extended to more complex designs, such as larger enclosures and open spaces.\r\n\r\nThis methodology is also intended to be applied to problems found in the field of fire simulation, such as: the sizing and positioning of smoke extraction vents and the modelling of cable fires.","bibo:AuthorList":["Machado Tavares, Rodrigo"],"dc:date":"2011-05-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8932053,"sim:weight":0.186704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931240,"sim:weight":0.177657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.170882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.159556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934278,"sim:weight":0.15127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934499,"sim:weight":0.149816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.148635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106828,"sim:weight":0.147809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.140936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.14023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.140097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67390,"sim:weight":0.136221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931954,"sim:weight":0.135261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933695,"sim:weight":0.134116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338279,"sim:weight":0.133316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.133095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998017,"sim:weight":0.130477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.126836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934619,"sim:weight":0.115279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933069,"sim:weight":0.108169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":362410,"ep:Repository":51,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Computational modelling of agent based path planning and the representation of human wayfinding behaviour within egress models","bibo:abstract":"The focus of this thesis is on wayfinding within buildings from an evacuation/circulation modelling perspective. Majority of the existing evacuation models simplify the process of wayfinding by assigning the shortest path to all agents. This is not a realistic representation of the actual route choices made by people in circulation/evacuation conditions. Wayfinding is a dynamic process and cannot be modelled as a static process by assigning pre-determined routes to the agents. Wayfinding is thus a very important aspect to be modelled accurately within evacuation/circulation models to simulate more realistic human behaviour. \r\n\r\nThe main goal of this thesis is to develop an agent based wayfinding model for the buildingEXODUS evacuation/circulation model. There were four major problems to be solved: spatial representation of the environment, implementation of graph search algorithms to generate choice set of routes for the agents to choose from, determination of factors that influence people‟s wayfinding behaviour and the development/integration of the agent based wayfinding model within the buildingEXODUS evacuation/circulation model. \r\n\r\nThe existing spatial representation technique in buildingEXODUS was modified to best suit the requirement of the wayfinding model. Various graph search algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra and Yen‟s algorithm were studied. Alternate algorithms were developed to quickly generate routes and were compared with the performance of the Yen‟s algorithm. Two surveys were then developed and published on line. A total of 1200 participants from various countries took the survey. The survey results were statistically analysed and was utilised to model the decision making behaviour of the agents in the wayfinding model. An agent based wayfinding model was then developed incorporating features such as: spatial representation in terms of a graph, application of route choice set generating algorithms, agents with their individual attributes using multi criteria decision analysis methods to choose routes and changing routes dynamically on encountering congestion or gaining new exit knowledge. \r\n\r\nThis wayfinding model was then integrated within the buildingEXODUS model. The buildingEXODUS model passes spatial information and agent location to the wayfinding model at the start of the simulation. The wayfinding model applies the graph search algorithms to generate routes and assigns routes (a set of target locations) to the agents. The buildingEXODUS model generates events under certain circumstances: when agents reach a target location, encounter congestion or learn the location of a new exit. The wayfinding model listens to these events and assigns a new route to the agents if an alternate route is more favourable than the initially chosen one. Therefore, there is constant communication between the fine node buildingEXODUS and the coarse node wayfinding models, with the latter being responsible for assigning routes to the agents and the former being responsible for navigating the agents from one target location to the next. Thus, a sophisticated wayfinding model incorporating data from surveys has been developed using C++ and has been integrated into the buildingEXODUS evacuation model. \r\n\r\nThe introduction of the wayfinding model brought about significant changes to the evacuation statistics produced by the buildingEXODUS model. The difference was more significant in buildings where there was more than one path to an exit. The default option of the existing evacuation models is to assign the shortest path to all the agents in the simulation whereas with the wayfinding model, agents choose alternative paths based on other wayfinding criteria as well such as time, number of turns, etc.","bibo:AuthorList":["Veeraswamy, Anand"],"dc:date":"2011-09-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931792,"sim:weight":0.181073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997844,"sim:weight":0.177725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934856,"sim:weight":0.166438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931264,"sim:weight":0.165703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826895,"sim:weight":0.161092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933897,"sim:weight":0.15147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932184,"sim:weight":0.148071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931240,"sim:weight":0.146895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998017,"sim:weight":0.136773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930807,"sim:weight":0.134116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":38006,"sim:weight":0.130141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930875,"sim:weight":0.126548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934037,"sim:weight":0.117855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.11566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933831,"sim:weight":0.111658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933069,"sim:weight":0.111122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.10733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933335,"sim:weight":0.0976032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933163,"sim:weight":0.0907559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931241,"sim:weight":0.0895098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Through literature review and industrial investigations, it has been recognised that NPD is an information and knowledge intensive process. However, in current practice, enterprise knowledge is not properly managed or easily accessible. Many service providers have not followed the good practice of considering business objectives and end users’ requirements as main drivers of knowledge management system development and implementation.\r\n\r\nThis doctoral thesis presents a methodology for the design and development of Knowledge Management (KM) systems to support NPD based on Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (EAFs). The project focuses on IT system specifications\r\ngeneration driven by business and knowledge users’ requirements in the automotive industry. Current EAFs have been developed by researchers and practitioners to help enterprises to design their information systems based on business objectives and user requirements. However, these frameworks are mainly proposed to manage information and data such as finances, resources, management and engineering\r\ndocuments, not for the increasingly important enterprise knowledge, especially tacit and unstructured knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to extend the capabilities of the latest enterprise architecture frameworks so that not only data and information, but also enterprise knowledge can be managed. A guideline in the form of a flowchart has been developed, which provides a process that can be followed and used by system developers and implementation. The extended EAF has been implemented as easy-to-use folders for the development of a structured knowledge base. A case study in an automotive company proved that the methodology can be used to produce the functional specifications of their IT systems to include knowledge management capability. The system specification can then be used, either to assess a company’s existing information systems and direct its future system development and implementation; or to develop/implement a complete new information system from scratch.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhang, Pengcheng"],"dc:date":"2011-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":81438,"sim:weight":0.578443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.546205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.531735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.531735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.531735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.531735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.531735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.531735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.531735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.531735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.531735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.531735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.531735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.531735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.531735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.531735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81183,"sim:weight":0.528127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.526552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59232,"sim:weight":0.518915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383501,"sim:weight":0.489779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The main output of this study is the formulation of an integrated green PSC model involving all critical stakeholders, leading to improved environmental, economic and safety performance in medication management and delivery. Design/methodology/approach – The research is based on literature and on secondary resources. Findings – To green the PSC, every producer of waste is duty bound to facilitate the safe handling and disposal of waste. A cross boundary green PSC (XGPSC) approach is proposed to identify participants\u0027 contribution to the PSC. Peripheral influences are also recognised from professional and regulatory bodies. Research limitations/implications – This study focuses solely on community PSC in the UK where patients receive medication from local community pharmacies and thus may be limited. The proposed XGPSC approach also needs to be tested and validated in practice. It may also be difficult to transfer some of the environmental practices proposed in this research into practice. Practical implications – The environmental practices and actions proposed provide invaluable insight into various PSC activities, including purchasing, product design, prescription patterns and processes, medication use review, and customer relationship management. Social implications – The proposed environmental actions encourage firm commitment from everyone to reduce, recycle or effectively dispose of pharmaceutical waste, with patients becoming stewards of medication rather than only consumers. Originality/value – A cross boundary approach is developed to green the PSC, which encourages total involvement and collaboration from all participants in PSC.","bibo:AuthorList":["Xie, Ying","Breen, Liz"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664526,"sim:weight":0.278132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98863,"sim:weight":0.277419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101474,"sim:weight":0.268258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":117132,"sim:weight":0.252964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664672,"sim:weight":0.251342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86062,"sim:weight":0.245308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84647,"sim:weight":0.235016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385794,"sim:weight":0.227701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3170,"sim:weight":0.212637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98465,"sim:weight":0.184917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.183276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.183276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.183276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.183276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.183276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.183276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.183276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.183276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.183276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.183276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, one of the disadvantages of using bends in pneumatic conveyors is the wear of the bends, if the\r\nmaterial being conveyed is at all abrasive e.g. if the particles are hard and angular such as minerals, coal, ash etc. Wear also often occurs in long straight sections just after pipe joints. This wear problem is often very costly, resulting in many unplanned stoppages for repair on systems conveying these materials, as well as producing severe mess from leakage of the material after a puncture.\r\nThere are many different means of providing wear protection for bends and straight pipe sections, but they too can be costly, with the best wear resistant materials costing as much as $5000 per bend or even more to apply; and the wrong choice can lead to much wasted money if it does not give the protection hoped for. Other wear resistant solutions can severely increase the energy consumption of the conveyor, or limit its throughput, if applied too liberally. Hence it is very important to choose carefully the right means of wear protection. This paper will review the common sites and causes of conveying pipeline wear, and show that with the latest technology for characterising the erosiveness of the conveyed material, it is possible to choose a wear protection solution that will give cost-effective protection.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bradley, Michael","Farnish, Richard","Deng, Tong"],"dc:date":"2011-04-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26522,"sim:weight":0.347157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27122,"sim:weight":0.341678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98614,"sim:weight":0.207716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.166632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664921,"sim:weight":0.165575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99427,"sim:weight":0.164565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.160086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68067,"sim:weight":0.157733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.151822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.151822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.151822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.151822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.151822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.151822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.151822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.151822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.151822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.151822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.151822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.151822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Methods Qualitative in-depth interviews with 30 professionals from eight NHS maternity units in England that provide services for large proportions of women of black Caribbean, black African, Indian, Pakistani and Irish descent. Results All the professionals reported providing care to both UK-born and migrant mothers from ethnic minorities. Most of them felt that they could differentiate between UK-born and migrant mothers based mainly on language fluency and accent. ‘Westernized dress’ and ‘freedom’ were also cited as indicators. Overall, professionals found it easier to provide services to UK-born mothers and felt that their needs were more like those of white English mothers than those of migrant mothers. UK-born mothers were generally thought to be assertive and expressive, and in control of care-related decision-making whereas some South Asian Muslim women were thought to be constrained by family influences. Preconceived ideas about ethnic minority mothers\u0027 tolerance of pain in labour, use of pharmacological pain relief measures and mode of delivery were recurring themes. Women\u0027s education and social class were felt to be major influences on the uptake of maternity care, regardless of ethnicity. \r\nConclusions Professionals appeared to equate the needs of UK-born ethnic minority women with those of white English women. Overall, this has positive implications for care provision. Despite this, specific behavioural expectations and unconscious stereotypical views were evident and have the potential to affect clinical practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Puthussery, Shuby","Twamley, Katherine","Harding, Seeromanie","Mirsky, Judith","Baron, Maurina","Macfarlane, Alison"],"dc:date":"2008-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":17976,"sim:weight":0.490325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44562,"sim:weight":0.480518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.47384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383655,"sim:weight":0.472656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101412,"sim:weight":0.438123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101580,"sim:weight":0.431575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383383,"sim:weight":0.421974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340646,"sim:weight":0.403402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.403147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43687,"sim:weight":0.397331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384101,"sim:weight":0.380169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44915,"sim:weight":0.377822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.371269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56635,"sim:weight":0.354421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.352607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.352172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":341217,"sim:weight":0.346369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.346154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101268,"sim:weight":0.345847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48236,"sim:weight":0.342372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

UK-born women\u0027s familiarity with the system and the absence of language barriers were felt to be influential in getting treated the same as White women. Women stressed the need for professionals to be ‘sensitive’ and ‘delicate’ in their interactions and wanted ‘continuity of care’. In general, they were positive about the adequacy of the information given during their antenatal appointments, but some women found it difficult to get access to antenatal classes. Women valued good communication and consistent information, with their views acknowledged and their questions answered consistently. They also expressed the need for better physical environments in maternity units.

DESIGN: in-depth semi-structured interviews. PARTICIPANTS: 34 UK-born women of Black African, Black Caribbean, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Indian and Irish parentage and 30 health-care professionals.\r\nSETTING: women and health-care professionals were recruited primarily from hospitals serving large numbers of ethnic minority women in London and Birmingham.\r\nFINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: despite being aware of the benefits of exclusive breast feeding, many women chose to feed their infant with formula. The main barriers to breast feeding were the perceived difficulties of breast feeding, a family preference for formula feed, and embarrassment about breast feeding in front of others. Reports from women of South Asian parentage, particularly those who lived with an extended family, suggested that their intentions to breast feed were compromised by the context of their family life. The lack of privacy in these households and grandparental pressure appeared to be key issues. Unlike other participants, Irish women reported an intention to feed their infant with formula before giving birth. The key facilitators to breast feeding were the self-confidence and determination of women and the supportive role of health-care professionals. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: these findings point to common but also culturally specific mechanisms that may hinder both the initiation and maintenance of breast feeding in UK-born ethnic minority women. They signal potential benefits from the inclusion of family members in breast-feeding support programmes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Twamley, Katherine","Puthussery, Shuby","Harding, Seeromanie","Baron , Maurina","Macfarlane , Alison"],"dc:date":"2011-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91804,"sim:weight":0.354855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76708,"sim:weight":0.331103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74947,"sim:weight":0.326849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381933,"sim:weight":0.325175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102652,"sim:weight":0.311963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53238,"sim:weight":0.309219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108418,"sim:weight":0.291246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108836,"sim:weight":0.290474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.282783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145761,"sim:weight":0.27956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99443,"sim:weight":0.274228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.271478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383641,"sim:weight":0.267165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57213,"sim:weight":0.240561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381999,"sim:weight":0.238336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.238023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85332,"sim:weight":0.233104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931032,"sim:weight":0.231629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383621,"sim:weight":0.231605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1922491,"sim:weight":0.230347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The fact that nuclear power has not come to dominate electricity generation is seen as being due to a combination of public opposition and dealing with the safety issues raised by accidents such as those at Three Mile Island (1978), Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima (2011). The reality is that nuclear power has seldom been the cheapest option for new power stations. Worse, the real cost of any normal successful technology goes down over time due to the effect of intuitively sensible factors such as ‘learning-by-doing’, economies of scale and general technical progress. For nuclear power, these factors do not seem to have worked and for its entire commercial history, the real cost of nuclear power has only ever gone upwards. The Fukushima disaster can only give a further twist to this upward spiral. This paper examines the determinants of the cost of a kilowatt hour (kWh) of nuclear electricity; what the latest designs of nuclear power plant can offer; how new nuclear plants might be financed; and what issues will determine whether South Africa can successfully launch a new nuclear programme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thomas, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2012-03-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":88448,"sim:weight":0.779334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67306,"sim:weight":0.779292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88567,"sim:weight":0.762843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67402,"sim:weight":0.7098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88569,"sim:weight":0.65152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88491,"sim:weight":0.5837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.41167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88451,"sim:weight":0.407428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.392545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.391874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.38567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664656,"sim:weight":0.378775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.376338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.376338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.376338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.376338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.376338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.376338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.376338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.376338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In their efforts to understand the consumer, consumer behaviour researchers generally adopt a cognitive perspective, which propagates a rational, information processing approach to consumer behaviour (O’Shaughnessy and O’Shaughnessy, 2003). However, a unitary theory of consumption behaviour is undesirable because this restricts the way in which consumption behaviour can be studied (Foxall, 1990). As such, researchers need to use alternative theories in order to widen the scope of knowledge on consumer behaviour. Furthermore, within the field of consumer behaviour, emotional experience of consumers has become a prominent field of investigation. Richins (1997) concluded that the importance of emotions in consumer behaviour is well established. The question then is how researchers can attempt to understand the emotional experiences of consumers.\r\n\r\nThis research is an attempt to understand consumption emotions of consumers with specific relevance to sports consumption. It uses an alternative psychological theory,\r\npersonal construct theory, with which to understand and measure consumption emotions. Mixed methods research design is used comprising of repertory grid interviews and a quantitative survey to identify and understand the relevant emotions with regards to domestic one-day cricket spectators. The findings here show that six emotions are relevant in the cricket spectating context with most of these emotions having a strong relationship with both game experience and return intentions.\r\n\r\nThis study contributes to existing knowledge on consumption emotions by demonstrating the use of an alternative approach to both measure and study consumption emotions. By using personal construct theory, the research has helped overcome some prevalent issues within consumption emotions literature. It has shown that emotions need to be understood at an individual level. Furthermore, it has demonstrated that rationality and emotions are part of the same process and provide support for conceptualising satisfaction as an emotion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yassim, Mazia Seyed"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":387285,"sim:weight":0.529133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.480036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.460206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767834,"sim:weight":0.457646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47157,"sim:weight":0.45259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4175840,"sim:weight":0.449394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44771,"sim:weight":0.440919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.420741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8746502,"sim:weight":0.416212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761088,"sim:weight":0.414223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778976,"sim:weight":0.388052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387042,"sim:weight":0.370208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52534,"sim:weight":0.361492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176822,"sim:weight":0.35496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.353714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1138088,"sim:weight":0.349463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381997,"sim:weight":0.339963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44852,"sim:weight":0.335646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447919,"sim:weight":0.33257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.329482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I consider how Coleridge‘s continuing use of religious imagery evolved, following his transition from the established tradition of Dissenting religion, towards a more personal form of Dissent, grounded in Pantheism. \r\n\r\nChapter One considers how Coleridge‘s sonnets, lectures and periodical (The Watchman) of 1794-5 articulated his developing radical political and Dissenting religious views. Fundamental to Coleridge‘s views was a notion of the Establishment Anglican Church as a hollow Christian sham, needing a spiritually renewed form of religion to bring it back to God. \r\n\r\nChapter Two compares Religious Musings and Fears in Solitude, examining how Coleridge‘s political and religious views matured in the intervening four years. I also focus on iconic and archetypal figures featured in The Wanderings of Cain, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and Christabel. A key figure is the Wanderer, who appeared in different guises in Coleridge‘s works of this period. I also examine the protean nature of Geraldine, from Christabel, as a rare female manifestation of the Wanderer, as well as the iconic and archetypal guises of serpent, Lamia, Lilith, and succubus. \r\n\r\nChapter Three considers Coleridge‘s exploration of the relationship between power, politics, and religion, in his translation of Schiller‘s Wallenstein trilogy, through a comparison of Wallenstein and the archetypal figures of Satan and Faust. I consider how Coleridge has used the vehicle of translation as a creative space, allowing him to articulate and develop his changing religious and political opinions. The notion of translation as creation has not previously been considered. \r\n\r\nChapter Four examines Coleridge‘s influence on second-generation Romantic Period writers, specifically Mary Shelley. I discuss the evidence for Coleridge‘s influence on her novels and short stories, also drawing attention to her religious and political expression in microcosm, compared with Coleridge‘s macrocosmic political views.","bibo:AuthorList":["Beavers, Kathryn Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9552790,"sim:weight":0.605391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43273,"sim:weight":0.60445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43613,"sim:weight":0.582497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1494,"sim:weight":0.557962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44896,"sim:weight":0.550825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98899,"sim:weight":0.548362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632002,"sim:weight":0.543352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.538812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43533,"sim:weight":0.53517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48658,"sim:weight":0.529879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43171,"sim:weight":0.517943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108985,"sim:weight":0.516216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.508194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86241,"sim:weight":0.508048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382896,"sim:weight":0.504692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":651041,"sim:weight":0.503202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382067,"sim:weight":0.500877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44304,"sim:weight":0.499423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382037,"sim:weight":0.489922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44310,"sim:weight":0.487682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Through an examination of the history of the two towns and the impact of the dockyards on their inhabitants it is shown that distinctive communities evolved in these areas, with their particular version of a maritime heritage. \r\n\r\nThe dockyard workers studied here fit some but not all of the accepted theories about women’s employment, in particular that they illustrated the norms of gender-defined and very low paid work, while the differences are largely connected with their unusual position in an extremely large government organisation of longstanding, overwhelmingly dominated by male workers. Women were not employed to work alongside men in traditional dockyard crafts, but operated in specific areas. The reasons for the decisions to employ women in each case are examined, together with discussion of the developing technology associated with some of these decisions. The reasons are shown to vary, mainly between labour shortages and cost-cutting. \r\n\r\nComparisons are made between working in commercial enterprises in rope making and in a government organisation particularly through the Report of a Royal Commission and some trades union records. The key features are size, modern equipment and labour relations. \r\n\r\nInformation has been gathered about the ages, addresses and family status of some of the women, and used to assess the composition and social position of this segment of the female workforce. It is concluded that long standing beliefs that the workforce consisted only of widows and orphans were misplaced and also that the ambivalent position of these women in their communities is further evidence of the fine gradations within the working class.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ryan, Joan"],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4183638,"sim:weight":0.690464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.614188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.561236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383584,"sim:weight":0.53936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.507936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316094,"sim:weight":0.482939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316355,"sim:weight":0.481226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108857,"sim:weight":0.478904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381986,"sim:weight":0.463164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106765,"sim:weight":0.459399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46839,"sim:weight":0.450663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43473,"sim:weight":0.449342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352209,"sim:weight":0.445005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.442921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383673,"sim:weight":0.44181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382859,"sim:weight":0.441438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769042,"sim:weight":0.439026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382026,"sim:weight":0.434824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352201,"sim:weight":0.429039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383648,"sim:weight":0.429025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Mergers and acquisitions, government expenditure, capital goods export, capital goods imports (EU as the main partner of the UK trade) emerged from this investigation as influenced by the rate of profit. Mergers and acquisitions and government expenditure have not previously been considered as counteracting forces within the Marx‟s approach. \r\n\r\nThis study comprises the first use of VARs time series analysis with Granger causality tests on an analysis of the UK economy using Marxian variables. There was an early attempt by Glyn and Sutcliffe (1972) discussing about the profit squeeze, and using different measures for the rate of profit, but this did not contain any substantial econometric analysis or estimating any counteracting forces. A major obstacle in any estimation of Marxian variables is data availability and a lack of clarity and consistency in HMSO publications, and the work in this study to present consistent data in these terms will be valuable for any future research in this area. \r\n\r\nThe significance of government expenditure as a counteracting force to the tendency of the rate of profit to fall highlights the importance of unproductive capital in Marxian analysis of crisis. Government expenditure is mainly a form of unproductive capital, and therefore growth of government expenditure affects the productivity of the economy. Unproductive labour has been the focus of a lot of analysis and literature amongst the Marxist economists but not enough emphasise has been put on the role of unproductive capital. \r\n\r\nIn estimating the variables concerning the rate of profit variables and counteracting forces, I have used the money expression of value, or money terms in current prices. To justify this, I use Morishima and Seton‟s “inverse transformation” scheme to address the “transformation problem”, using input-output tables for values and prices of production, following Wolff‟s (1975) approach. The ratio of values to the prices of production was 1.02 1 for the production industries. On the basis of this approach, I then developed a computer programme by Mathematica that enabling the calculation of values and prices of production for the UK.\r\n\r\nThe study supports the view that capitalist production is a dynamic process in which the tendency of the rate of profit to fall as a form of economic crisis could find some counteracting forces to offset this tendency for a short period of time and bring about a relative stability; however, this stability does not persist forever, and crisis prevails repeatedly. This demonstrates that Marxian theory provides important insights which can address both economic crisis and growth in its theory of „the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall‟ and counteracting influences. If we forget this dialectical relationship in the Marxian theory, by over emphasising on one aspect of the argument or the other, the result is likely to be a dogmatic ideology in place of a scientific method of inquiry.","bibo:AuthorList":["Narouei, Shir Ali"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44422,"sim:weight":0.695764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394794,"sim:weight":0.655629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381952,"sim:weight":0.63291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1151649,"sim:weight":0.622952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106276,"sim:weight":0.612592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.605616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45348,"sim:weight":0.534885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.502102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46329,"sim:weight":0.502031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108856,"sim:weight":0.50034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108339,"sim:weight":0.482624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.469004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108145,"sim:weight":0.463286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45534,"sim:weight":0.459628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108033,"sim:weight":0.458672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45255,"sim:weight":0.45763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710039,"sim:weight":0.449299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.447618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107140,"sim:weight":0.446165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108857,"sim:weight":0.431862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Typically such devices provide a faster and more comfortable means to travel than the equivalent stairs. Such devices also provide an additional means for occupant egress. However, the provision for utilising such devices in actual buildings for evacuations is rare. Despite a select number of structures throughout the world allowing the use of vertical transport devices within evacuation scenarios, little is understood with regards to evacuation vertical transport strategies and to what extent such strategies may be influenced by associated human factors. This thesis is intended to address this lack of understanding. \r\n\r\nThe thesis provides an in depth review of evacuation usage of vertical transport devices in actual evacuations, their provision in building codes, empirical studies analysing human factors, representation within simulated environments, and analysis of previously explored operational strategies. The review provides a broad set of research questions that the thesis is intended to address. Human factors data associated with vertical transport device usage have been collected via an online survey and video analysis. The data analysis has instructed the development of the vertical transport device models and associated agent models within the buildingEXODUS evacuation software. The models include the representation of device selection, the influence of local conditions in close proximity to a device, and the influence of wait time upon device selection. The developed models have been used to demonstrate the influence of different vertical transport strategies and to what extent such strategies are influenced by human factors. Finally, the thesis concludes by summarising the increased understanding achieved through the work presented.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kinsey, Michael Jon."],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1393981,"sim:weight":0.428926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393934,"sim:weight":0.428842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795346,"sim:weight":0.37395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387072,"sim:weight":0.362233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795351,"sim:weight":0.311175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383609,"sim:weight":0.277494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795327,"sim:weight":0.276666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.263095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.263059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.257654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.25452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108497,"sim:weight":0.240926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.240289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931835,"sim:weight":0.239812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.237974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.235256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.235256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.235256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.235256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.235256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The framework considers not only the capabilities of product design, production, inbound logistics, and information sharing, but also the configuration of the role structure, process structure, and information structure that helps achieve these capabilities. \r\n\r\nFindings – This paper analyzes two types of modular supply network, directly reflecting the degrees of involvement in the modularity logic of the module supplier and the automaker, which largely depend on their corporate strategy toward technology innovation. In a fully integrated module supply network, the module supplier needs sufficient capability for upstream supply network integration and modularization, whereas in the partly integrated module supply network, a third-party logistics provider plays an important role with regard to production capability. \r\n\r\nResearch limitations/implications – This paper investigates four modules. The practical tools for configuring the modular supply network can be specified in more detail in further research. \r\n\r\nOriginality/value – The 3C framework described herein contributes to theory in the fields of supply chain management and modularity, and it assists in further expanding the theory of SCM.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lin, Yong","Zhou, Li","Shi, Yongjiang","Ma, Shihua",","],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Self-hypnosis involved 10 x 20min sessions of visualization of a healthy immune scenario. Trait absorption was also recorded as a possible moderator. Moderated regression indicated that both hypnosis interventions produced significantly lower tiredness ratings than relaxation when trait absorption was high. When trait absorption was low, VR resulted in significantly higher engagement ratings although this did not translate to demonstrable improvement in outcome. Results suggest that VR imagery may increase engagement relative to traditional methods, but further investigation into its potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy is required.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thompson, Trevor","Steffert, Tony","Gruzelier, John"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The lack of a voice for labour in international studies is striking.  Even in studies of social movements, there is a muted acknowledgement of the role of trade unions.  \r\n\r\nThe socio-economic security of labour makes a major contribution to overall security concerns, yet it is not widely recognised. However, there are signs that multi-lateral agencies are beginning to recognise the importance of labour standards. The International Finance Corporation recently introduced core labour standards for companies receiving its loans.  An analysis of some World Bank and other multilateral agency documents shows that there are two major approaches to labour issues emerging in international policy: labour standards and workers involvement in public services.  \r\n\r\nThis paper analyses and reflects on a research project, which was a partnership between the International Labour Office and an international trade union, Public Services International.

Current prison suicide prevention policy in England and Wales reflects the importance of peer supporters and working with outside bodies such as the Samaritans. Under the Listening scheme, a peer support system developed by the prison service and the Samaritans, selected prisoners are trained to listen in confidence to fellow prisoners experiencing psychological and emotional distress which may lead to self harm or suicide. The scheme originated in HMP Swansea in 1991 and there are now over 1200 Listeners across the prison estate.\r\nPeer support is an increasingly significant aspect of health care provision as emphasis shifts from treatment to the promotion of health and well-being. The published evidence base for the role of Listeners in the mental well-being of offenders is limited to a few small empirical studies and reviews and evaluations that have looked at the prison service suicide strategy as a whole. Furthermore, the prison population has increased dramatically in recent years and responsibility for prison health care has now been transferred from the prison service to the NHS. The aim of this research study was to investigate prisoners\u0027 willingness to use peers for emotional and psychological support, to explore the impact upon providers and recipients and to investigate prisoners’ and health care professionals’ perceptions of its effectiveness in reducing distress.\r\n\r\nMethodology: A qualitative approach in one prison has been chosen for this research to complement earlier survey based research and to enable a more in-depth investigation of perceptions and understandings. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with: six Listeners; seven prisoners who had used the Listening scheme; seven prisoners who had not used the Listening scheme; two prison officers; six health care professionals and the Samaritan Branch Prison Support Officer.\r\nIn addition to the interviews, two Listener training sessions and one Safer Custody Group meeting were observed in order to gain an understanding of the training provided by the Samaritans and the contribution Listeners make to the safer custody strategy within the prison.\r\n\r\nFindings: The local Samaritan branch enjoys an excellent relationship with the prison and the operation of the scheme is a joint project between branch volunteers and the Safer Custody Office. Whilst the number of Listeners in the prison fluctuates owing to the natural churn within the prison system, recruitment seems healthy and there are three intensive training courses every year. But the prison is perhaps particularly fortunate in having such a well-resourced and committed Samaritan branch.\r\nLevels of awareness of the scheme are high and there is a basic understanding of its aims amongst prisoners whether they use it or not. The extent of use is somewhat difficult to ascertain as official prison records of Listener call-outs do not include informal contacts and follow-ups and are therefore probably an underestimate. Prisoners who use the scheme spoke of anxiety, depression, frustration with the practicalities of life in custody and the isolation of being removed from family and friends. Health care professionals also referred to the relatively high proportion of individuals with diagnosable mental health problems within the prison system and Listeners reported that a significant number of their clients self harm. Prisoners who had not used the scheme usually felt able to deal with their own problems or had other sources of support, such as cell-mates and visits from family members. Although most research participants acknowledged that seeking help might be interpreted as a sign of weakness in a male prison, there seemed to be a far greater likelihood that prisoners would turn to their peers than to prison officers or indeed, health care professionals, who were generally seen as less understanding and less approachable. Staff workloads also meant they had limited time to spend with individual prisoners.\r\nListeners enjoyed their roles and spoke primarily of wanting to support their fellow inmates, but also the opportunity to escape the confines of their cell and pass the time in prison more quickly. They also seemed to benefit in terms of personal development. However, there are other, less altruistic reasons why a prisoner might wish to volunteer in this way including a guarantee of a six month hold before being moved to another prison and an individual cell. On the negative side, the emotional responsibility of listening to distressed prisoners and maintaining confidentiality in some of the most difficult situations can weigh heavily, although those interviewed for this study felt they generally coped well.\r\nAlthough there is good support for the scheme at an institutional level, there was some evidence that the attitude of individual prison officers could vary suggesting that early reservations about the Listening role had not been entirely eradicated. This occasionally seemed to impact upon access to the scheme if officers failed to respond to requests for a Listener. However, it should be noted that as only two prison officers were interviewed, this perception comes principally from prisoners and Listeners. Health care professionals expressed respect for the work that Listeners do, but Mental Health In-reach support workers in particular felt they needed more supervision and training in basic mental health issues.\r\nA peer support scheme within a custodial setting inevitably faces certain challenges. It can be abused by both providers and users. This did not seem to be a significant problem within the prison, but a small number of Listeners are dismissed from the scheme every year for passing drugs or mobile phones around the prison and prisoners can be refused access to Listeners if they are considered to be wasting time or becoming too dependent. Demand for Listeners is heaviest in Health Care, the Segregation Unit and in the evenings after lock-down. During the day Listeners are free to move around the prison, but at night they must be escorted. The small number of officers on duty at this time can create delays in response to call-outs, but it is difficult to see how this can be avoided and prisoners seem not to have experienced too many problems in this respect. However, Listeners do tend to be concentrated in one houseblock rather than being evenly distributed around the prison. Confidentiality is central to the Samaritan and therefore Listening philosophy, but it rests on the group rather than the individual and the Listeners did not generally have any difficulties in adhering to it. However, In-reach support workers in the prison questioned the principle in cases of potential suicide.\r\nFar more problematic was the issue of vulnerable prisoners (VPs). Application for Listener training is open to all prisoners irrespective of their index offence, but there is a great deal of prejudice against VPs usually regarded as synonymous with sex offenders. Not all trainees are happy to be trained alongside, or to be called out to, VPs. The prison has adopted a policy of VP Listeners for vulnerable prisoners, but this is dependent upon there being a sufficient number to meet the relatively high demand and does not always cover those VPs who are in Health Care or Segregation. At the time the research was being conducted, the few VP Listeners were also being denied access to group support from the Samaritan volunteers following an incident during one such session.\r\nOverall, the Listening scheme is seen to benefit the prison in a number of ways. At one level it provides a safe space in which prisoners can vent their frustrations thereby diffusing situations which might increase the volatility of the atmosphere in the prison. At another level, it provides additional support to prisoners in emotional and psychological distress and relieves the pressure on prison and health professionals. Many research participants struggled to find ways in which it could be improved, but the following suggestions were made:\r\n re-integration of the VP Listeners into the main listening group for Saturday support sessions\r\n the option for prisoners to specify the type of Listener, for example a Muslim or a younger/older Listener if required\r\n some basic mental health training for all Listeners\r\n speedier escorts back to their cells for Listeners when a call has ended\r\n a more equal distribution of Listeners across all the houseblocks\r\n hand washes for all Listeners\r\n the provision of one-to-one supervision for Listeners\r\n the ability to “book” Listeners\r\n an age restriction so that only more mature prisoners could apply to become Listeners\r\n pamphlets detailing the way the scheme works which could be pushed under each cell door.\r\n\r\nFuture Challenges: Arguably the main concern that arises from our findings is how to provide a consistent Listening service to vulnerable prisoners. There appear to be two main challenges in this area; firstly to provide sufficient resources within prison services and secondly to address the negative attitudes expressed towards this group both by some prisoners and prison staff. The current Samaritan confidentiality policy provides certainty for the Listener and prison service however some consideration should be given to integrating basic mental health awareness and knowledge into Samaritan training. Finally the Listeners are often in possession of important information and it would be beneficial to consider greater integration into the health care team but at the same time maintaining the confidentiality principle and avoiding “medicalising the service.”\r\n\r\nFuture Research: The data in the current study suggests that the Listening scheme benefits both the Listeners and the prison service. It could be argued that it is fundamental to the prison suicide and self-harm policy. However to date there have been no studies that have attempted to measure the outcomes produced by the Listener service or tease out its contribution in contrast to other important variables such as the role of other prison support services. One of the main challenges facing NHS services of all different kinds is to ensure that money is spent on evidence-based services. To this end some form of cost benefit analysis of the Listening scheme would be beneficial. Volunteers for the Samaritans do not have to opt to work with the prison Listeners. In the prison where this study was conducted the scheme was well resourced. We suggest that this leads to two future avenues for possible research: firstly to investigate the types of volunteers who wish to work with Listeners and equally importantly those who do not and secondly to examine how the Listening scheme operates in prisons where Samaritan resources are stretched to support the service.\r\n\r\nConclusions: From the perspective of virtually all those who participated in this research - the Safer Custody office, health care professionals, prisoners, Listeners and Samaritans - this is a Listening scheme that works well. The Samaritan volunteers were universally praised for their commitment and enthusiasm and there was evidence of a strong and positive relationship between them and the prison. Most prisoners who had used the scheme spoke highly of their experiences and greatly appreciated the support it provided. The Listeners themselves derived a great deal of satisfaction from their work and thought they also benefited in terms of personal development. A few tensions were highlighted between them and prison staff, but this did not appear to be a significant problem and their individual relationships with health care professionals seemed to be based on mutual respect and trust. However, by its very nature, the scheme does present certain challenges and these still have to be addressed even in the more successful examples. In this prison, these seem to centre on the integration of VPs into the Listening scheme and the need to extend the Samaritan’s obviously strong relationship with the prison authorities to Health Care and possibly other areas of support such as the Chaplaincy. A closer working relationship with In-reach services in particular might facilitate better support and training for the Listeners and a clearer understanding of the way the principle of confidentiality is interpreted in the prison. In terms of best practice, there is much to be learnt from the way the scheme operates in this prison. However, it seems unlikely that all prisons enjoy the advantages of such a well-resourced and motivated local Samaritan branch. This only serves to emphasise the importance of effective management and co-ordination in the implementation of any peer support programme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Foster, John","Magee, Helen"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108022,"sim:weight":0.615872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100543,"sim:weight":0.450708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.431583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108300,"sim:weight":0.413174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.40882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.403592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27201,"sim:weight":0.382719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108429,"sim:weight":0.355752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53847,"sim:weight":0.344558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.328051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108956,"sim:weight":0.321176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.311954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108962,"sim:weight":0.27094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This involves the creation of virtual machines, decompression of the operating system image, adapting the virtual environment\r\nto satisfy software requirements of the job, constant update of the job state once it’s running with out modifying batch system or existing grid middleware, and finally bringing the host machine back to a consistent state.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this research, an existing and in production pilot job framework has been modified to deploy virtual machines on demand on the grid using virtualization administrative domain to handle all I/O to increase network throughput. This approach limits the change impact on the existing grid infrastructure while leveraging the execution\r\nand performance isolation capabilities of virtualization for job execution. This work led to evaluation of various scheduling strategies used by the Xen hypervisor to measure the sensitivity of job performance to the amount of CPU and memory allocated under various configurations.\r\n\r\nHowever, virtualization overhead is also a critical factor in determining job execution times. Grid jobs have a diverse set of requirements for machine resources such as CPU, Memory, Network and have inter-dependencies on other jobs in meeting their deadlines since the input of one job can be the output from the previous job. A novel resource provisioning model was devised to decrease the impact of virtualization overhead on job execution.\r\n\r\nFinally, dynamic deadline-aware optimization algorithms were introduced using exponential smoothing and rate limiting to predict job failure rates based on static and dynamic virtualization overhead. Statistical techniques were also integrated into the optimization algorithm to flag jobs that are at risk to miss their deadlines, and taking preventive action to increase overall job throughput.","bibo:AuthorList":["Khalid, Omer"],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5834849,"sim:weight":0.527526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2700697,"sim:weight":0.523308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931668,"sim:weight":0.516635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1003888,"sim:weight":0.516255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":765331,"sim:weight":0.51485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":889405,"sim:weight":0.51023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386709,"sim:weight":0.505566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931552,"sim:weight":0.497762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5834781,"sim:weight":0.49472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145901,"sim:weight":0.493673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931598,"sim:weight":0.493283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":901553,"sim:weight":0.492962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2702003,"sim:weight":0.48647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":888213,"sim:weight":0.485747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1024024,"sim:weight":0.481744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1015762,"sim:weight":0.480736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":972958,"sim:weight":0.478042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":973894,"sim:weight":0.474347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":79585,"sim:weight":0.473932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5828111,"sim:weight":0.472176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

From World War II, the funding of UK higher education has predominantly come from central government spending with a strong central framework of policy and governance. Since the 1960s, the higher education sector has grown dramatically, both in terms of student numbers and the number of institutions, much of this as a direct result of central government intervention. The law, as with the rest of the UK economy, has played a very limited role in defining the relationship between higher education employers and unions and bargaining arrangements are largely based on voluntary agreements between the two parties.

This explains why biphenyls are widely encountered in medicinal chemistry as a privileged scaffold. The palladium-catalysed Suzuki-Miyaura (SM) coupling is one of the most important and efficient strategies for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical biaryl compounds; the arylboronic acid or ester is a key partner in this coupling reaction.\r\nThis work presents the synthesis of a library of new molecules containing the biphenyl scaffold; o-, m- and p-(bromomethyl)phenylboronic acid pinacol esters, 2a-c, were selected as coupling partners. Nucleophilic substitution of the bromide was carried out with amine, thiol, alcohol or phenol nucleophiles. Supported reagents and microwave assisted organic synthesis conditions were employed to enhance this chemistry and made it amenable to parallel synthesis. The resulting arylboronates were used in SM coupling reactions in order to obtain a range of biphenyls.\r\nThe use of Boc-piperazine as a nucleophile in the SN2 reaction, with 2a-c, and 1-bromo-, 2-, 3- or 4-nitrobenzene or 2-bromo-5-nitropyridine as aryl halides in the SM coupling reaction, allowed two other points of functionalisation to be added to the biaryl motif.\r\nThe conditions for the SM coupling of mercaptomethylphenylboronic esters and orthosubstituted methylphenylboronic esters were optimised in order to broaden the scope of the biaryl library.\r\nPhosphines were found to be good nucleophiles in the SN2 reaction with 2a-c. A Wittig reaction was performed with the resulting phosphonium arylboronates in order to synthesise arylboronic esters containing an alkene function prior the reduction of the resulting double bond of the stilbene derivatives and realising a SM coupling to synthesise arylethylbiphenyls.\r\nThe stilbene derivatives were also synthesised by using the olefin cross-metathesis reaction of 4-vinylphenylboronic acid pinacol ester.\r\nA solid state crystallographic study was undertaken on a small library of methylbiphenylamides to compare the crystal structures of isomers or biphenyls with different functional groups.","bibo:AuthorList":["Baltus, Christine B."],"dc:date":"2011-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5854051,"sim:weight":0.662944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269874,"sim:weight":0.614196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385344,"sim:weight":0.583115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99125,"sim:weight":0.566749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25857,"sim:weight":0.543879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":869239,"sim:weight":0.538175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586415,"sim:weight":0.536451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56462,"sim:weight":0.535922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46874,"sim:weight":0.534235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5854056,"sim:weight":0.505154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709933,"sim:weight":0.489871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709944,"sim:weight":0.476697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":873895,"sim:weight":0.473556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145744,"sim:weight":0.471787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25863,"sim:weight":0.465994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1004363,"sim:weight":0.465649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1040556,"sim:weight":0.465355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":590779,"sim:weight":0.462988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709916,"sim:weight":0.4589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734369,"sim:weight":0.449152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Some of the key contributions and\r\nworks of this research thesis are: 1. A computationally simple Adaptive Minimum Mean Square Error Multiuser Detection scheme was proposed to eliminate multiple\r\naccess interference in uplink communication of an asynchronous cooperative CDMA wireless network, where users cooperate in a relaying mode while they exchange data\r\nand channel information with the destination node. The proposed scheme provides better interference resistance than optimum multiuser detection Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation in cooperative wireless networks. The performance was examined under Amplify-and-Forward and Decode-and-Forward cooperative protocols in flat fading Rayleigh wireless channels. 2. Adaptive signal combining was proposed for cooperative wireless networks and its performance was analysed by using Least Mean Square and Recursive Least Square algorithms. The other classical non-adaptive techniques Maximal Ratio Combining and Wiener were also examined.\r\nIt was also shown that adaptive signal combining achieves Wiener\u0027s solution in cooperative wireless networks with added benefit of computational simplicity over classical combining schemes. 3. Weighted Least Square Error Method of signal combining was proposed for wireless signal combining, where estimates of inverse of the channel noise variance was used as weight of the combiner. The proposed method was a receiver with noise estimation filters at each received branch for the noise estimation. The reciprocal of the estimate of the channels noise variance were used as weights of combiner to achieve Wiener’s solution of signal  combining. The proposed algorithm was used in cooperative, non cooperative wireless networks and multiple antennas system.

An extensive investigation into which partitioning strategy to employ with the parallel version of the software was researched so as to maximise its performance.\r\n\r\nThe use of evacuation modelling is well established as part of building design to ensure buildings meet performance based safety and comfort criteria (such as the placements of windows or stairs so as to ease people‘s comfort) . A novel approach to using evacuation modelling is during live evacuations from various disasters. Disasters may be fast developing in large areas and incident commanders can use the model to plan safe escape routes to avoid danger areas. For this type of usage, very fast results must be obtainable in order for the incident commanders to optimise the evacuation plan along with the software‘s capability to simulate large-scale evacuation scenarios.\r\n\r\nbuildingEXODUS provides very fast results for small-scale cases but struggles to give quick results for large-scale simulations. In addition, the loading up of large-scale cases are dependent on the specifications of the processor used thus making the problem case unscalable. A solution to address these shortcomings is the use of parallel computing. Large-scale cases can be partitioned and run by a network of processors, thus reducing the running time of the simulations as well as the ability to represent a large geometry by loading parts of the domain on each processor. This scheme was attempted and buildingEXODUS was successfully parallelised to cope with large-scale evacuation simulations.\r\n\r\nVarious partitioning methods were attempted and due to the stochastic nature of every evacuation scenario, no definite partitioning strategy could be found. The efficiency values ranged from 230% (with both cores being used from 10 dual-core processors) when an idealised case was run to 23% for another test case. The results obtained were highly dependent on the test case‘s geometry, the scenario being applied, whether all the cores are being used in case of multi-cores processors, as well as the partitioning method used.\r\n\r\nHowever, the use of any partitioning method will produce an improvement from running the case in serial. On the other hand, the speedups obtained were not scalable to warrant the adoption of any particular partitioning method. The dominant criteria inhibiting the parallel system was processor idleness or overload rather than communication costs, thus degrading the performance of the parallel system. Hence an intelligent partition strategy was devised, which dynamically assesses the current situation of the parallel system and repartitions the problem accordingly to prevent processor idleness and overloading. A dynamic load reallocation method was implemented within the parallelised buildingEXODUS to cater for any degradation of the parallel system. At its best, the dynamic reallocation strategy produced an efficiency value of 93.55% and a value of 36.81% at its worse.\r\n\r\nAs a direct comparison to the static partitioning strategy, an improvement was observed in most cases run. A maximum improvement of 96.48% was achieved from using the dynamic reallocation strategy compared to using a static partitioning approach. Hence the parallelisation of the buildingEXODUS evacuation software was successfully implemented with most cases achieving encouraging speedup values when a dynamic repartitioning strategy was employed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mohedeen, Bibi Yasmina Yashanaz"],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2795346,"sim:weight":0.461071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":757072,"sim:weight":0.441337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929808,"sim:weight":0.420234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2681237,"sim:weight":0.408075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.404527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1651709,"sim:weight":0.402633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4892811,"sim:weight":0.397504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998374,"sim:weight":0.383433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795351,"sim:weight":0.373125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":948918,"sim:weight":0.373052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183000,"sim:weight":0.368911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":757516,"sim:weight":0.366795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":948864,"sim:weight":0.345252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":844791,"sim:weight":0.343208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1008800,"sim:weight":0.337091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":972939,"sim:weight":0.336568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":765772,"sim:weight":0.33585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1116450,"sim:weight":0.334596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932238,"sim:weight":0.328062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2700497,"sim:weight":0.328001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study investigates the development of a novel approach to surface analysis of drug polymorphs, with the aim of extending the capabilities of this approach to perform real time analysis of polymorphic transformation during pharmaceutical product development.\r\n\r\nThis was achieved here, using diffuse reflectance visible spectroscopy (DRVS) and the colour change which occurs when pH indicator dyes are deposited on the surface. The pH indicators used were phenol red (PR), thymol blue (TB) and methyl red (MR). Two polymorphs each of indomethacin (IMC), carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine (CFN), sulfanilamide (SFN) and furosemide (FRS) were examined. The interaction of the adsorbed dye with each of the polymorphs showed different behaviour, manifested by different colours. An analysis of the crystal structures and the acid/base properties of the drug molecules provided a rationalisation for the different colours exhibited by the polymorphs‘ surfaces. The least stable form of each polymorphic pair studied showed more extensive interaction with the adsorbed dye molecules. Observed colour reveal underlying differences at a molecular level between the surfaces of pairs of polymorphs.\r\n\r\nThe different colours exhibited by the indomethacin polymorphs were further examined using hygroscopicity studies, contact angle measurements and computer simulation. The contact angles of several liquids with the polymorph surface were measured in order to characterise the nature of the functional groups exposed on the surface of the polymorphs. The surface structure and external morphologies of polymorphs were predicted by molecular modelling using the attachment energy model. The predicted morphology was confirmed by scanning electron micrographs (SEM) and the miller index of the dominant face was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Results revealed that although the surfaces of both polymorphs are largely hydrophobic, the metastable form- IMC-α has a greater number of polar functional groups on the surface.\r\n\r\nFurther measurements were carried out using DRVS and adsorbed TB to study the kinetics of the solid-state transformation of SFN- to SFN-. The rate of transformation was followed at 128ºC by monitoring the ratio of the two DRVS bands at 454 nm and 604 nm. The kinetic data was analysed using sixteen solid-state kinetic models to obtain the best fit. The thermally induced polymorphic transformation of the SFN-β (particle size of ≥ 450μm) can be best described by the first order kinetic model (R2 \u003d 0.992) with a rate constant, k of 2.43 x 102 s-1.

It examines how learning disability nurses care for terminally ill people with profound learning disabilities in two National Health Service residential homes. The aim of the study is to explore the perceived knowledge and skills of this group of nurses. It concerns how they assess, recognise and discover patients’ illnesses and how they provide end of life care needs. A total of 36 learning disability nurses participated in in-depth interviews. \r\n\r\nThematic analysis is achieved through analysis of interview transcripts and reflexive journaling (field notes). The analysis of data suggests that the main theme “longitudinal knowing” leads to the production of “knowing the patient well”. “Longitudinal knowing” is the principal process through which the “normal” and the “pathological” continuum is constructed. The observed changes help learning disability nurses to establish a clear demarcation between learning disability-related behaviour and disease-related behaviour. The strategy of “longitudinal knowing” the patient well helps learning disability nurses to understand what their patients are like before the illness, and after the onset of illness. In addition, this thesis reveals that learning disability nurses draw on different types of knowledge. This knowledge includes “intuition”, “commonsense” knowledge and “formal” knowledge. The analysis of data shows that the four types of knowledge derive from “longitudinal knowing”. They help learning disability nurses to understand and assess patient’s changing health conditions. These types of knowledge serve as tools to help learning disability nurses make appropriate nursing decisions about a patient’s health status. In this study, participants sometimes used a mixture of lay and technical language to describe their observed signs and symptoms.\r\nThe analysis of data shows an area of “uncertainty of knowing”. It concerns an ambiguity about whether the specific signs and symptoms are attributed to the learning disability or to an illness. “Uncertainty of knowing” may be a potential barrier to the delivery of appropriate comfort care. \r\n\r\nThe thesis also reveals an area of “certainty of not knowing”. This refers to moments when participants know for sure where the gaps in knowledge are. The analysis of data shows that participants seek to address this gap by searching for relevant internet resources. They also know that they need educational input in pathophysiology of advance diseases. This helps to reduce the tension created by “uncertainty of knowing” and comfort care. The thesis shows that for all participants, “longitudinal knowing” is fundamental for learning disability nurses in the delivery of appropriate and timely “comfort” end-of-life care.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ng, Julie Siew Wan"],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.622674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18839,"sim:weight":0.609765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61005,"sim:weight":0.589244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101268,"sim:weight":0.584154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103020,"sim:weight":0.571828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316088,"sim:weight":0.532718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68435,"sim:weight":0.51998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":837670,"sim:weight":0.503214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795344,"sim:weight":0.502201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6251,"sim:weight":0.491278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":773399,"sim:weight":0.483697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.476615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":374259,"sim:weight":0.466685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68343,"sim:weight":0.460783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3181,"sim:weight":0.457418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71311,"sim:weight":0.457399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.454581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351114,"sim:weight":0.442894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9052182,"sim:weight":0.442021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41929,"sim:weight":0.434564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The results of these studies were referenced to the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) values for 6 to 9 months old children, and a listing of the entire daily intake of nutrients was composed taking into consideration the nutrient and energy intake from milk consumption in order to (1) accurately estimate the daily intake of these nutrients derived from commercial infant food consumption, and (2) ascertain their nutritional suitability relative to dietary guidelines for the 6-9 month age group. The only significant difference found between different product varieties (meat and vegetable-based) was with respect to the protein content (p \u003d 0.04) per 100 g of food. The experimentally determined concentrations of macronutrients (g/100 kcal) were compared to the declared values provided by the manufacturers on the product labels and, despite some variations, the values obtained comply with regulatory requirements (Commission Directive 2006/125/EC). The total daily intake of fat (27.0 g/day), based on the menu composed from commercial complementary food, is suggested to exceed the Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for fat (31%), if the intake of snacks and desserts are incorporated. The aforementioned results imply that the formulations of the recipes, based on a standard commercial menu, are of significant importance in relation to the nutritional quality of the diet of infants.\r\nIn terms of elemental analysis, the concentrations of up to twenty (essential and non-essential) elements in a selected range of sixteen different products representing meat, poultry, fish and vegetable base varieties were established by ICP-OES and ICP-MS. Six major essential elements, namely: calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc were measured by ICP-OES. The concentrations of six essential trace elements (selenium, molybdenum, cobalt, copper, chromium, manganese) and eight non-essential, potentially toxic, elements (arsenic, barium, nickel, cadmium, antimony, lead, mercury, aluminium) in chicken and fish-based varieties were determined by ICP-MS due to the higher sensitivity required.\r\nBased on the results of elemental analysis, there was also some evidence of a lack of attention to micro-nutrient interactions in food. With reference to the guidelines, the RNI values for 6 to 9 month olds, all samples provided less than 20% of RNI values except for potassium (20%). In terms of the risk of exposure to toxicity, the concentration of non-essential elements in ready to feed products analysed were not considered to be of concern.\r\nWith regard to the analyses of vitamins, a novel assay for the simultaneous quantitative determination of riboflavin (B2) and pyridoxine (B6) has been developed. The method involves a mild hydrolysis step, extraction of the supernatant by centrifugation followed by quantitative analysis using UHPLC. Separation of the two water soluble vitamins achieved is excellent and rapid - within one minute whilst the resultant sample is also LC-MS compatible.\r\nWith respect to vitamin B analyses, despite wide individual differences between brands (p \u003d 6.5e-12), no significant differences were observed in the levels of vitamin B6 between the meat and vegetable-based varieties (p \u003d 0.7) per 100 g of commercial infant food. Vitamin B2 was not detected in any of the samples, where the detection limit was below 0.07μg/mL. In terms of the RNI of vitamin B6 for 6 - 9 month old infants, the complementary infant meal products analysed herein provided less than 15% of the RNI values with mean (SD) values of 12.87 (±4.46) % and 13.88 (±4.97) % for the meat- and vegetable-based recipes, respectively. The estimated total daily intake of vitamins B2 and B6 from the consumption of commercial complementary food was found to be satisfactory and in accordance with the DRVs. The intake of both vitamin B2 and B6 was estimated to be mainly derived from the consumption of formula milk which could be a cause of concern if the quality of an infant‘s milk diet is compromised by an inadequate or lack of supplemented milk intake. All the foregoing results suggest that commercial complementary infant foods on the UK market may not contain minimum levels of micronutrients required for labelling declaration of micronutrient content (Commission Directive 2006/125/EC).\r\nAn attempt, therefore, was made to optimise the formulated version of the meat based infant food as a baseline and measure the post-process retention of its nutrient content after being subjected to different processing condition in terms of a combination of temperature and time. This was achieved by quantitative analysis of the post-process values of the nutrients in the optimised formula using the aforementioned analytical techniques. The results of this study indicates that careful formulation of the recipes, in the context of new product development, is important; the selection of high quality ingredients and the ratios in which they are used have a direct effect on the nutrient content of the final product. It also indicates that a carefully controlled temperature-time combination, pH, pressure and macroscopic conditions of processing (e.g. controlled leaching) are very important in reducing heat loss and improving the nutritional quality of the food product. This provides opportunities and scope for product optimisation, of ready to eat to eat infant foods, in order to improve their nutritional value.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zand Fard, Nazanin"],"dc:date":"2011-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.567742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99761,"sim:weight":0.529731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77035,"sim:weight":0.503787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76455,"sim:weight":0.502661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5091446,"sim:weight":0.487601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24544,"sim:weight":0.479521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1041782,"sim:weight":0.470821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":860470,"sim:weight":0.455313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929822,"sim:weight":0.452684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":821959,"sim:weight":0.448149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5065527,"sim:weight":0.447979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155325,"sim:weight":0.441338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158012,"sim:weight":0.43737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5067466,"sim:weight":0.436234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":777282,"sim:weight":0.431562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50150,"sim:weight":0.419133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.415839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.415839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":836524,"sim:weight":0.406114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5067537,"sim:weight":0.403065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Ratooning is the practice of stimulating tillering by cutting the old straw after harvest (Doggett, 1988). A six season on-station experiment in Machakos District showed the practice of ratooning short duration sorghum increased the reliability and yields in comparison to a direct sown with yield ranges of 1630-1778kg/ha and 0-148kg/ha, respectively. The higher number\r\nof heads and stems per unit area meant the ratooned crop had higher level of stem borers per unit area than the direct sown crop and when infected with covered kernel smut was a greater source of inoculum. Unlike the incidence of CKS, the number of stem borers had little correlation with the numbers in the previous season’s crop; there was no upward trend to the number of stem borers per stem during the experiment suggesting factors other than the presence of a sorghum crop have a stronger influence on the population. Yield loss was an interaction between cultivar*incidence of stem borers * stage of infestation * rain quantity and distribution, but rain was the most important\r\nfactor. An on-station trial in Kitui (2001-2) found the ratooned crop outperformed the direct sown crop in yield by a factor of three and non-cutting of stems produced a similar yield to cutting back stems after harvest. The different ‘ratoon’ methods did not significantly affect the incidence of covered kernel smut or level of stem borers. \r\nOn-farm trials in Mwingi District (2000-2) showed that short duration sorghum ratooned outperformed direct sown sorghum. The timing of the cutting back of the stems had an effect on plant survival and yield; cutting back stems at harvest produced higher yields than cutting the stems at the on-set of rains, however cutting the stems at the onset of rains increased plant survival when the stems were dry at harvest. A decision tree was produced outlining the decisions a farmer needs to make when deciding whether or not to practice ratooning. Four factors were identified as important for varieties to perform well under the practice of ratooning: drought tolerance, stem\r\nstrength, non-senescence and the ability to produce tillers during growth stage 3.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilson, K.S.L"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.398108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.398108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5849296,"sim:weight":0.376448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":836446,"sim:weight":0.360208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":655847,"sim:weight":0.350758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":554639,"sim:weight":0.350421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316337,"sim:weight":0.327973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48781,"sim:weight":0.318131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":815181,"sim:weight":0.30418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8794440,"sim:weight":0.301505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382571,"sim:weight":0.298337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":851730,"sim:weight":0.297207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":555442,"sim:weight":0.287429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":607185,"sim:weight":0.284082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":504217,"sim:weight":0.281323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2684437,"sim:weight":0.278393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":814833,"sim:weight":0.273769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18949,"sim:weight":0.272969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2835560,"sim:weight":0.272969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":566614,"sim:weight":0.271122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The risk analysis methodology integrates different computational approaches for process and product analysis, including the reduced order modelling using design of experiments, risk analysis using sampling-based and analytical methods and optimisation techniques.\r\nThe integrated risk analysis and optimisation methodology is applied to two applications: (1) the FIB sputtering process control, and (2) a flip chip design. Three different FIB processes using different ion sources were investigated in order to evaluate their process performance with respects to different process parameter uncertainties. A critical comparison of the process capability against the specification limits of different processes was studied.\r\nAs parts of the research, a new modified computational model is developed for a material sputtering process using focused ion beam (FIB). This model allows the analysis of micro- and nano-structures shape with the FIB machine controlled through multiple beam scans and different beam overlapping. The FIB model related studies also address the modelling requirements for including material re-deposition effects that occur during FIB milling. The model has been validated using an experimental test case.\r\nGood agreement is observed between the analytical shape using the model and the actual experiment. The validated model enhances the accuracy of the dwell time prediction. This approach overcomes the dependence of a trial-and-error approach of the process control in nano-manufacturing industry. The proposed methodology is also used to address a design problem of a flip chip design. A novel method for the evaluation of the environmental impact of the flip chip\r\ndesign in a multi-disciplinary optimisation problem is proposed. The goal is to address materials constraints due to environmental regulations and to handle different types of requirements such as the reliability and cost. An optimal flip chip design reliability function is identified. The approach allows electronics manufacturers to consider the environmental impact amongst different design alternatives at an early stage of the design of the product before any real prototyping in order to reduce the total manufacturing life cycle.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tang, Ying Kit"],"dc:date":"2012-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":765657,"sim:weight":0.534818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.467789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":926085,"sim:weight":0.455146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12495,"sim:weight":0.430712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":766711,"sim:weight":0.429204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58759,"sim:weight":0.414183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":766266,"sim:weight":0.399935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":584850,"sim:weight":0.387267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26015,"sim:weight":0.385411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":919336,"sim:weight":0.384453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":724841,"sim:weight":0.375796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.375347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":755855,"sim:weight":0.371359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":926104,"sim:weight":0.370381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2681350,"sim:weight":0.368824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5827122,"sim:weight":0.366818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997938,"sim:weight":0.357416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60481,"sim:weight":0.357302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933083,"sim:weight":0.356927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932647,"sim:weight":0.354477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using Multifactor asset pricing theory, I test whether industry concentration is a new asset pricing factor in addition to conventional risk factors such as beta, size, book-to-market equity, momentum, and leverage. I find that industry concentration is negatively related to average stock returns in all Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions, even after controlling for beta, size, book-to-market equity, momentum, and leverage. In addition, there is strong evidence of a growth effect. Firms or industry portfolios with smaller book-to-market equity ratios have significantly higher returns. In contrast, beta is never statistically significant. The above results are robust to firm- and industry-level regressions, and the formation of firms into 100 size-beta portfolios. The time-series results show some evidence that industry concentration premium contains separate information compared with other risk premiums or risk factors and helps explain the time-series variation in stock returns, even after accounting for the premiums of beta, size, book-to-market, momentum, and leverage. The empirical findings indicate that competitive industries earn, on average, higher risk-adjusted returns than concentrated industries. An explanation is that investors in more competitive industries require larger return premiums for greater distress risks associated with these industries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hashem, Nawar"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383556,"sim:weight":0.616263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109097,"sim:weight":0.610772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185144,"sim:weight":0.551803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108576,"sim:weight":0.540978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1001684,"sim:weight":0.527347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15237,"sim:weight":0.519529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108940,"sim:weight":0.492929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43538,"sim:weight":0.469621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448006,"sim:weight":0.46927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108264,"sim:weight":0.463478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109027,"sim:weight":0.461519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.435274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85602,"sim:weight":0.424589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5223001,"sim:weight":0.417869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107047,"sim:weight":0.405158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45192,"sim:weight":0.400722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85519,"sim:weight":0.382749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108511,"sim:weight":0.372284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664724,"sim:weight":0.362304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85424,"sim:weight":0.356104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Its properties are similar to those of fossil diesel fuel, thus allowing its use in diesel engines both pure and in mixtures with fossil diesel fuel. Biodiesel is obtained from vegetable oils or animal fats by a transesterification reaction whereby the triglycerides, contained in the oil or fat, react with a short chain alcohol in the presence of a catalyst.\r\nThe products of the reaction are fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) and glycerol, obtained as two separate phases. However, current reaction efficiency using a homogeneous catalyst, such as sodium hydroxide, has various drawbacks. These include non-specificity leading to saponification, difficulty in isolating the catalyst from the fatty acid methyl esters, immiscibility of the catalyst with the reactants and incomplete transesterification.\r\nThe aim of the research reported in this thesis is to provide a full description of the transesterification reaction. According to previously published methodologies, the transesterification of glycerol trioleate with sodium hydroxide should provide 97-98 % (w/w) conversion to the ester. However, the results reported, herein, indicated only 95.2% (w/w) ester content. To understand the differences in the results, the concentrations of sodium hydroxide and methanol were varied by using unrefined rapeseed oil. Results showed that the optimum reaction conditions to produce higher ester content (93.3% w/w) from unrefined rapeseed oil i.e. molar ratio of methanol/oil was 6:1 and 0.015 mol of sodium hydroxide at 60 min. The same results were obtained with various plants oils of different origin under similar reaction conditions, but no\r\nincrease in the ester content was observed. The data suggested that the results were in accord with biodiesel specifications i.e. EN ISO 12937 and EN 14104. However, EN 14103 standard could not be met, perhaps due to the reversible nature of the reaction, higher acid value in the oil and other competing reactions of the triglycerides. It was not possible to achieve the ester content (%) according to EN 14103 standard if any moisture or free fatty acid was present in the oil or during the reaction.\r\nThe failure to meet the required EN 14103 standards by using homogeneous catalytic systems paved the way for kinetics studies of the transesterification reaction. Heterogeneous catalysts offered the opportunity to study the reaction kinetics of the system because they can be separated rapidly from the reaction mixture by centrifugation. Various heterogeneous metal oxide catalysts were investigated. Strontium oxide was confirmed to be an effective catalyst but, contrary to expectations, similar catalytic activity was not observed for the other metal oxides. The experimental results obtained, by optimising reaction conditions using a heterogeneous catalyst were found to be 3% (w/w) SrO, 6:1 CH3OH/oil molar ratio at 120 min. Therefore, subsequent reactions were planned to carry out real-time kinetic studies using SrO as a catalyst. The application of refractometry allowed real-time kinetic studies of the transesterification reaction. The ester content obtained after transesterification were determined by gas chromatography and validated the results obtained by the refractometer method. This analytical method helped to improve the reaction conditions from 120 min to 90 min using 3% (w/w) SrO and 6:1 CH3OH/oil molar ratio to achieve 92% (w/w) ester content.\r\nDuring kinetic studies, using a heterogeneous catalyst, solubility issues were observed between oil, methanol and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Therefore, a phase solubility diagram was plotted to identify the miscible region. The transesterification reaction was conducted in the miscible region of a ternary phase diagram to overcome the phase limitation problems. The ester content obtained was higher than 98% (w/w) within 25-30 min depending on the concentration (% v/v) ratio of the reactants used. These results were encouraging in terms of using a heterogeneous catalyst since its use is limited to lower ester content (%) and longer reaction time.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hamid, Samiyah"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5851042,"sim:weight":0.673111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":950189,"sim:weight":0.664943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":873458,"sim:weight":0.64445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":976106,"sim:weight":0.636507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":765746,"sim:weight":0.626673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5690080,"sim:weight":0.608902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":973396,"sim:weight":0.582927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1114809,"sim:weight":0.576628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":675651,"sim:weight":0.576386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631396,"sim:weight":0.574812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2672110,"sim:weight":0.572149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":615803,"sim:weight":0.571956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":766773,"sim:weight":0.567586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":765756,"sim:weight":0.565312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":759614,"sim:weight":0.564965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":871475,"sim:weight":0.564489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":800151,"sim:weight":0.561716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5850747,"sim:weight":0.560515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":920634,"sim:weight":0.550118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631264,"sim:weight":0.547951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Detachment of flavouring powders from products during handling and production stages can lead to poor appearance and reduced taste of the product as well as substantial financial losses for the industry, in terms of variable flavour performance and extended cleaning down time of fugitive particle build-up on process equipment. Understanding the adhesion strength of applied bulk particulates used for flavouring formulations will help analysts to evaluate the efficiency of coating processes and potentially enable them to assess the adhesion\r\nstrength of newly formulated flavouring powder prior to commitment to full scale plant trials.\r\nMeeting this object has required the development of an over-arching review of the adhesion mechanisms as a primary step. Based on this overview to the work of previous researchers, technological gaps and promising techniques have been identified for further research and development. A prototype of a novel adhesion tester called an Impact Adhesion Tester (IAT) has been designed and constructed. The development of the overall tester design is presented, and details of its parts and the resulting tester are discussed.\r\nThe IAT and its experimental procedure were primarily designed and implemented for use in the snack industry, in particular, for the measurement and evaluation of the key factors affecting the adhesion behaviour of flavour powder onto snack surfaces qualitatively and quantitatively. This measurement can indicate the percent flavour powder loss within production stages (from coating to packing) and in package. \r\nThe instrument has been evaluated using different materials and substrates subjected to different coating conditions such as rotational speed of the drum, retention time in drum, the amount of surface oil and the amount of powder applied. By plotting the detachment versus impact force, the difference has been obtained between adhesion strength of different flavouring powders (which is a strong function of particle size, particle shape, particle density and surface oil content of the snack). In addition to the above work, ultra-centrifuge method was used as a reference for comparison.\r\nThe research work conducted using IAT on flavouring powders has proved the importance of particle adhesion strength and that the particle adhesion strength can reflect the changes in particle loss, based on particle characteristics as well as process conditions during snack production. It proved that bench size IAT would be a useful tester to measure adhesion strength of particles. The results obtained from experiments have confirmed that the tester may be able to usefully determine the variations between different powder materials. However the tester needs to be further evaluated by industrialists and researchers before possible use or commercialisation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ermis, Ertan"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316120,"sim:weight":0.478981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108521,"sim:weight":0.100522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Three types of training\r\ncourse are the focus for the study; as the thesis will look at whether or not the confidence levels of trade union representatives differ depending on the type and delivery method of the course they attend and whether or not this will have an impact on their post-course behaviour in the workplace.\r\nA research tool (questionnaire) was developed to measure the responses of participants attending courses and the results compared using Chi-square statistical tests to consider any results that were of statistical significance.\r\nThe study concludes that statistically significant higher confidence levels are reported on the 2+2+2 mode of delivery of the six day training course in comparison to either the traditional 5 day or the mixed method modes of delivery. It recommends the use of confidence measures as a useful concept in the evaluation of training courses for union representatives as a way of improving value for money and return on investment for unions and a better developed trade union representative for the future.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barton, Andrew Ian"],"dc:date":"2011-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.525811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.495385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.494718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664920,"sim:weight":0.494035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.487137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.486971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.454906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.453615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.444416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.444416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.444416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.444416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.444416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.444416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.444416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.444416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.444416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.444416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.444416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.444416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This motif underpins the entire thesis. With survey responses from university educators and focus group encounters with clinical professionals undertaking the UK-wide Sexual Health Skills course, the study explores ways in which specific discourses pertaining to sexual health and illness inform the need for, and provision of, professional education for nurses in England.\r\nThrough using a Foucauldian ‘lens’ and a novel process called crystallisation in sexualities and gender epistemologies (S\u0026GE), it was possible to shed new light on some old problems hindering nurse education. The methodologies facilitated a discursive engagement between the power / knowledge of sexual health sciences (scientia sexualis), the orthodox ‘regimes of truth’, and various silenced voices. The silenced voices pertain to wider, socially and clinically ‘invisibilised’, needs of clients or patients in relation to the provision of nurse education.\r\nSet against the backdrop of England\u0027s first ever Government strategies on teenage pregnancy, sexual health and HIV, statistics on narrow definitions of sexual ill-health are still considered the worst in western Europe. Nurses acknowledge these poor facts, and witness to additional neglect related to sexual well-being in the wider, holistic, domains of a person\u0027s life, health and relationships. Respondents recount a lack of formal sexual health education in pre- and post qualifying curricula, including incidents of critical, experiential, ‘on the job’, learning which are capped and thwarted by clinical and educational staff who are unable and / or unwilling to explore the full learning potential through reflection and analysis of practice. Respondents acknowledge how their professional education frequently ill-equips them to deal with requirements in practice as well as newer, public health, demands on their roles to increase preventative education and effective health promotion. This thesis gives them a voice in expressing such concerns.\r\nThe outcome of this work has led to the conceptualisation of a model of ‘learning for life’ across a curricular triptych for professional education which supports client care. Panels of this triptych relate to the foundational or holistic dimensions of sexual health matters; ancillary aspects secondary to other health conditions, and finally, the specifics, those formally defined in epidemiology and strategies of sexual ill-health and associated stigmas.\r\nWhether someone qualified twenty-five years ago or within the last three months, the quality and quantity of formal sexual health learning across the curricular triptych model remains negligible and incommensurate with clinical demands on professional nursing care.","bibo:AuthorList":["Evans, David Thomas"],"dc:date":"2011-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.779447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158571,"sim:weight":0.650476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90719,"sim:weight":0.617795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":115036,"sim:weight":0.604884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1395199,"sim:weight":0.575599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145987,"sim:weight":0.572228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4152204,"sim:weight":0.566287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.564519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664380,"sim:weight":0.562877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780613,"sim:weight":0.5589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91681,"sim:weight":0.555523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.548582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385778,"sim:weight":0.546612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155698,"sim:weight":0.543343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9340286,"sim:weight":0.539034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":922090,"sim:weight":0.536335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83228,"sim:weight":0.53072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778842,"sim:weight":0.523519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":111817,"sim:weight":0.511694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1028171,"sim:weight":0.509951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":2795345,"ep:Repository":51,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Nursing staff experiences and responses to violence and aggression in the emergency department: a grounded theory study","bibo:abstract":"Aims\r\nThe aims of the study were to explore how emergency department (ED) nursing staff conceptualise the terms that encompass violence and aggression in the clinical area; to explore the formal reporting practices of nursing staff following such experiences and to explore situational factors at play, relating to the development of violent and aggressive incidents in the ED setting.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nViolence and aggression experienced by ED nursing staff is a well recognised, global phenomenon. Published research exploring ED violence and aggression however is limited, both numerically, and in terms of quality and sophistication. The literature review conducted for this study identified very few studies that considered defining violence and aggression in the ED setting. The literature suggests that ED nursing staff frequently fail to formally report experiences of violence and aggression and factors influencing reporting practices tend to be speculated upon rather than researched. A wide variety of situational factors are identified in the literature as contributing towards violence and aggression in the ED setting, although, only a limited number of original research papers have contributed new knowledge in this field. This study was subsequently conducted for the award of a Doctorate of Education and focuses upon educational factors, within the context of the research aims and emerging themes that can be perceived as relevant to the phenomenon of ED violence.\r\n\r\nMethodology and research design\r\nThe study was undertaken from August 2007 to May 2009 at a site specific, National Health Service (NHS), acute hospital ED in the south of England. Adopting an interpretive paradigm, data was collected and analysed within a grounded theory framework. Data triangulation was employed, with the researcher conducting a retrospective documentary inspection of ED violent incidents forms completed by nursing staff (n\u003d38), semi-structured interviews with ED nursing staff (n\u003d9) and periods of non- participant, unstructured observation (n\u003d17).\r\n\r\nFindings\r\nThe study identified multiple examples of conflict in the ED, including nursing staff personally experiencing, witnessing, or being aware of physical assaults on staff. This included both physical assaults involving weapons, along with high levels of verbal abuse. The study also identified the phenomenon of service user-on-service user conflict, an issue previously not considered in ED literature. \r\n\r\nThe findings highlighted that individual nursing participants considered a variety of complex factors when subjectively and inconsistently defining, assessing, managing, responding to and reporting workplace conflict. A wide variety of inter-related factors contributed to how participants defined violence and aggression, although the dominant theme that emerged related to inconsistent practice. A failure to clarify the concepts encompassing violence and aggression contributed towards a culture of under-reporting of incidents; although incident frequency and a perception by participants that formal reporting was a futile exercise that did not lead to change, were also highlighted.\r\n\r\nSome participants expressed a disempowered attitude towards working conditions, which limited a proactive approach to maximising personal safety in the department studied. A cocktail of potential situational factors was in addition identified, as contributing to conflict in the ED studied, in particular: poor corporate security, poor departmental design and infrastructure, negative service user attitude and behaviour. Stress, service user demographics, confrontational staff communication strategies and a limited proactive approach to managing violence and aggression in a professional manner at both personal and corporate levels were also cited. \r\n\r\nAlthough the study had 3 pre-determined research aims; from an educational perspective, 4 key themes emerged. These related to a limited evidence-based approach to managing ED violence, due to a paucity of research; particularly research conducted by clinical nursing staff. Inconsistent practice in assessment, management and reporting of ED violence, challenging working conditions compromising personal safety and stifling potential research opportunities, and a disempowered attitude displayed by some participants in relation to managing their occupational circumstances proactively. The data collected, during this study, in addition, highlighted multiple examples of participants being aware of, or potentially being involved in, practices that contravene the Nursing and Midwifery Council (2008) Code of conduct, performance and ethics for nurses and midwives.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe data collected during this study can be interpreted as suggesting that ED violence and aggression is poorly documented; the subject matter remains unclarified in clinical practice; specific incidents of violence and aggression are inconsistently assessed and managed and that there is a cocktail of factors which contributes towards the development of conflict in the ED.\r\n\r\nTwo central, core categories were identified during this work; and labelled as professional nursing identity, and professional maturity. The findings of this site specific study challenge the foundations of the nursing profession in terms of claims of professional status, as the data collected is incongruent with the characterisation of the attributes and traits of professional status.\r\n\r\nNursing identity relates to participants expressing widely differing views relating to the actual role of the ED nurse. This subsequently manifests as variations in the documentation, assessment, management and attitude of staff towards service users involved in conflict with staff.\r\n\r\nProfessional maturity relates to the limited research literature available examining this field, particularly research conducted by clinical nursing staff. This can be interpreted as reflecting a wider professional failing to embed a genuine research culture into the nursing profession. Professional maturity also relates to participants complying with the NMC code (2008).\r\n\r\nOne can propose that as the nursing profession develops and matures, individual members may project enhanced professional values which could lead to improved workplace circumstances. Currently, ambiguity and inconsistent practice characterise the nursing response to ED violence. This may be potentially rectified through a variety of higher educational (HE) initiatives designed to proactively and positively influence the two central core categories identified above.\r\n\r\nEducational recommendations relate to encouraging a policy shift in the HE sector to promote the development of genuine professional autonomy. This could be achieved through placing emphasis on facilitating the development of under-graduate nursing students as potential future researchers; by formally requiring under-graduate degree nursing students to engage in original data collection research activities. HE institutions should also strive to empower under-graduate nursing students to challenge current occupational workplace conditions, through a transformational leadership approach emphasising the development of confident, assertive, and politically astute nurses of the future.\r\n\r\nClarification relating to defining violence and aggression in the healthcare context, a review of current formal reporting procedures, a review of corporate security at the site examined, a wider debate relating to the role of the ED nurse, and increased research and education focusing upon ED violence and aggression are all suggested as further recommendations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ferns, Terence James"],"dc:date":"2011-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8716,"sim:weight":0.718497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654259,"sim:weight":0.710088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75279,"sim:weight":0.510924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654319,"sim:weight":0.500184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5723689,"sim:weight":0.486376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102665,"sim:weight":0.437295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75338,"sim:weight":0.436108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77678,"sim:weight":0.422496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5724659,"sim:weight":0.418945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.41384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2769009,"sim:weight":0.4114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108305,"sim:weight":0.391868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5067019,"sim:weight":0.384299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.357032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000051,"sim:weight":0.342773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75788,"sim:weight":0.337771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.331262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108769,"sim:weight":0.327762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.327583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5067342,"sim:weight":0.326551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Models typically use one of three basic approaches to represent space namely a continuous representation of space, a fine network of nodes or a coarse network of nodes. Each approach has its benefits and limitations; the continuous approach allows for an accurate representation of the building space and the movement and interaction of individual agents but suffers from relative poor computational performance; the coarse nodal approach allows for very rapid computation but suffers from an inability to accurately represent the physical interaction of individual agents with each other and with the structure. The fine nodal approach represents a compromise between the two extremes providing an ability to represent the interaction of agents while providing good computational performance.\r\n\r\nThis dissertation is an attempt to develop a technology which encompasses the benefits of the three spatial representation methods and maximises computational efficiency while providing an optimal environment to represent the movement and interaction of agents. This was achieved through a number of phases. The initial part of the research focused on the investigation of the spatial representation technique employed in current evacuation models and their respective capabilities. This was followed by a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge regarding circulation and egress data. The outcome of the analytical phases provided a foundation for eliciting the failings in current evacuation models and identifying approaches which would be conducive towards the sophistication of the current state of evacuation modelling. These concepts led to the generation of a blueprint comprising of algorithmic procedures, which were used as input in the implementation phase.\r\n\r\nThe buildingEXODUS evacuation model was used as a computational shell for the deployment of the new procedures. This shell features a sophisticated plug-in architecture which provided the appropriate platform for the incremental implementation, validation and integration of the newly developed models. The Continuous Model developed during the implementation phase comprises of advanced algorithms which provide a more detailed and thorough representation of human behaviour and movement. Moreover, this research has resulted in the development of a novel approach, called Hybrid Spatial Discretisation (HSD), which provides the flexibility of using a combination of fine node networks, coarse node networks and continuous regions for spatial representations in evacuation models. Furthermore, the validation phase has demonstrated the suitability and scalability of the HSD approach towards modelling the evacuation of large geometries while maximising computational efficiency.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chooramun, Nitish"],"dc:date":"2011-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383609,"sim:weight":0.507939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795327,"sim:weight":0.461071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999177,"sim:weight":0.429428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932306,"sim:weight":0.414948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388782,"sim:weight":0.37395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931835,"sim:weight":0.3648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1019207,"sim:weight":0.356484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8794447,"sim:weight":0.285846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":766018,"sim:weight":0.222042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9256707,"sim:weight":0.194195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The strategy used in this study involved the utilisation of surfactant-rich micelles; where by the impact sugars have on the free energy of exposure of hydrocarbon groups present within the surfactant micelles was examined. The observation made for sugar-surfactant study was then applied to explain the stabilisation of the native structure and thus the physiologically active form of the protein by sugars. The sugars that have been studied include sucrose, trehalose, maltose, raffinose and mannitol. The surfactants studied were sodium decyl sulphate (SDeS), sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STS).\r\n\r\nTensiometry was used to examine the impact of sugars on the critical micelle concentrations (CMC), Gibbs free energy change of micellization ( Gmic), surface pressure, surface excess concentration and area occupied per surfactant molecule. The free energy penalty of hydrocarbon chain exposure was obtained from the Gibbs free energy change of demicellization( Gdemic) which is equal but opposite in sign to the  Gmic. Measurements were carried out to elucidate the influence of sugar on the aforementioned surfactant properties as a function of increasing sugar concentration. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was then used to study -sugar surfactant interactions to give enthalpy ( Hmic) and entropy ( Smic) of micellization in addition to CMC and  Gmic, thus obtaining a full thermodynamic characterisation, complementing the results obtained by tensiometry.\r\n\r\nTensiometric results revealed that at increasing concentration of sugar, the CMC of the surfactants was decreased and a more negative  Gmic was obtained. ITC results revealed a similar trend for the effect of sugar on CMC and  Gmic while the  Hmic and  Smic was increased in the presence of the sugars. The results from surfactant studies suggest an increase in the free energy penalty of hydrocarbon group exposure to the aqueous environment, due to an unfavourable interaction between the hydrophobic groups and the aqueous sugar solution. Consequently, the aggregation process is thermodynamically favoured and more spontaneous in sugar solutions. For instance in SDeS the  Gmic in water and in sugar solution showed that micellization was more favourable in sugar solution ( Gmic \u003d -19.14 kJ mol−1 at 1.0M Trehalose) than in water ( Gmic \u003d -18.44 kJ mol−1). In addition, significant increases in surface pressure of the surfactants in the presence of sugars suggest an enhancement of the surface activity of the surfactants.\r\nIncreases in area occupied per surfactant molecules in the presence of sugars suggest increase in the size of the head group area thus, possible interactions between surfactant head group – sugar or sugar-water mediated interactions. Also increases  Hmic in comparison to lower values of  Smic obtained by calorimetry suggest possible hydrogen bonding. In conclusion, surfactant studies suggest that sugars would stabilize biological structures by a combination of both an exclusion from the hydrophobic group due to unfavourable interactions between the hydrophobic groups and possible polar interactions between polar groups.\r\n\r\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to study and characterise the effect of the sugars on the thermal stability of RNase A. The results revealed an increase the thermal stability of RNase A as shown by higher Tm values in the presence of sugars. Results obtained from surfactant studies were then related to DSC results, a linear relationship between the Tm and CMC values suggests a similar mechanism. Hence, though proteins are large complex molecules, their interaction with sugars or other small solutes could be related to simple model systems such as micelles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ehiwe, Tammy Iyobosa"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1141992,"sim:weight":0.471996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5857407,"sim:weight":0.436559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1568310,"sim:weight":0.375013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":649883,"sim:weight":0.335082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":758712,"sim:weight":0.323031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5673975,"sim:weight":0.317207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":775130,"sim:weight":0.315635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222813,"sim:weight":0.30642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47603,"sim:weight":0.281623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1115219,"sim:weight":0.269134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2681783,"sim:weight":0.266379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":645464,"sim:weight":0.2652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":835002,"sim:weight":0.253346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":683500,"sim:weight":0.252508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5850170,"sim:weight":0.249725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387341,"sim:weight":0.248427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1650745,"sim:weight":0.244398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2701664,"sim:weight":0.243264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.242598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653908,"sim:weight":0.240962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The method was successful in predicting the axial variables of the jet, and used to develop a turbulence modification model for such jets.\r\n\r\nThe method was finally used to model the deformation of a free surface impinged by a compressible jet, using a novel zonal method called zonal Gas And Liquid Analyser (GALA). Convergence was achieved with the method developed in this research, together with the application of the counter diffusion method to model the moving interface.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lebon, Gerard Serge Bruno"],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47315,"sim:weight":0.572733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43175,"sim:weight":0.535017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025274,"sim:weight":0.523267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45579,"sim:weight":0.501031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98830,"sim:weight":0.476043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890873,"sim:weight":0.464217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1018272,"sim:weight":0.457969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9039895,"sim:weight":0.455137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":766687,"sim:weight":0.453337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98555,"sim:weight":0.450728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316058,"sim:weight":0.443617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48331,"sim:weight":0.437479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99083,"sim:weight":0.426361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":729103,"sim:weight":0.426255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9019114,"sim:weight":0.410547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4892851,"sim:weight":0.406275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9031824,"sim:weight":0.397012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4873628,"sim:weight":0.39417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27116,"sim:weight":0.391472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":767671,"sim:weight":0.384118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These aim to provide general information and safety messages to occupants, and assist them in wayfinding during both circulation and evacuation. Despite the fact that signage systems are an important component in building wayfinding systems, there is a lack of relevant data concerning how occupants perceive, interpret and use the information conveyed by emergency signage. The effectiveness of signage systems is therefore difficult to assess and is not correctly represented in any existing evacuation models.\r\n\r\nIn this dissertation, this issue is addressed through two experiments and the modelling of the interaction with emergency signage based on the empirical findings. The first experiment involved measuring the maximum viewing distance of standard signs at various angles to produce an empirical representation of signage catchment area. The second experiment involved measuring the impact of a signage system on a population of 68 test subjects who were instructed to individually vacate a building by their own efforts. The evacuation path involved a number of decision points at which emergency signage was available to identify the appropriate path. Through analysis of data derived from questionnaires and video footage, the number of people who perceived and utilised the signage information to assist their egress is determined.\r\n\r\nThe experimental results are utilised to enhance the capability of the buildingEXODUS software. Firstly, the signage catchment area is revised to more accurately represent the visibility limits of signage than previously modelled according to the definition of signage visibility by regulations. Secondly, the impact of smoke on signage visibility is introduced and the representation of the impact of smoke on occupant evacuation performance is improved based on existing published data. \r\n\r\nFinally, the signage detection and compliance probabilities are assigned values based on the experimental data rather than the ideal values previously assumed. The impact that the enhanced signage model has on evacuation analysis is demonstrated in hypothetical evacuation scenarios. The new signage model is shown to produce a more representative and realistic estimate of expected egress times than previously.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that this dissertation will improve our understanding of a key phenomena – the interaction of people with signage, and allow interested parties (e.g. engineers, safety managers and designers, etc.) to more effectively and credibly examine the impact of signage systems upon pedestrian and evacuee movement.","bibo:AuthorList":["Xie, Hui"],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2795327,"sim:weight":0.373125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388782,"sim:weight":0.311175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999177,"sim:weight":0.305155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931835,"sim:weight":0.293348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":765642,"sim:weight":0.277998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The study investigated the role in four general FE colleges and adopted a case study approach, employing semi-structured interviews as the main research method. The findings suggest that the FTM role is extremely diverse and heterogeneous, elastic and poorly understood. Yet FTMs themselves enjoyed a high degree of autonomy in how they performed their roles. \r\n\r\nWithin colleges, FTMs worked within a trialectic of students, team and organisation and could be identified in one of four positions defined here in terms of metaphors of faith: for fundamentalists, students were the priority; priests put their teams first; converts prioritised the organisation; martyrs attempted to meet the demands of all three elements of the trialectic and suffered the highest degree of home invasion by work.\r\nWithin the resistant context of FE, FTMs found themselves the audience for a variety of forms of routine resistance by lecturers, from gossip and rumours to making out and withholding enthusiasm. However, as they were rarely the target of resistance, a number of FTMs colluded with their teams or turned a blind eye in the hope of continued cooperation; few were willing to challenge resistance. FTMs were also highly active in their own resistance, expressing principled dissent overtly to senior managers as well as manipulating data and even fiddling paperwork. Yet while change management within colleges appeared generally poor, resistance was not to change but to managerialism, surveillance and the culture of performativity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Page, Damien"],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2731780,"sim:weight":0.652431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.643302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75531,"sim:weight":0.636153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77288,"sim:weight":0.597872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43601,"sim:weight":0.591719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49310,"sim:weight":0.580427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4132,"sim:weight":0.579961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":79282,"sim:weight":0.576441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154750,"sim:weight":0.565396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667905,"sim:weight":0.564133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41346,"sim:weight":0.558537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49311,"sim:weight":0.555715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109564,"sim:weight":0.553602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145900,"sim:weight":0.543587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187733,"sim:weight":0.539631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83384,"sim:weight":0.508355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82829,"sim:weight":0.506478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151579,"sim:weight":0.48965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227269,"sim:weight":0.487074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13950,"sim:weight":0.479322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recognised as inevitable in product development, engineering changes may significantly influence lead time, development cost and product quality of new product development. It has been recognised that the earlier change issues are addressed, the greater product lifecycle costs can be saved.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, three main industrial requirements have been identified in engineering design change management, including: (i) a lack of formal methods to analyse the impacts of design changes on both functional requirements and physical components; (ii) a lack of methods to trace design change propagations; (iii) a lack of methods for conflict resolving in design change management. It is also identified that there is a lack of systematic method for reusing design knowledge to solve design conflicts. The literature review carried out in this project also confirms that there were no unified and systematic methods proposed to meet these industrial requirements.\r\n\r\nThis thesis reports a methodology and tool to meet these requirements and help designers trace, analyse and evaluate engineering changes occurring in the product design phase. A modelling method is employed to enhance the traceability of potential design changes occurred between the functional requirements domain and physical structure domain of design. Based on functional and physical models, a matrix-based method is developed to analyse change propagations between components and help find out design conflicts arising from design changes. A knowledge based method has been proposed to resolve design conflicts by reusing previous design change knowledge. A web-based distributed system has been developed to implement the proposed methodology. An engineering design change example from the collaborating company has been used in a case study to help understand the methodology and prove its usefulness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fei, Genyuan"],"dc:date":"2011-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.540581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.526444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.526444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.526444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.526444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.526444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.526444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.526444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.526444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.526444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.526444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.526444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.526444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.526444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.526444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.503475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.476457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.476451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.453465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.441177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The text is itself a series of narratives and counter-narratives that engage in a self-critical, deconstructive analysis of the underlying assumptions hitherto presented in many, if not most of the previous scholarship regarding the origins and identity of the Gypsies, with particular focus on the contextual and radically contingent nature of all such texts.  As such, the primary examination is an historiographical and theoretical consideration of the questions surrounding Gypsy ethnicity and identity.\r\n\r\nThe dissertation also considers to what extent the production of historical knowledge is affected by those who produce it from within and without the Gypsy community or communities themselves.  Most especially, this survey examines the production of literatures in Turkish scholarship, as related to the underlying conception of the book arguing for a re-examination of Romanī historiography from east to west, rather than the ‘traditional’ Orientalist and Europe-centric perspectives deployed by much of the previous scholarship.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the dissertation focuses upon the Turkish lands to argue that the historical experiences of Gypsies in this region are of critical importance in understanding the development of both European Romanī histories and in acknowledging the flawed basis for the universalist conceptions of European Roma identity and political mobilisation, as they are now articulated.  The importance of Islam in the origins and history of the Gypsies is stressed.\r\n\r\nThis theoretical framework underlies the interweaving narratives that make up the latter sections of the text, a reconsideration of the sources for early Gypsy history that posits an alternative narrative.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marsh, Adrian Richard Nathaneal"],"dc:date":"2008-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108446,"sim:weight":0.458209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227101,"sim:weight":0.251728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108067,"sim:weight":0.239121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109149,"sim:weight":0.219728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84910,"sim:weight":0.219719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.218466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.214331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85630,"sim:weight":0.196068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The second type of image will use photographs taken over recent months of the inside and outside of Dilston Grove and its locale. These latter images will create a site specific installation that will attempt to deconstruct the physical and political dimensions of the space and will be sited in  the main body of the building.\r\n\r\n\u0027The Great Art of Light and Darkness\u0027 is the title of a work on optics and the phases of the moon by Athanasius Kircher. Kircher was a leading scholar in his time of natural sciences and mathematics. In 1646 he published the first edition of this book and in it he described a projecting device, equipped with a focusing lens and a mirror, either flat or parabolic. Kircher described the construction of this ‘magic lantern’ by writing:\r\n\"Make ... a wooden box and put on it a chimney, so that the smoke of the lamp in the box is on a level with the opening, and insert in the opening a pipe or tube. The tube must contain a very good lens, but at the end of the tube...fasten the small glass plate, on which is painted an image in transparent water colours. Then the light of the lamp, penetrating through the lens and through the image on the glass (which is to be inserted... upside down) will throw an upright, enlarged coloured image on the white wall opposite.”\r\nWhen Mark Ingham started to use SLR film cameras as projection devices he wrote: ‘In a blackened out room light from a torch shines through a slide and on through the back of a backless old camera. A transparent, fleeting image captured by this same camera many years ago projects outwards from it. A white wall intervenes, to reveal a glowing circle of dappled coloured light. The lens of the\r\ncamera/projector focuses the image.’ \r\nHe sees his camera projectors as the direct descendant of those early ‘magic lanterns’, but instead of a wooden box and a lens he uses an SLR film camera. Replacing the smoky lamp he has cool running Light Emitting Diode spotlights and the ‘transparent water colours’ are replaced by photographic transparencies. The transparency is still inserted upside down in the device and enlarged colour images will be projected on to the walls of the Dilston Grove exhibition space in May-June 2008.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ingham, Mark"],"dc:date":"2008-05-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We thereby aim to shed light on the extent to which network dynamics and in particular, norm-driven selection of advisors may result from the internal functioning rules of the Court rather than from outside influences.\r\nOur results confirm that network dynamics tends to closely follow the formal structure of the Court, while normative attitudes hardly drive the evolution of this network. However, norms and organizational rules have a differential impact depending on members’ individual backgrounds and Chamber membership experiences.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tubaro, Paola","Lazega, Emmanuel","Mounier, Lise","Snijders, Tom A."],"dc:date":"2010-07-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.252036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.1778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205946,"sim:weight":0.134332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The research found that companies in Europe were keen to become more involved in public sector provision.  In South East Asia companies were concerned that middle class groups could use health insurance to access private sector health services.  All companies were remarkably supportive of regulation, except in relation to ownership.  There was also evidence that  new systems of public sector pricing would benefit the private sector.\r\n\r\nThis paper provides a follow- up to the strategies outlined by these companies five years ago.  It explores to what extent the company strategic goals have been met and how strategies have evolved over the period.  In one case, the company no longer operates health services.  Several companies have changed ownership and all companies have been involved in both acquisitions and divestments.  The paper will assess to what extent their relationships with the public health care sector have changed and what new strategies have been adopted.   This will provide an important contribution to health policy debates.  Wider understanding of multinational company behaviour is necessary to inform future health policy.\r\n\r\nThe contribution that this paper will make to research methodologies is a further contribution to research, which aims to assess how multinational health care companies change over time and how their relationships with the public sector evolve.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lethbridge, Jane"],"dc:date":"2010-07-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67058,"sim:weight":0.516623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67059,"sim:weight":0.372238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67126,"sim:weight":0.33793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.335725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109025,"sim:weight":0.321976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000059,"sim:weight":0.31137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.295072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.201639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Predose and postdose urinary metabolite profiles were determined by 1HNMRspectroscopy. The predose spectra were statistically analyzed in relation to drug etabolite excretion to detect predose biomarkers of drug fate and a human-gut microbiome cometabolite predictor was identified. Thus, we found that individuals having high redose urinary levels of p-cresol sulfate had low postdose urinary ratios of acetaminophen sulfate to acetaminophen lucuronide. We conclude that, in individuals with high acterially mediated p-cresol generation, competitive O-sulfonation of p-cresol reduces the effective systemic apacity to sulfonate acetaminophen. Given that acetaminophen is such a widely used and seemingly well-understood drug, this finding provides a clear demonstration of the immense potential and power of the pharmacometabonomic approach. However, we expect many other sulfonation reactions to be similarly affected by competition with p-cresol and our finding also has important implications for certain diseases as well as for the variable responses induced by many different drugs and xenobiotics. We propose that assessing the effects of microbiome activity should be an integral part of harmaceutical development and of personalized health care. Furthermore, we envisage that gut bacterial populations ight be deliberately manipulated to improve drug efficacy and to reduce adverse drug reactions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clayton, T.

From this it was concluded that very little work of an experimental corroborative nature had been out to substantiate whether erosion test results from a laboratory tester could be used to predict the life of a pneumatic conveyor bend.\r\n\r\nTwo test facilities were constructed to carry out tests under accurately controlled conditions. The first of these was a laboratory \u0027rotating disc accelerator\u0027 erosion tester, and the second an industrially scaled pneumatic conveying test facility.\r\n\r\nBoth test facilities yielded results that followed previously reported trends but also illustrated some trends that have been unreported in earlier work. It was found that the \u0027rotating disc accelerator\u0027 simulated erosion with minimal interference from inter-particulate collisions. For the pneumatic conveyor test bend used it was found that puncture of the bend wall occurred in the region where secondary particle impacts occurred, rather than in the region of primary impacts as reported in earlier work. Explanations for both these observations are given.\r\n\r\nAn optically based construction for a cylindrical mirror was used to predict the location of the puncture point in the bend, and the intensification of particle impacts in the region of the pipe bend due to the geometry of the bend. When this was combined with an empirical erosion model derived from results obtained from the rotating disc accelerator, an accurate estimate of the life of the bend could be made.

This paper presents new developments and evaluation of an enhanced approach for the intelligent monitoring of business processes using Case-Based Reasoning in the CBR-WIMS platform. A short overview of the CBR-WIMS approach, based on the representation of business process cases as graphs, comprising process events and their temporal relationships is presented. The enhanced similarity measure based on the Maximum Common Sub-graph is presented and an evaluation of its effectiveness and efficiency is shown and discussed. The evaluation uses historical data from a real business process. The paper also discusses the use of a clustering technique in CBR-WIMS. This allows the semi-automatic tagging of cases and so provides enhanced explanation and context to users, increasing the confidence and usability of retrieved solutions and advice. A set of experiments are presented and discussed showing the added value that this enhancement brings to the intelligent monitoring and management of real business processes in an organisation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kapetanakis, Stelios","Petridis, Miltos","Ma, Jixin","Knight, Brian","Bacon, Liz","Agudo, Belen Diaz","Cordier, Amelie"],"dc:date":"2011-06-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.285196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.18318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103798,"sim:weight":0.181321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.134342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although air travel is currently unavoidable, positive changes can be made at destination, whether this includes reduction of energy use in hotels, improving the infrastructure of the surrounding areas, introducing a carbon tax or by addressing the behavioural intentions of tourists. This study investigates perceived environmental friendliness and connects it with transport activities based on tourists’ experience while on holidays. Results were drawn from a survey of UK tourists (n\u003d420) which was conducted in a specific area in the southeast of Cyprus, in accommodation resorts typically associated with mass tourism.\r\nSurvey results show that for transfers to accommodation resorts, 89% of respondents used the bus, 6% used taxis, and 4% rented a car. From those who travelled outside the accommodation resorts (77.60%), 71.40% used some form of motorized travel and 36.9% used some form of non-motorized travel. At the same time, the results show that the majority of respondents perceive themselves as being environmentally friendly whilst on holidays. The objective was to explore whether those who are using motorized transport may be interested in becoming more environmentally friendly. Initial findings indicated that the data were not normally distributed. A Mann-Whitney test indicated that those who use motor transport were significantly less willing to become more environmentally friendly on holidays (U \u003d 15,652.50, p \u003c .05).  It also appears that those who rent cars are also less likely to change to an environmentally friendly attitude (U \u003d 13,960.50, p \u003c .05). The data suggests that it is first useful to explore further the environmental behaviour of tourists - for example different age groups and people renting cars - and the alternatives these individuals are willing to accept before attempting to alter the conditions that influence the sustainable management of the destination.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ieromonachou, Petros","Babula, Michael W.","Warren, James P."],"dc:date":"2011-04-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":61142,"sim:weight":0.306396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58899,"sim:weight":0.27176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108754,"sim:weight":0.215464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.21109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, firms that operate internationally benefit from risk reduction via diversification channel and also encounter higher risk exposure due to various risk factors in international markets. Using a sample of 566 multinational publicly listed companies in the London Stock Exchange during 1999 and 2010, this paper empirically tests whether firms’ degree of internationalisation is a new asset pricing factor in addition to the standard risk factors such as beta, size, book-to-market, leverage, momentum, and product market competition. The results show that firms’ degree of internationalisation is positively and significantly related to the cross-section of stock returns in all Fama and MacBeth regressions, even after accounting for beta, size, book-to-market, leverage, and momentum. In addition, the effect of internationalisation on stock return becomes statistically insignificant after controlling for product market competition, indicating that the interaction term between competition and internationalisation plays a role in explaining stock returns. Overall, the empirical findings indicate that firms or industries with higher degree of internationalisation earn, on average, higher risk-adjusted returns. The results of this paper suggest that although multinational firms can benefit from cash flow diversification by going international, firms with higher degree of internationalisation are risky than firms with lower degree of internationalisation due to higher political, foreign exchange, and distress risks faced by multinational companies in international markets.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hashem, Nawar"],"dc:date":"2012-02-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Building on Epstein\u0027s (2002) agent-based model, several alternative scenarios are generated. The systemic optimum, represented by complete absence of censorship, not only corresponds to lower levels of violence over time, but allows for significant periods of social peace after each outburst.","bibo:AuthorList":["Casilli, Antonio A.","Tubaro, Paola"],"dc:date":"2012-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.194147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85792,"sim:weight":0.192382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.188583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58787,"sim:weight":0.180096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108651,"sim:weight":0.17321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780590,"sim:weight":0.159426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108752,"sim:weight":0.15028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108852,"sim:weight":0.142901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85458,"sim:weight":0.138465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84976,"sim:weight":0.130754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930621,"sim:weight":0.126014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108419,"sim:weight":0.12451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108703,"sim:weight":0.0827998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Volatiles collected from flowers of African marigold, Tagetes erecta, and sweet pea, Lathyrus odouratus, were found to elicit electroantennographic (EAG) responses from the antennae of female H. armigera. Compounds active in GC-EAG analyses of T. erecta floral headspace samples, identified by GC-MS and comparison of retention times on polar and non-polar GC columns with authentic standards, were (E)-myroxide, benzaldehyde, (f)-linalool, phenylacetaldehyde and (-)- piperitone. EAG-active compounds in L. odouratus floral headspace samples were identified as diacetone, (-)-linalool, phenylacetaldehdyde and benzyl alcohol. Increases in upwind flight to air entrained extracts of floral odours indicated that these cues caused attraction when presented to female H. armigera. A synthetic T. erecta blend comprising benzaldehyde, (f)- linalool, phenylacetaldehyde and (+)-limonene gave significant increases in upwind flight approaches. Limonene (either (+)- or (-)-) was found to be important for the behavioural response despite having low EAG-activity. There was no significant difference in upwind flight response to odours from the live flower and the synthetic floral blend. Significant increases in upwind flight were also obtained when insects were presented with a synthetic L. odouratus blend which contained the four EAG-active compounds identified from GCEAG studies. In field trapping experiments in Israel there was a significant difference in H. armigera catches in traps with a standard 4-component T. erecta lure compared with unbaited traps over the whole season. Mean H. armigera catch per trap per night (both sexes) over the whole season in unbaited traps, floral odour traps, pheromone traps and light traps were 0.004,0.11,8.8 and 1.35 respectively. The floral baited traps were non-selective catching large numbers of Ilymenoptera and Diptera as well as other moth species. Field trapping experiments in Pakistan indicated that the floral lure was significantly attractive to Earias spp. and other Lepidoptera although very few H. armigera were caught due to low population density. Olfactory cues are discussed in relation to host-plant finding behaviour of H. armigera. They are involved in early stages of host seeking behaviour prior to alighting on the plant and stimulate searching behaviour.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bruce, Toby Johann"],"dc:date":"2000-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316045,"sim:weight":0.20867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27010,"sim:weight":0.145905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85646,"sim:weight":0.133031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.115436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.115436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108684,"sim:weight":0.113027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316044,"sim:weight":0.112311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26918,"sim:weight":0.107878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108157,"sim:weight":0.104589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108770,"sim:weight":0.102605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Aspects of the behaviour of fluidised powder in stationary beds were studied where it seemed possible that observations of such behaviour might be useful in predicting how the same powder would flow in an air-gravity conveyor. As a result, a simple chart was prepared allowing an estimate to be made of the minimum fIuidising velocity and the velocity at which entrainment of fines could occur from a knowledge only of the density and particle size of the powder concerned.\r\n\r\nThe design and performance of air-gravity conveyors was examined in some detail, considerable effort having been made to bring together as much as possible of the published information on this method of bulk solids transport. Practical problems on the design and operation of conveying installations have been highlighted and techniques are suggested to simplify the preliminary stages of design.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties facing the designer of air-gravity conveyors has been the lack of a convenient mathematical model that would enable the performance of a given conveyor to be reliably predicted. A number of possible modelling techniques were therefore investigated and a new modelling approach, based on the uniform flow of a fluid in an inclined channel has been proposed.\r\n\r\nThe experimental work was divided into two parts. In the first part various types of porous distributor material were examined and their relative merits discussed, and then a number of powders, having widely differing characteristics, were tested in a small fluidising rig. Significant features of the fluidisation behaviour of the powders in \"stationary\" (as opposed to \"flowing\") beds were recorded, notably their minimum fluidising veIocities and bulk densities.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the experiment programme involved the flow of an aerated p.v.c. powder, of about 120 um mean particle size, in an inclined channel. Two types of porous distributor were used in the channel, and in each case the relationships amongst the solids mass flowrate, the channel slope, the superficial velocity of the fluidising air and the depth of the flowing bed were observed. Using the modelling approach proposed previously, the results of the tests on the channel rig were analysed and it was concluded that, although more experimental data was needed, the correlation between the model and the data obtained so far confirmed that further investigation would be justified.","bibo:AuthorList":["Woodcock, C.

Additionally, to investigate individual and event characteristics. \r\n\r\nDesign: \r\nIn a European multi-centre study, 102 survivors of different disasters terror attack, flood, fire and collapse of a building were interviewed about their responses during the event. Survivors’ perceived posttraumatic stress levels were assessed with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Peritraumatic emotional stress and risk perception were rated retrospectively. Influences of individual characteristics, such as socio-demographic data, and event characteristics, such as time and exposure factors, on post- and peritraumatic outcomes were analyzed. \r\n\r\nResults: \r\nLevels of reported post- and peritraumatic outcomes differed significantly between types of disasters.

We sought to explore how the bumblebee Bombus terrestris copes with tasks involving flower colour discrimination under patchy illumination. Light patches varied between unobscured daylight and leaf-shade, as a bee might encounter in and around woodland. Using a flight arena and coloured filters, as well as one or two different colours of artificial flower, we quantified how bees chose to forage when presented with foraging tasks under patchy illumination. Bees were better at discriminating a pair of similar colours under simulated unobscured daylight illumination than when foraging under leaf-shade illumination. Accordingly, we found that bees with prior experience of simulated daylight but not leaf-shade illumination initially preferred to forage in simulated daylight when all artificial flowers contained rewards as well as when only one colour was rewarding, whereas bees with prior experience of both illuminants did not exhibit this preference. Bees also switched between illuminants less than expected by chance. This means that bees prefer illumination conditions with which they are familiar, and in which rewarding flower colours are easily distinguishable from unrewarding ones. Under patchy illumination, colour discrimination performance was substantially poorer than in homogenous light. The bees\u0027 abilities at coping with patchy light may therefore impact on foraging behaviour in the wild, particularly in woodlands, where illumination can change over short spatial scales.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arnold, Sarah E.J.","Chittka, Lars"],"dc:date":"2012-07-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
