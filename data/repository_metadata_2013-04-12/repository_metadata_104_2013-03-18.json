In safety critical industries other than commercial shipping, such as civil aviation, nuclear and petrochemical, research is being undertaken to identify behavioural markers that can be used to assess competence in crisis management.  Although there is now a general acceptance of the core concepts for the non-technical or resource management skills required for competence in crisis management, there is also an acceptance that the behaviours associated with these skills are context specific.  This research programme improves the understanding of how a behavioural marker system can be used to assess the competence in crisis management of merchant marine engineering officers within the context of a merchant vessel engine control room.\r\n\r\nThis research reviews the current practice in using behavioural markers for the assessment of competence in crisis management within safety critical industries and the military.  The differences between the assessment frameworks and environments in which behavioural markers are currently being used for this assessment of competence are discussed.  The influences of these differences on the use of behavioural markers for the assessment of competence in crisis management within the context of a merchant vessel engine room control room are investigated.\r\n\r\nThrough the use of ethnographic study, the research presents a set of behavioural markers that can be used to assess competence in crisis management within the context of a simulated merchant vessel\u0027s engine room control room.  The research concludes that these behavioural markers can be used as a valid objective assessment framework for the assessment of ocompetence in crisis management of merchant navy engineering officers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gatfield, David"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1592753,"sim:weight":0.67901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.430279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.430059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.429783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.424203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.411573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.378282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.361142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.360507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.354079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.353922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.353358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108868,"sim:weight":0.338839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98827,"sim:weight":0.325419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767834,"sim:weight":0.321059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222867,"sim:weight":0.321048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.316778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.301616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.2933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.2933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is designed for both sea and inland waterways for maximum flexibility. A comparison of  structural weights showed the benefits of GRP over\r\naluminium.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the Information Literacy Test (ILT) developed by James Madison University (JMU). Eighty-nine, level four students from the Faculty of Business, Sport and Enterprise completed the ILT. Student impressions of the test were obtained upon completion. The mean test score was (x± SD) 56 ± 15%. Analysis suggested that standards 2 and 5 were areas of particular concern. Student feedback suggested question format and layout were popular, although subject specific questions were preferred. In addition the number of test questions should be reduced. Whilst the ILT was comprehensive, the format of the test and language used was possibly not conducive with UK HE institutions. Therefore the research team plan to formulate a Solent ILT based on the SCONUL seven pillars.","bibo:AuthorList":["Forrester, Celia","Burnet, Scott"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5465,"sim:weight":0.41874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.413306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.394422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.392801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.392182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.391361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.38937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.369074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.367644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.365581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.363174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160793,"sim:weight":0.362316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.360959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.359184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.355893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.35372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.353538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.352239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.348294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.346993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A gap was identified as lecturers take traditional delivery methods and attempt to make them fit the blended learning model of delivery. The project aims to provide a better teaching and learning experience for the non-traditional adult learner by appointing e-champions on two blended delivery courses, to enhance our provision of blended learning courses and units.

This design would attempt to transcend the current distinction between motor and sailing charters which currently take roughly equal shares of the charter market. This would in effect double its potential market. It was also to be designed in as environmentally friendly a manner as possible. As time goes by environmental accreditation is becoming more important to both charter\r\ncompanies and the charterers’ themselves.\r\n\r\nThe main distinction of this design from other charter catamarans is its use of a traction kite in way of a standard rig to harness the wind energy and propel the\r\nvessel. This system has multiple benefits over the standard rig which are discussed within this report. As part of this project a rough velocity prediction of this vessel\r\nunder canvas was generated. This gave some interesting results showing this design outperforming similar vessels with standard rigs in certain conditions. This was\r\nimpressive considering it has less than a quarter of the canvas area of similar sized catamarans.\r\n\r\nThis vessel will also utilise a modern serial hybrid electric propulsion system tailor made for use on cruising catamarans. This gives this vessel the ability to store the\r\nrenewable energy captured by the vessels large area of solar panels, and also the power regenerated by the electric motor. It also gives the vessel the ability to be\r\nrecharged from shore power meaning the on board generator will only be used sporadically. This large level of battery storage also allows this vessel to run all the modern appliances for long periods of time without the use of a combustion engine.\r\n\r\nDue to this vessels high quantity of modern technology it was always going to be an expensive build. As a result of this, effort was made to give it a very luxurious feel in\r\norder to justify the increased charter costs necessary due to the increase in initial expenditure. The financial viability of this design was also reviewed.","bibo:AuthorList":["McMahon, Conor"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2710696,"sim:weight":0.258629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3170,"sim:weight":0.24662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33709,"sim:weight":0.242217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931561,"sim:weight":0.239769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.239581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.228422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.22719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27905,"sim:weight":0.218178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.212697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.210741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28485,"sim:weight":0.208337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.206997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.206997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.206997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.206997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.206997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.206997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.206997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.206997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.206997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":1592437,"ep:Repository":104,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Curriculum change: the introduction of a thinking skills course into an upper secondary school","bibo:abstract":"The thesis commences by considering the changes in the concept of intelligence over the last thirty years and the rise of programmes such as those of Lipman, de Bono, Sternberg and Feuerstein that make claims of improving the intellectual skills of school students.  The Somerset Thinking Skills Course (STSC) is an example of such a programme based on Feuerstein\u0027s theory.  The author seeks to evaluate the course to establish if it is a practical and effective medium for students across the full ability range of an upper school.  The research takes as its core a traditional experimental quantitative paradigm, but with an additional action research methodology enabling qualitative questions to be answered by students self-reporting during and imediately after the course, and again approximately twelve moths later.  A review format and structured staff interviews provide additional inputs.  The qualitative methods are set within the evaluative report framework of Stufflebeam\u0027s (CIPP) model.  The pilot study and the changes in the full study as it was carried out within a modular framework with different groups thus enabling an action reflection spiral is described.  For a sample of 322 pupils aged 13+ allocated to four ability bands and to either a control or experimental group, three hypotheses are developed:\r\n(i) that exposure to the first module of the STSC will have the effect of increasing the scores of non-verbal IQ tests administered before and after the intervention;\r\n(ii) that there will be positive qualitative reports to suggest that the STSC is helpful in developing a heuristic approach to problem solving and learning as reported by pupils;\r\n(iii) and that the effects are sufficiently robust for the change to happen within the milieu of an upper secondary school given the common major constraints on time and resources, with staff of different academic backgrounds, lacking experience and detailed training in this general area\r\n\r\nThe hypotheses are sll substantiated by the research described.  The results show that the STSC is of diffential benefit to groups in lower ability bands, whereas pupils in the higher ability bands reported that they had already developed the metacognitive skills of clear mental label, analysing and synthesising, following instructions, comparing and considering alternative possibilities.

As in similar safety critical industries, these situations are unpredictable events that may require co-ordinated but flexible and creative responses from individuals and teams working in stressful conditions. Fundamental skill requirements for crisis management are situational awareness and decision making. This paper reviews the naturalistic decision making (NDM) model for insights into the nature of these skills and considers the optimal training regimes to cultivate them. The paper concludes with a review of the issues regarding the assessment of crisis management skills and current research into the determination of behavioural markers for measuring competence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barnett, Michael","Gatfield, David","Habberley, John"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Marine.

The paper charts the development of the shipping industry’s approach to the preparation of bridge and engine room teams for normal and abnormal operations, and critiques the current training regime in resource management. Two case studies are presented to highlight some of the CRM issues raised by recent maritime casualties, and the paper then proceeds to set out a research agenda for exploring some of these issues. The paper provides an overview of three research initiatives: the first is to gain a better theoretical understanding of the nature of shared situational awareness and mental models in \"real world\" maritime operations. A second initiative is to identify a set of behavioural markers for assessing the non-technical skills of crisis management. The third initiative is to explore the role of organisational factors in safe operation, in recognition of the limitations of operator training as a panacea to prevent the re-occurrence of accidents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barnett, Michael","Gatfield, David","Pekcan, Claire"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M L Barnett, D Gatfield and J Habberley.

We have conducted a pilot study to integrate knowledge from cognitive psychology and computer science to investigate how to improve estimation when using analogy-based tools. We interviewed and assessed the personality of two experienced project managers to gain an understanding of their background and the problem solving strategies they currently\r\nemploy. Following these interviews, the project managers were given a typical project effort estimation task. The project managers were asked to complete the task using our analogical reasoning tool and articulate their processes by means of a ‘think aloud’ protocol. We found significant differences in prediction approach that may be in part be explained by personality differences.

Results from using CBR vary from ‘extremely impressive’ to ‘weaker than benchmark’ techniques, yet it is often unclear why this should be. In this presentation we will describe how theories from cognitive psychology help us better understand expert problem solving behaviour in a specific domain (software project effort prediction). In addition, we consider the interaction of personality with preferred problem solving strategies and report on some of our empirical investigations into the cognitive processes of professionals using CBR tools to solve real problems encountered in project effort prediction. The results are leading to (i) improved understanding, and therefore utilization, of analogy-based project estimation tools (CBR) and (ii) recommendations for more effective CBR tools.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mair, Carolyn","Shepperd, Martin","Stephens, Mark"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98511,"sim:weight":0.411749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684659,"sim:weight":0.391836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1593027,"sim:weight":0.381248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102704,"sim:weight":0.328875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387029,"sim:weight":0.242446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48424,"sim:weight":0.235424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9543459,"sim:weight":0.227525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45900,"sim:weight":0.21238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103116,"sim:weight":0.195124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020160,"sim:weight":0.194718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12942,"sim:weight":0.18921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43146,"sim:weight":0.184216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.182841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.182841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.182841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.182841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.182841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.182841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.182841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.182841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Taking a cognitive psychological approach, we argue that the algorithmic basis for CBR tools is not representative of human problem solving and this mismatch could account for inconsistent results. We describe the fundamentals of problem solving, focusing on experts solving ill-defined problems. This is supplemented by a systematic literature review of empirical studies of expert problem solving of nontrivial problems. We identified twelve studies. These studies suggest that analogical reasoning plays an important role in problem solving, but that CBR tools do not model this in a biologically plausible way. For example, the ability to induce structure and therefore find deeper analogies is widely seen as the hallmark of an expert. However, CBR tools fail to provide support for this type of reasoning for\r\nprediction. We conclude this mismatch between experts’ cognitive processes and software tools contributes to the erratic performance of analogy-based prediction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mair, Carolyn","Martincova, Miriam","Shepperd, Martin"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":333642,"sim:weight":0.287526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":333776,"sim:weight":0.214448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":1593068,"ep:Repository":104,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Solent Community of Pedagogic Practice","bibo:abstract":"The Community of Practice/Community of Learning approach facilitates networks of people who have common interests and aims. It is through these communities, both informal and formal, that participants are able to interact, communicate, learn from one another, solve problems and create new knowledge.  While the concept is certainly not new, many of the recent developments have seen organisations seeking to harness and develop knowledge that ‘adds value’ through knowledge management, individual and organisational learning.\r\n\r\nThe central aim of this feasibility study was to identify the main issues that would influence the design and development of a Community of Pedagogic Practice (CoPP) at Southampton Solent University.  There were four main parts to the study, starting with a detailed review of the literature relating to Communities of Practice/Learning Networks and Virtual communities of practice.  Four leading practice Higher Education Institutions, with recently launched and/or established communities of learning were identified.  Interviews with key members of staff from these institutions were used to gain an in-depth understanding of their experiences in developing and maintaining communities of learning.  Internal stakeholder research at Southampton Solent University was also completed this included one to one interviews with key stakeholders responsible for research and scholarship, staff development, and learning and teaching.  An online survey was administered in order to establish current and likely future pedagogic learning preferences of all academic and support staff.  Finally, the technological assessment sought to evaluate the potential of the University intranet to provide an online space to support the development of a community of practice.\r\n\r\nThe study concluded that there is broad support at Southampton Solent University for the establishment of a Community of Learning to support pedagogic research and share effective pedagogic practice.  Similar initiatives at other Higher Education Institutions are proving beneficial and attracting considerable interest (for example the Inquiring Pedagogies (iPED) Research Network at Coventry University).  Experience shows that the development of a successful Community of Learning will require time and persistence.  A number of barriers and areas for particular attention have been identified from the literature and case study institutions.  Awareness of these issues by the leaders of the proposed Community of Learning as Southampton Solent University will reduce the time needed for the network to become established and increase the return on investment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Briscoe, Sara","Hill, Anne","Macdonald, Lesley","Mills, Rob","Wellington, Sean","West, Lorry"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"B Allan and D Lewis.

The vessel is not designed to live in, but will allow the owners to spend a weekend or even longer periods onboard, if desired. The vessel should achieve 45 knots to cross to an island in the morning and return at night.\r\n\r\nA sport cruiser is a type of pleasure craft that must compromise between a very good performance in terms of high speed and good handling, and largesse of comfort in the accommodation area or exterior.  \r\n\t\r\nThe preliminary proposal will cover all the main subjects of the design spiral -hull form, weight estimation, propulsion, accommodation, deck lay-out, etc- each of these with their respective requirements.","bibo:AuthorList":["Inclan Campo, Gonzalo"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.265171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.264176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58888,"sim:weight":0.255381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.252098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.250554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929877,"sim:weight":0.248629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.242125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.242125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.242125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108957,"sim:weight":0.240306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154412,"sim:weight":0.239219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145517,"sim:weight":0.23101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352163,"sim:weight":0.230212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108721,"sim:weight":0.228622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84370,"sim:weight":0.226589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.226385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.224801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101260,"sim:weight":0.224758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108601,"sim:weight":0.222085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.221005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Designers and manufacturers have responded to the demand by creating vessels that are capable of high speeds. Traditionally, these vessels have small interiors, few amenities, little luxury and a short range. Thus we have the impractical ‘Hot Rod’ of the sea or otherwise called the ‘American Muscle Boat’. The availability has limited previous owners to using their vessels as day boats rather than weekenders.\r\nThis dissertation proposes a more modern response to the demand. Using a combination of modern high performance diesels, exotic materials, modern construction methods and a cost-effective location, the author has conceptually designed a vessel specifically to fit this demand.\r\nThe following dissertation consists of the preliminary design of the ‘Ferrari of Powerboats’, a vessel that is designed for two purposes.\r\n♦ A weekender capable of 70+ knots, reaching further areas in less time. Equipped with typical weekend luxuries capable of sleeping 2+2, kitchenette, head / shower \u0026 saloon with room for six, air condition.\r\n♦ A weekend endurance racer capable of speeds in excess of 80+ knots.","bibo:AuthorList":["Waddell, Zak"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108587,"sim:weight":0.175168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764016,"sim:weight":0.173395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.168641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.167921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.161362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.161014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.160741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106463,"sim:weight":0.159108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769042,"sim:weight":0.158893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.156185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.156185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.156185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.156185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.156185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.156185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.156185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.156185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.156185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.156185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.156185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As with a microphone, it has its own unique frequency response, a response which just like that of the microphone varies with sound pressure level. This variation explains why music sounds fuller at louder volumes. At such levels the ear produces a flatter response across the spectrum. This report outlines the design and implementation of an Audio Unit plugin, capable of correcting the ear\u0027s variable response.\r\nThe device as constructed operates as a graphic equalizer, pre-programmed with settings to suit the listening conditions from quiet to loud. The design stages and implementation are fully documented and the device produced is subsequently tested and substantiated for its intended purpose. The later design stages for automating the device using the output voltage of a microphone remain unimplemented due to time constraints. Finally, recommendations are made for the further development of the project.","bibo:AuthorList":["Milchem, Rob"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8998626,"sim:weight":0.234755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99478,"sim:weight":0.233765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18917,"sim:weight":0.223184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708251,"sim:weight":0.223014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447757,"sim:weight":0.213851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931409,"sim:weight":0.212737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.211082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447791,"sim:weight":0.205022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108391,"sim:weight":0.204814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.199646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393809,"sim:weight":0.198078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102593,"sim:weight":0.196919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710683,"sim:weight":0.193674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.193552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108579,"sim:weight":0.193471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23309,"sim:weight":0.192001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.190499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101301,"sim:weight":0.189126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145970,"sim:weight":0.183229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225485,"sim:weight":0.180298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Technologies play a key role in\r\ndelivering and supporting KM services, and this paper will focus on knowledge discovery in relation to the\r\nprocess of knowledge creation in the industrial setting. As a subset of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD),\r\ndata mining has been defined as the \"nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful\r\ninformation from data\". Two strands of KM are identifying existing knowledge and creating new knowledge – data\r\nmining offers organisations the facilities to discover, organise, check and analyse their body of knowledge. Data\r\nMining (DM) tools use data to build a model of the real world and the result of this modelling is a description of\r\npatterns and relationships in data, which can be used in pursuit of the primary data mining goals, i.e. prediction\r\nand description. Describing patterns and relationships in a complex dataset can provide the knowledge that\r\nguides future business actions. There are a range of data mining techniques for dealing with large-scale\r\ndatabases and sophisticated algorithms are incorporated into commercial software. This paper brings together\r\nsome existing frameworks and schemes to present a set of criteria for DM tools with the aim of assisting\r\nindustrial users and researchers in the selection process.

The Task-Orientated Multi-Functional Team Approach (TOMFTA) project took two significant undertakings for Southampton Solent as key areas for investigation, one academic and one administrative in focus. The academic project was the development of an innovative and novel degree programme in knowledge management (KM).\r\nThe new KM Honours degree programme is timely both in recognition of the increasing importance to organisations of knowledge as a commodity, and in its adoption of a distinctive structure and pedagogy. The methodology for the KM curriculum design brings together student-centred and market-driven approaches: positioning the programme for the interests of students and requirements of employers, rather than just the capabilities of staff; while looking at ways that courses can be delivered with more flexibility, e.g. accelerated and block-mode; with level-differentiated activities, common cross-year content and material that is multi-purpose for use in short courses. In order to permit context at multiple levels in common, a graduate skills strand is taught separately as part of the University’s business-facing education agenda.\r\nThe KM portfolio offers a programme of practically-based courses integrating key themes in knowledge management, business, information distribution and development of the media. They develop problem-solving, communications, teamwork and other employability skills as well as the domain skills needed by emerging information management technologies. The new courses are built on activities which focus on different aspects of KM, drawing on existing content as a knowledge base. This paper presents the ongoing development of the KM programme through the key aspects in its conception and design.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rees, John","Lu, Jing"],"dc:date":"2009-02","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Handzic and A Z Zhou.

In this paper, a framework for such analysis is applied to a substantial corpus of historical project data (ISBSG R9 data), selected without explicit bias. The consequent analysis yields sets of dominant variables, which are then used to construct project effort estimation models. Performance of the predictors on the raw variables and the extracted sets of variables is then measured in terms of Mean Magnitude of Relative Error (MMRE), Median of Magnitude of Relative Error (MdMRE) and prediction at levels 0.05, 0.1, and 0.25. The results from the comparative evaluation suggest that more accurate prediction models can be constructed for the selected prediction techniques. The framework processed predictor variables are statistically significant, at the 95% confidence level for both parametric techniques and one non-parametric technique. The results are also compared with the latest published results obtained by other research based on the same data set. The comparison indicates that, the models constructed using framework processed data are generally more accurate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ross, Maggie","Liu, Q","Qin, WZ","Mintram, R"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1132970,"sim:weight":0.329188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5844893,"sim:weight":0.31929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":820281,"sim:weight":0.315197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2700659,"sim:weight":0.314828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383664,"sim:weight":0.308348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86159,"sim:weight":0.303254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":897452,"sim:weight":0.294192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2673129,"sim:weight":0.279874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26925,"sim:weight":0.273803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":748603,"sim:weight":0.273687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5589314,"sim:weight":0.269634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":820033,"sim:weight":0.269454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9033676,"sim:weight":0.268226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767627,"sim:weight":0.267866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1097125,"sim:weight":0.266215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":20428,"sim:weight":0.257766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":789463,"sim:weight":0.255041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2702549,"sim:weight":0.250471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2702527,"sim:weight":0.248831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2700368,"sim:weight":0.245685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Multihulls are the fastest boats on the earth and have fascinated people for years since the Polynesians first discover a way to carry sails without adding a weight underneath the hull. Racing trimarans first appear in the 70s ocean singlehanded races such as the OSTAR, the former Europe 1 Star, won in 1972 by Alain Colas and Manureva first built for Eric Tabarly and rather known as Pen Duick IV. In 1978, a big monohull, Vendredi 13 is beaten on the finish line by a yellow trimaran four times smaller and multihulls have dominated the ocean races ever since. Multihulls are also good around the buoys, even if it is often denied: in 1988, the America’s Cup is won by Dennis Conner and a small catamarn, Stars \u0026 Stripes. Since the beginning of the development of racing multihulls in the 70s, these boats have greatly evolved and improved in many ways. Their behaviour and the loads carried are better explained and predicted and the development of new materials, a field constantly evolving, has allowed to design faster, stronger, lighter and more reliable multihulls than ever. The best example is The Race, the round the world race who took place this year. There was a big unknown about the possibilty of such huge boats sailing around the world and especially in the Southern Ocean. But these boats have been fabulous and will give now a very precious feedback for further development. Meanwhile, racing classes have been set up and the most important one nowadays is the 60’ Open. Most of the projects in this class are french ones but more and more people abroad are interested in this class which offers so much fun. The racing program is split into two parts: ocean transatlantique races, singlehanded and two-men raced and Grand Prix which are regatta around the buoys fully crewed.\r\nThe Preliminary Design of an Open 50’ Trimaran\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nAlexis de Guillebon, B.Eng YPD\r\n7\r\nThe class is very mature now and boats are very reliable as it has been proved during the last Route du Rhum in 1998, during which there hasn’t been any material failure nor capsize (apart from Yvan Bourgnon just out of St Malo harbour). But the 60’ Open are getting more expensive as they are more and more hi-tech: the last ones to have been launched since last summer are built with carbon pre-pregs for the first time. The cost of 60’ Open is about 1.5 million pounds and there are very few people who can afford such boats. Moreover they need a full-time crew to maintain them and prepare (and repare) them between the races. They also need very skilled and professional sailors as they are very tricky to sail: they can capsize very easily and are very stressful especially singlehanded. That’s why there has been a great interest after the last Route du Rhum in 1998 in setting up a new multihull class, less expensive and demanding in terms of preparation, physical condition, less time consuming and giving as much fun as the Open 60’. It has been found that a 50’ multihull budget would be half of an Open 60’s. This is a great opportunity for those who can’t afford a 60’ or simply don’t want to be involved in full time sailing as do the pro sailors, with all the constraints it implies. Unfortunately, sponsors may not be interested in the launch of a new class nowadays, as no Open 50’ has been built yet. There have been many preliminary designs from multihulls designers like Van Peteghem – Lauriot Prevost, Sebastien Schmidt, Marc Lombard but none of them has yet ended up in reality. The aim of this dissertation is to do a preliminary design of an Open 50’ multihull as it would be asked by a potential skipper. It means that this dissertation gives basic data of a potential racing 50’ trimaran but a real project would need further studies in many fields: fluids to find the best shape, FEA for the structure, which would need a lot of time and money and are far beyond a student’s means.","bibo:AuthorList":["De Guillebon, Alexis"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.41046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.339887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.335269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.309718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.309718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.309718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.309718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.309718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.309718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.309718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.309718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.309718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.309718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.309718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.309718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.309718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.309718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9549856,"sim:weight":0.300913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890342,"sim:weight":0.300225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.299466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

After spending some time in Australia, it had become apparent that this\r\ncountry had some unique problems regarding the control of its territorial waters. As a reasonably wealthy country in the Asia-Pacific region, it is frequently a destination for would be illegal immigrants, trying to cross the relatively short stretch of water between Indonesia or Papua New Guinea and the north coast of Australia. Seizures of more than 100 people on a single vessel are not uncommon.\r\nAs with most, if not all, developed countries, drug trafficking is a common problem.\r\nDue to the island nature of Australia, all of the imported narcotics must enter either by air or sea. It is the responsibility of the customs vessel to intercept those delivered by private sea-going vessels. This is an often-favoured route for smugglers due to the large quantities\r\nthat can be moved at once. Large quantities of narcotics can be found on vessels using these methods.\r\nOne of the major concerns for the design of a vessel for this particular task and operational area is the size of the territory under consideration. Australia has 37,000km of\r\ncoastline, much of it uninhabited. The patrol zone for a customs craft must also extend to the edge of these  territorial waters, 200km offshore. The total area of the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone is some 9 million square kilometres of sea3. These basic statistics begin to outline the importance of range, endurance and seakeeping as driving factors for the vessels’ design.","bibo:AuthorList":["Quinn, Ralph"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.279808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84370,"sim:weight":0.240699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.23865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586620,"sim:weight":0.237717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1665713,"sim:weight":0.236919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.234649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.234649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.234241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84284,"sim:weight":0.232216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316357,"sim:weight":0.231422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.229896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45075,"sim:weight":0.221693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108177,"sim:weight":0.213692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108926,"sim:weight":0.212839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43724,"sim:weight":0.212746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513386,"sim:weight":0.210701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9285,"sim:weight":0.206887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5084102,"sim:weight":0.206206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.204489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108799,"sim:weight":0.200207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Special Boat Service (SBS) is one such unit that specialise in water born and coastal operations. Over the years the SBS has adapted, and now require a quicker and more covert means of reaching their insertion. The projects aim is to design a Long Range Insertion Craft (LRIC) to meet these requirements, safely and effectively. This will be done by conducting studies on existing craft used by the Special Forces and analysing the data to obtain the principal dimensions for the design. Transportation of the LRIC will also be examined and the physical dimension restrictions applied to the design. A comparison of the petrol engine, diesel engine and the CODAG system was conducted. From this study the CODAG system was selected for it’s high power–to-weight ratio. From extensive research into the CODAG system, there is no system of the required size currently available. Therefore further research and discussion to concerned companies for specialist production is advised. A comparison into the direct drive, surface piercing propeller drive and the waterjet system was performed. The waterjet was the preferred system, due to it’s shallow water capabilities and low audio signature emission. To analyse the design, mass estimation calculations were conducted and a stability curve produced. The Lightship mass obtained from the mass estimation was 6.5 tonnes and the maximum GZ of the LRIC is 0.69 metres at 65.7 degrees. The design is quick and covert, and meets all criteria, but one. It is exceptional for swift undetected insertion into marine and coastal environments. The design, however, has one flaw in that the LRIC is too large in height to fit within the cabin of an HC-130J cabin.","bibo:AuthorList":["Beecher, Stephen J."],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.304484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.292621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.286617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.286617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.286617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.286617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.286617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.286617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.286617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.286617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.286617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.286617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.286617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.286617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.286617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.286617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.282434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.282433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.280048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271236,"sim:weight":0.278864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the literature it has been pointed out that there is a shortage of studies focusing on the impact of culture on service quality. What research has been done generally\r\nindicates that expectations of service quality by an individual may vary according to whether that person is from a high or low power distance, and whether from a high context or low context, cultural background. With increasing competition in the hospitality sector service quality could be an important factor in gaining competitive advantage, and understanding cultural differences and can be helpful in dealing with customers from different\r\nbackgrounds.\r\nFollowing a positivistic methodology and quantitative methods, an adapted version of the SERVQUAL questionnaire was administered to Arab and British hotel guests in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Consequently 504 correctly completed copies were analysed using hypotheses testing and correlation analysis. To the five dimensions of SERVQUAL- tangibles, empathy, responsiveness, assurance and reliability-a sixth dimension of sustainability was also added. This was a novel idea.  The findings showed that Arabs had, overall, lower expectations and perceptions of service quality than the British guests. This showed that there is a relationship between expectations of service quality and culture but that the finding could not be explained in terms of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions as the literature review generally suggests. Follow up interviews with hotel guests showed that the lower expectations of Arabs in general and Egyptians in particular, could be the result of their beliefs that Westerners are always treated better than Arabs by the hotel staff. The findings also show that environmentally friendly practices by hotels can be added as a dimension to SERVQUAL in respect of the hospitality sector.","bibo:AuthorList":["El-Mansouri, Ahmed"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":823662,"sim:weight":0.594378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5759922,"sim:weight":0.520777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101453,"sim:weight":0.50322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":853202,"sim:weight":0.487191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102642,"sim:weight":0.484678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2704840,"sim:weight":0.456309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020143,"sim:weight":0.436238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387042,"sim:weight":0.425773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99215,"sim:weight":0.39963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382004,"sim:weight":0.365636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101216,"sim:weight":0.341188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101420,"sim:weight":0.320496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108989,"sim:weight":0.319463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664687,"sim:weight":0.317523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145942,"sim:weight":0.31469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101394,"sim:weight":0.279689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184248,"sim:weight":0.258194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.255799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58196,"sim:weight":0.254413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61142,"sim:weight":0.252653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The performance however has been achieved in part at the expense of the cruising orientated luxuries of the vessel. It is felt that this type of vessel is being marketed towards an individual who relishes the thought of close, fast racing but would also require the capability to take the family coastal cruising and undertaking longer passages. Because of this the seaworthiness and comfort of the vessel are important aspects. The aim of the project was to design a vessel of approximately 50 feet in length which would be a fast and competitive racer but also a relatively easy and safe to handle, family cruiser. To achieve this an investigation into the use of modern honeycomb panels within the interior and the use of a lightweight carbon mast was carried out. The aim was to increase the overall performance and stability of the vessel by reducing the weight and lowering the centre of gravity but at the same time not losing the luxurious feel of a high quality family cruiser. This was achieved by producing two vessels based on the same hull but with varying weights and position centre of gravity. A computer generated stability program (Hydromax) was then used to study the changes in stability of the vessel. It was found that the range of stability rose by 18 % for the lighter weight vessel and its ability to right itself after capsize has increased by 11%. The performance gains were judged using a Velocity Production Program or V.P.P. and showed a potential speed increase resulting in an 18 second advantage on the original vessel over 1 nautical mile. The potential of repositioning the weight at the keel and increasing the overall sail area was also investigated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gardner, Mark"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.261988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.246167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764016,"sim:weight":0.242442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769042,"sim:weight":0.237321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.236815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.236321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.232566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.227042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.224731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.223453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.223077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.223077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.223077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.223077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.223077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.223077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.223077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.223077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.223077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.223077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This material became rapidly more popular, as a building material, then the usual building materials such as steel, wood and aluminium. The reason behind this is that it is more durable then the traditional materials. New technologies have brought many benefits to the world. Along with these benefits come problems, one of which is the disposal of solid waste in a most environmental friendly way. At present, the disposal of old FRP boats is done either by: burning them, sinking the boats or they are put in landfill sites. These are easy and relatively cheap ways of disposing the “dead” FRP yachts, however it is not environmental friendly. The aim of this project is to find a method of recycling/ disposing “dead” FRP boats in a most environmental friendly way. This project was undertaken because it covers the interest of the author and the most important reason is that it has great future potential. Relevant information was extracted from the available literature. The information gathered both from this method and from contact with experts in the FRP recycling industry was then analysed in relation to the hypothesis. The analysis revealed the existence of reasonable environmental friendly methods, used by the car recycling industry, to recycle FRP scrap. These methods may well be adapted to dispose old FRP yachts. There are two main driving forces to recycle “dead” FRP yachts, which are regulations and economics. This report concludes that: the “Cradle to Grave” law, which has been imposed by the European Union for the automotive industry, should be enforced for the marine industry in the near future. Once this has been done, the FRP yacht manufacturing industry should adapt a similar recycling circle as the car manufacturing industry. Limitations due to the availability of data and literature has restricted this work, therefore it has been necessary to speculate to an extent, whilst being as subjective as possible. It is the recommendation of this work that further research is conducted in this field.","bibo:AuthorList":["Loeff, Joris"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1146081,"sim:weight":0.254078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.245242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.236825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.236825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.236825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.236825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.236825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.236825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.236825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.236825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.236825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.236825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.236825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.236825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.236825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.236825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":117132,"sim:weight":0.232561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271236,"sim:weight":0.226175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5078829,"sim:weight":0.225778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.224362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Propellers are extensively used worldwide, to power everything from small boats up to large cargo carriers and battleships, though in the last few decades, new propulsion methods have been developed, and compete in a market previously dominated by propeller propulsion. Waterjet propulsion has experienced a recent boom, and more and more craft are being powered by this system, for both leisure and commercial applications. As the need and popularity of maritime activities has grown however, so has the number of incidents requiring assistance from rescue services the world over. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution has made it its goal to provide the necessary emergency cover to seafarers and those in peril around our coasts, and has strived to design and create modern lifeboats to fulfill the changing role of a lifeboat service in the present day. In the early days, a major break though was seen to be the transition from sail and oar power to the combustion engine, and it has remained like this for a several decades, with some of the most recent vessels such as the Severn and Trent Class boats still being powered by conventional propeller propulsion. A break with a long tradition was hailed with the launch of two new boats, the E-class waterjet powered craft and a hover rescue vehicle in 2002, and future developments are for a new Fast Slipway Boat and the possible inclusion of waterjet powered craft with the current fleet of all weather boats. It is with this idea in mind that this project is undertaken, and focuses on installing a waterjet into an existing lifeboat hull, and using manufacturers literature and other maritime formulae to develop an idea of the vessels new condition and performance characteristics. Although the equations used provide an idea of how a conversion or installation such as this would effect the chosen vessel, it is unlikely that a transformation of this nature could be carried out using an existing hull, because of the exact requirements of waterjet selection using boat resistance and engine power/speed data, and the amount of work that would need to be carried out to modify the hull to accommodate the new system. For this reason, the future of waterjet propulsion in a specifically designed hull, and the benefits that can be provided by a waterjet propelled lifeboat will be addressed and examined to determine the possible future applications of a jet powered craft in an organisation such as the RNLI.","bibo:AuthorList":["Notley, Andrew William"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27655,"sim:weight":0.352023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.301278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.299459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769042,"sim:weight":0.287372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.279643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.279611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.279611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.279611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.279611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.279611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.279611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.279611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.279611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.279611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.279611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.279611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.279611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.279611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.279611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9285,"sim:weight":0.259141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Amongst these boats, there are many different drive types in use, (namely; conventional shaft drive, outdrives, jetdrives and surface piercing drives). Some companies fit certain drive types as standard but quite a few leave the decision down the buyer. This can often be a difficult decision as not much ‘non-technical’ information is available on these different drive types.\r\nAn example of this is the Sunseeker SuperHawk 48’, which is currently available with twin outdrives, twin Arneson surface drives, triple outdrives or triple Trimax surface drives. Obviously, the decision is not going to be an easy one to make when considering the different performance, handling and economy characteristics of each installation, as well as the widely varying costs.\r\nThis problem can also be found in the commercial sector. Does a harbour master fit conventional drives for slow, economic easy handling or jet/surface drives for fast patrol work? Or even a combination of both?\r\nEven on the racing circuit different systems can be seen to be used as each team believes that their opted system will be best suited for the boat and racing conditions.\r\nThis project investigates the different types of drive systems currently in use in the recreational powerboat market on craft between 10 and 20m in length.\r\nResearch was carried out into the history and development of the drive systems, gathering information from a wide variety of different sources.\r\nIt was found that jetdrives and surface drives are used widely in the commercial and racing industry but aren’t used very widely in the recreational craft market.\r\nThe main drives in use are sterndrives and conventional shaft drives.\r\nThe drives were analysed to consider its performance, cost, and running efficiency and fuel consumption.\r\nA lack of available information made the analysis of jetdrives and surface drives difficult.\r\nIt was found that while the sterndrives in use proved better than shaft drives in all areas its physical capabilities restricted it to use in boats below 40ft.\r\nIt s thought that the current use of the drive systems is unlikely to change in the near future unless sterndrive manufacturers can improve the systems power-handling capabilities or peoples perception of jetdrives and surface drives being expensive and inefficient change dramatically over the next few years.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stones, Graham"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.27812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664656,"sim:weight":0.24984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.243003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.23622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666302,"sim:weight":0.229549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.219615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46163,"sim:weight":0.212966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There is a trend for that which high performance racing teams and classes use, other racing teams, classes and cruising yachts soon adopt. The method used to assess whether or not carbon masts are better then aluminium masts included using mathematical estimations for rig loads and rig construction. From this, a velocity prediction program could be created to estimate speed change and costing estimates could then be calculated. \r\nThe results of the case study velocity prediction program were that using carbon fibre masts had three major effects on the model. Firstly, that the overall displacement was lower thus reducing the wetted surface area. The second effect was partly because of the first but as the mast was lighter there was a reduction in the vertical centre of gravity thus increasing the righting arm. The third effect was, that with a decrease in the surface area of the mast therefore improving in the aerodynamics of the yacht. Due to all these reasons the yachts with carbon fibre masts were notably quicker in all true wind directions except when the wind was at 180 degrees. Here there was less of a difference due to the higher surface area of the aluminium mast. \r\nThe results of the costing study were partially inconclusive. As it was not necessarily 100% accurate due to problems of what costs should be included in the estimates and if so how many mast should the cost be set off against. But the results demonstrate that the cost of a carbon fibre mast is between 1.8 and 4.25 times the cost of an aluminium mast.

Polar areas are extreme destinations\r\nwhich require both specific design and equipment. The author intended to create a yacht that fulfils the requirements of an expedition vessel while meeting customers’ common demands in terms of sailing, adventure and ecology.\r\nFirst a parametric study was carried out to determine a design guideline and fix the main characteristics.

The boat had to comply with general needs in terms of accommodation space, sailing capacity and also\r\nwith minimum stability criteria.\r\nThe general arrangement was an essential factor of the target design. Practical considerations leaded the interior design, which should be comfortable and sheltered.\r\nBecause of the yacht program, sail ability and stability were the key words when establishing the sail plan. Likewise low draft appendages were based on practical\r\nsolutions well used in the nautical industry.\r\nThe sailing balance was also demonstrated and a velocity prediction was carried out using WinVPP TM.\r\nFrom a construction point of view, the choice of the hull material was based on the author’s research.

That imposes many requirements for the boat to be accessible, comfortable and safe. To meet the requests, a catamaran of 40ft is designed with a novel stepped hull. The objective of this project is to establish the preliminary design on the first part and then use it a base for more studies on different elements. Once the preliminary design is achieved, the first research established is on the behaviour of the steps in waves via the towing tank and the wave maker. The measurements obtained are tricky to interpret and others tools are used to help on the conclusion. Finally, the measurements obtained are not reliable and cannot be used further. Nevertheless, the video taken onboard helps to improve the shape of the steps to reduce the drag. Then for the mast, a complete study is achieved on the rig forces. As the tension on the diamonds cannot be calculated statically, a Finite Element Analysis is carried out to determine the applied tension on each wire and then select the correct diameter. For credible results, the analysis is established step by step which validates the computer model with reality. Via the tank testing, different daggerboards can be tested and compared. The efficiency of an end plate can then be analysed and compared to a conventional one. The results show that the end plate diminishes the yaw angle but generates a bit more drag.

It is intended to replicate a common scenario found in the yacht design industry. The brief was to design an aluminium hulled yacht to accommodate a family of four plus guests and provide facilities for SCUBA diving with an integral garage for the tender. Aesthetics were important to the client, who expressed a desire for uncluttered decks and sleek lines. The yacht needed to be capable of being sailed short handed. In this case, the client is both the author and the designer and the design is loosely based around his interests. The type of yacht chosen was seen to be more challenging from a designer’s point of view as apposed to a racing yacht, for example, where there are fewer compromises and design decisions are clearer cut. The project began with research into tenders and dive boats as garaging, combined with accommodation for eight passengers would determine the general arrangement and size of the vessel. The process was carried out this way as client had not specified the length of the yacht, but its practical requirements. From this a study was carried out on vessels of the appropriate size and the initial parametrics were produced and the design spiral started. The finished design was for a seventy foot yacht, 15 foot wide. It included a stern garage for the tender, also housing the liferaft and compressor. To double cabins with en-suites and two single cabins with additional ‘Pullman’ berths and a shared head were arranged as close to amidships as possible. This reduced seaway accelerations, creating a layout that was both practical and comfortable for passengers. A large galley and saloon was placed on the port side. A two-rudder configuration was selected to counter balance the problems associated with the wide flat hull. Other specific design features included: - a self tacking jib and automated sailing controls. A safety survey of the craft was undertaken and full range of safety features were incorporated into the design. Challenges of this design included the general arrangement and the logistics of fitting a large tender into a comparatively small boat.

Following the success of the TP52 class, the smaller and more affordable GP42 is expected to help reinvigorate the Grand Prix racing seen which has been so inactive since the demise of the old IOR ton classes. The aim of this project was to design a GP42 targeted at the Mediterranean racing circuit. The design process started with the development of a base hull, appendage package, sailplan and detailed weight estimation. This provided the grounds on which to carry out a VPP study in order to evaluate a range of parametric hull variations. The extremely high sail area – displacement ratio of these yachts is likely to result in a performance not dissimilar to that of a TP52. It is unlikely that the standard VPP force model will accurately predict the resistance characteristics of these boats, which are expected to make the jump into the planing mode downwind. As a result it was decided that a full matrix of tank test runs (upright and heeled and yawed) should be carried out with a view to creating a design-specific VPP. This was achieved using the Wolfson Experimental Method (WUX), where tank test data was regressed to define the resistance characteristics of the yacht over a range of operating speeds and conditions. Unfortunately due to very steep induced drag factor slopes, possibly brought on by appendage flutter, there were difficulties obtaining reasonable heel and induced drag WUX coefficients. While it was felt that the coefficients were not wholly reliable, VPP predictions from the experimental force model were compared with predictions from the standard force model and with a second experimental model derived from the VPP’s own resistance predictions for the tank test runs. The experimental model derived from the tank data did not provide a reliable source on which to carry out further analysis, but enough insight was gained through observations made during the tank sessions and from the initial VPP study from which to develop a final design.","bibo:AuthorList":["Humphreys, Tom"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.329876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27810,"sim:weight":0.309949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31718,"sim:weight":0.299843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.298197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27230,"sim:weight":0.290467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.290448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.251937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27086,"sim:weight":0.247029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.242528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.216586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.215879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.215879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.215879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.215879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.215879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.215879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.215879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.215879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.215879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.215879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The project developed the design of a 15-metre, trawler-style flybridge motor yacht in addition to researching the potential use of propeller tunnels on the design hull.\r\nTrawler-style motor yachts are traditionally designed with long-distance cruising in mind and as such are typically round-bilge displacement or semi-displacement type hulls. There are however, a number of higher performance trawler-style motor yachts on the market aimed at weekend and shorter range cruising. These are produced by manufacturers such as Grand Banks, Hardy Marine, Seaward, Beneteau and Nimbus.\r\nThis project centered around designing a similar higher performance hull in conjunction with an investigation into the potential use of propeller tunnels or pockets on such a hull. Tunnels or pockets have been and are used on several types of motor vessel including Tyne-class lifeboats, recreational motor yachts, commercial launches and naval vessels. There are several reasons for their use including draft reduction, increased propeller diameter (potential efficiency benefits), and reducing shaft angle (increased potential engine location options and thrust improvements).\r\nThis report includes a tow tank investigation into the effect of propeller tunnels on hull drag alone, through comparison of two exact scale models. The models were constructed from GRP, one with tunnels and one without, from a GRP female mould taken from a similar style model hull. These models were then tow tank tested through a relevant speed range to compare resistance, heave and trim behaviour.\r\nThe results indicated that up until the maximum design speed required by the brief, the use of partial propeller tunnels provided a small beneficial drag effect. Further in-depth results analysis and propeller efficiency research is provided within this report. However, on the basis of these results, a decision was taken to incorporate tunnel pockets into the design hull.","bibo:AuthorList":["Law, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26693,"sim:weight":0.384182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27655,"sim:weight":0.368425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23731,"sim:weight":0.324901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.321798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9018386,"sim:weight":0.321373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28486,"sim:weight":0.288902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106463,"sim:weight":0.264397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.263209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23730,"sim:weight":0.221076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.211713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":307102,"sim:weight":0.208117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25998,"sim:weight":0.192488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9023409,"sim:weight":0.179712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27905,"sim:weight":0.178568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826931,"sim:weight":0.177476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28346,"sim:weight":0.171206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1491266,"sim:weight":0.16986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9036260,"sim:weight":0.168384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.155522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24296,"sim:weight":0.149872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The structure design has to follow the ABS regulation; and it has to be light and strong, consequently the material chosen to make the hull can be carbon prepreg and nomex core.","bibo:AuthorList":["Troussier, Tara"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.329851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.328596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271236,"sim:weight":0.305638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.301937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22948,"sim:weight":0.290088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664544,"sim:weight":0.28429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.266376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Is this due to cost, speed of manufacture or technique?","bibo:abstract":"This project has been undertaken because there has been a noticeable change in the style of the inflatable collars and the tube attachment methods that are used on Rigid Inflatable Boats (R.I.B’s). As changes have occurred to the trend it has been decided to investigate into possible reasons for why this has happened.\r\nThe author has been working part time in the RIB industry for over five years on a part time basis and has seen many different makes and models. He has been involved in the majority of parts that make up RIB manufacture and repair. He has primarily been involved in the leisure industry and worked for one of the largest rib sales and service companies in the UK.\r\nThe methods that are going to be used in this project are a time study and a cost analysis. Two similar sized boats will be used and compared in many ways with consideration to the technique used to make them, the speed of the build and the cost, using both material and labour cost.\r\nThis project also focuses mainly on the Hypalon tube side of the industry. This is due to the variety of construction types and styles that can be used with this material, which is where the trend was noticed.\r\nSeveral companies where visited, and the information from these visits were used to produce a time and cost study.\r\nThis study found that the sectional style tube had an 8-hour shorter build time than the sectional.\r\nIt also proved that the sectional style tube uses less material. It is therefore cheaper in material cost when based on a m2 study. The seamless style produces more wastage due to the intricate and banana shape of the tube.\r\nAs the seamless style has a shorter build time than the sectional style it was cheaper in labour cost.\r\nThese results proved that the change from sectional to seamless has been because of a shorter production time and a lower material and labour cost. There were also other factors for the change that unfortunately could not be proved, such as the argument for aesthetics.","bibo:AuthorList":["D\u0027Alcorn, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.311807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.310639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.310639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.310639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.310639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.310639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.310639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.310639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.310639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.310639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.310639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.310639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.310639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.310639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.310639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.297657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.295177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108085,"sim:weight":0.294193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383317,"sim:weight":0.282633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.281097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim then was to determine the reasons for this, and namely, to investigate why stitched fabrics are not being used more widely throughout the production boat building industry. Attention was drawn firstly to the design of composite structures using these reinforcements, followed by the manufacturing processes used to apply them. Consideration was given to any barriers to new technology, including any health and safety drawbacks and structural issues. Test panels were then constructed, one of each reinforcement type, Chopped Strand Mat and Woven Roving, Double Bias stitched fabric, and Quadriaxial stitched fabric. These panels were then cut into samples and tested for flexural properties and fibre content at the Southampton Solent University Test Labs. Using the obtained mechanical properties a case study was then carried out using Lloyds Register Special Service Craft software, investigating design with both in plane and flexural properties, which then lead onto discussion as to stiffness, thickness, mass and cost.\r\nFrom the investigation it was concluded that stitched fabrics are not used more widely in the production boat building industry because the budget does not allow for the amount of design work required to use the reinforcements to their full potential, or the cost of the reinforcement itself. Furthermore, CSM / WR produces a laminate almost as stiff as the stitched equivalent, builds up thickness more quickly due to the lower fibre content, and requires much less design work as it is so established. Classification societies require a certain thickness, however this is governed by robustness, and therefore the ability to build up thickness is desirable. Stitched fabrics increase mechanical properties, however the thickness required to pass criteria requires several more layers than CSM / WR, and the stresses in a hull structure are relatively low.","bibo:AuthorList":["Millington, Matthew"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43509,"sim:weight":0.300732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22948,"sim:weight":0.277555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24911,"sim:weight":0.271362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26461,"sim:weight":0.268836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387181,"sim:weight":0.267655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26462,"sim:weight":0.26752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271236,"sim:weight":0.267109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101190,"sim:weight":0.255016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387179,"sim:weight":0.248637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45218,"sim:weight":0.245334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18164,"sim:weight":0.243752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98610,"sim:weight":0.239825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98541,"sim:weight":0.234134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.22994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.22994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.22994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.22994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.22994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.22994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.22994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This would be built out of a sandwich lay-up for strength and weight aspects\r\nAs for performance and Stability, the general performance is as good as can be expected, with a few modifications to the shaft angle and weight the Talisman will perform very well against it’s competitors.

Based on the classifications identified, the second follow-up study will use face-to-face focus groups to collect further thoughts on these classifications, and the new data will be presented at this CHI Workshop. It is hoped that the feedback at the Workshop will help to direct further research using qualitative methods to analyse naturally-occurring identity descriptions found on social networking sites.

In this paper, we present association rule mining based methods to predict defect associations and defect correction effort. This is to help developers detect software defects and assist project managers in allocating testing resources more effectively. We applied the proposed methods to the SEL defect data consisting of more than 200 projects over more than 15 years. The results show that, for defect association prediction, the accuracy is very high and the false-negative rate is very low. Likewise, for the defect correction effort prediction, the accuracy for both defect isolation effort prediction and defect correction effort prediction are also high. We compared the defect correction effort prediction method with other types of methods—PART, C4.5, and Naıve Bayes and show that accuracy has been improved by at least 23 percent. We also evaluated the impact of support and confidence levels on prediction accuracy, false negative rate, false-positive rate, and the number of rules. We found that higher support and confidence levels may not result in higher prediction accuracy, and a sufficient number of rules is a precondition for high prediction accuracy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Song, Qinbao","Shepperd, Martin","Cartwright, Michelle","Mair, Carolyn"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Agrawal, T Imielinski and A Swami.

We believe this to be important since there is a growing body of published work that seeks to assess different prediction approaches. Unfortunately, results – to date – are rather inconsistent so we are interested in the extent to which this might be explained by different data sets.\r\nMETHOD - we performed an exhaustive search from 1980\r\nonwards from three software engineering journals for research papers that used project data sets to compare cost\r\nprediction systems.\r\nRESULTS - this identified a total of 50 papers that used, one or more times, a total of 74 unique project data sets. We observed that some of the better known and publicly accessible data sets were used repeatedly making them potentially disproportionately influential. Such data sets also tend to be amongst the oldest with potential problems of obsolescence. We also note that only about 70% of all data sets are in the public domain and this can be particularly problematic when the data set description is incomplete or limited. Finally, extracting relevant information from research papers has been time consuming due to different styles of presentation and levels of contextural information.\r\nCONCLUSIONS - we believe there are two lessons to learn.\r\nFirst, the community needs to consider the quality and appropriateness of the data set being utilised; not all data sets are equal. Second, we need to assess the way results are presented in order to facilitate meta-analysis and whether a standard protocol would be appropriate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mair, Carolyn","Shepperd, Martin","Jorgensen, Magne"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Benington.

More recently, attention has turned to a variety of machine learning methods such as artifcial neural networks (ANNs), case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule induction (RI). This paper outlines some comparative research into the use of these three machine learning methods to build software eort prediction\r\nsystems. We briefly describe each method and then apply the techniques to a dataset of 81 software projects derived from a Canadian software house in the late 1980s. We compare the prediction systems in terms of three factors: accuracy, explanatory value and configurability. We show that ANN methods have superior accuracy and that RI methods are least accurate. However, this view is somewhat counteracted by problems with explanatory value and configurability. For example, we found that considerable\r\neffort was required to configure the ANN and that this compared very unfavourably with the other techniques, particularly CBR and least squares regression (LSR). We suggest that further work be carried out, both to further explore interaction between the enduser and the prediction system, and also to facilitate configuration, particularly of ANNs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mair, Carolyn","Kadoda, Gada","Lefley, Martin","Phalp, Keith","Schofield, Chris","Shepperd, Martin","Webster, Steve"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Aarmodt and E Plaza.

Reflective practitioners are able to self-regulate and monitor their progress. Reflecting on what was learned can help students become more aware of their own thought processes (McCrindle and Christensen 1995), but reflecting on how it was learned, metacognition (Flavell 1978) offers far greater benefits. There exists mounting evidence for the benefits of metacognition in relation to enhanced performance and academic success (e.g. Coutinho 2007; Dunning et al. 2003). However, despite the costly time investment incurred by recording reflections in journals, reflections are more often retrieved from memory than from the written word. Thus the retrieved reflection is subject to the fallibility of human memory (e.g. Baddeley 1999, p.275): distortion, embellishment or forgetting. Furthermore, despite evidence demonstrating that when learners know reflections are to be read, graded or assessed by others, the incentive is to demonstrate knowledge and hide ignorance or doubt (Boud and Walker 1998), students’ reflections in HE are typically assessed.  Dewey’s original purpose of reflection was to consider and strive to overcome weaknesses. In fact, Boud (1999) highlights the dichotomies between the nature of reflection and the nature of assessment, and questions the value and integrity of assessing reflective practice at all.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mair, Carolyn"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A D Baddeley.

These projects are quite diverse type (new and maintenance projects), in terms of\r\nsize (6 to over 5000 function points), effort (55 to over 60000 person hours), application domain and implementation technology. There are three main findings. First productivity varies enormously between projects. Second, project type has limited influence on productivity. Third,\r\napplication domain or business area has a major impact upon productivity. Because this data set is not a random sample generalisation is somewhat problematic, we hope that it contributes to an overall body of knowledge about software productivity and thereby facilitates the construction of a bigger picture.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mair, Carolyn","Shepperd, Martin","Forselius, Pekka"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We need to systematically address missing data values, feature subset selection and the continuous evolution of predictions as the project unfolds, and all of this in the context of data-starvation and noisy data. However, in this paper, we particularly focus on feature subset selection and effort prediction at an early stage of a project. We propose a novel approach of using Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) of Grey System Theory (GST), which is a recently developed system engineering theory based on the uncertainty of small samples. In this work we address some of the theoretical challenges in applying GRA to feature subset selection and effort prediction, and then evaluate our approach on five publicly available industrial data sets using stepwise regression as a benchmark. The results are very encouraging in the sense of being comparable or better than other machine learning techniques and thus indicate that the method has considerable potential.","bibo:AuthorList":["Song, Qinbao","Shepperd, Martin","Mair, Carolyn"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Albrecht and J Gaffney.

This paper describes psychophysical work and an outline of the proposed model. A rapid serial visual processing paradigm with a post-cue response task was used in three experimental conditions: spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal. Using a ‘staircase’ procedure, stimulus onset asynchrony for each observer for each condition was set in practice trails to achieve ~50% error rates. Results indicate that spatial location information helps bind objects features and temporal location information hinders it. Our expectation is that the proposed neural model will demonstrate a binding mechanism by exhibiting regions of enhanced activity in the location of the target when presented with a partial post-cue. In future work, the model could be lesioned so that neuropsychological phenomena might be exhibited. In such a way, the mechanisms underlying object feature binding might be clarified.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mair, Carolyn","Shepperd, Martin","Kirsopp, C.","Premraj, R.","Bowman, H.","Labiouise, C."],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A D Baddeley.

More recently, attention has turned to a variety of machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule induction (RI). This position paper outlines some preliminary research into the use of rule induction methods to build software cost models. We briefly describe the use of rule induction methods and then apply the technique to a dataset of 81 software projects derived from a Canadian software house in the late 1980s. We show that RI methods tend to be unstable and generally predict with quite variable accuracy. Pruning the feature set, however, has a significant impact upon accuracy. We also compare our results with a prediction system based upon a standard regression procedure. We suggest that further work is carried out to examine the effects of the relationships among, and between, the features of the attributes on the generated rules in an attempt to improve on current prediction techniques and enhance our understanding of machine learning methods.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mair, Carolyn","Shepperd, Martin"],"dc:date":"1999-05","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"B W Boehm.

These radios became the main family entertainment in the home until television takes over that role in the mid 1950s. Then radio changed to a portable medium with the coming of transistor radios, to become the personal entertainment\r\nmedium it is today. \r\nChapter two and three considers the new terrestrial digital mediums of DAB and DRM2 plus how it works, what it is capable of plus a look at some of the otherdigital radio platforms. \r\nChapter four examines how sound is perceived by the listener and that radio broadcasters will need to understand the relationship between sound and vision. We receive sound and then make pictures in the mind but to make sense of sound we need codes to know what it is and make sense of it. \r\nChapter five will critically examine the issues of commercial success in radio and where pictures could help improve the radio experience as there are some things that radio is restricted to as a sound only medium. This will be\r\nconsidered to see whether radio can be improved with graphics and pictures. \r\nChapter six will provide a background to the equipment available for the reception of digital radio and the\r\nreceivers needed for picture radio. In addition the type of programmes that could be enhanced, as other media has, by the use of pictures and illustrations will be considered.\r\nAlso there will be a critical discussion on the use of picture radio worldwide and the place of picture radio in international radio broadcasting.","bibo:AuthorList":["Warburton, John Henry"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Books Barnard and S.

Racing fleets of 40.7\u0027s are very predominant in Spain, France, United Kingdom and Australia. These boats have been campaigned within large handicap events and appear to be very at home\r\nunder race conditions, in part due to there excellent rating under the IRC and IMS rules, and also due to their exciting sailing characteristics. They are also equally at home cruising long distances at speed and in relative comfort.\r\nThe true racing pedigree of this yacht is held back by the dual-purpose nature of the boat. The boat is a light displacement boat that is built using very basic specifications, and materials. The essence of this boat is two fold – cruising and racing, but a fact of life is that the racing pedigree of the hull form is held back by the sheer nature that the boat has to be able to be cruised in\r\ncomfort and safety. It is for this reason that the idea of cruiser / racer is going to be changed to out and out racer. To do this the same hull form will be used to produce a high specification race boat that can compete with the likes of Farr 40’s, Mumm 36’s and other well-known race boats in this category.","bibo:AuthorList":["French, William"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.354503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106463,"sim:weight":0.250201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.245003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22948,"sim:weight":0.215031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154412,"sim:weight":0.197611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60447,"sim:weight":0.192021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.188136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.188136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.188136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.188136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.188136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.188136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.188136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.188136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.188136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.188136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.188136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.188136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.188136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.188136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The many unique aspects of the international maritime industry make the wholesale adoption of established criteria from another industry inappropriate. \r\n\r\nThis research sets out to identify whether the broad competence criteria described in the STCW revisions would be consistently interpreted by a range of industry stakeholders, in the context of the behaviours that they would expect to see, hear or experience in demonstrating compliance with, and evidencing competence in, the criteria.\r\n\r\nThe paper will report on areas where respondents clearly identified effective and ineffective behavioural markers.  Where such evidence was not forthcoming or requires amplification, the authors will propose effective and ineffective markers.

Preparation methods to achieve ideal conditions for secondary bonding are diverse and disputed. Although many processes have been tested and quantified by the aviation industry, procedures in the marine composite industry remain unregulated and varied. The purpose of this paper is to define a relative level of bonding integrity through testing a variation in surface preparation of composites. The effect of incorrect mix ratios in adhesive preparation is also investigated. A literature review of relevant information regarding secondary bonding techniques and related issues is made. Conclusions from the tests made and current information available is used to propose a relative superior method for preparation and application of secondary bonds in composites.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hudson, Allan"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98541,"sim:weight":0.217331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.214567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45218,"sim:weight":0.195184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.186373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.186373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.186373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.186373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.186373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.186373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.186373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.186373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.186373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.186373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.186373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.186373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.186373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.186373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.178684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.177156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18164,"sim:weight":0.175493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This idea was then taken and used as one of three initial ideas and picked out for further development. Three weeks into the project, a final design proposal was submitted to the assigned tutors. Once feedback had been received from this, a preliminary design was created. The basis of this was to be very simple, but to outline all ideas that were to form the base of the hull design. This included a preliminary sail area, hull lines plan, general arrangement, initial structures and a deck plan. This lead to a formal presentation of all ideas in February 2003 to two lecturers. Feedback was given at the end of the each presentation, enabling more ideas to be considered and more areas of design to be attempted. These comments in mind, the last design leg was to complete all structural calculations, finalise a sail area, general arrangement, deck plan, promotional drawings, structural design and to discuss the development of the design.","bibo:AuthorList":["Baker, Eleanor Jane"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.339956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146140,"sim:weight":0.331413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.313229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.287087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.275156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22948,"sim:weight":0.27309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.271678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383501,"sim:weight":0.269209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154412,"sim:weight":0.255251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65603,"sim:weight":0.254767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105058,"sim:weight":0.251135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.250497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.245891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108738,"sim:weight":0.245753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48272,"sim:weight":0.233099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769042,"sim:weight":0.230195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.230099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1656477,"sim:weight":0.229472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.226983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99250,"sim:weight":0.223573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The main concept is to imagine an environmentally friendly powered boat first by reducing the entreaty of the generator by using solar cells ,photovoltaic panels and horizontal or vertical wind turbines. The coupling of both systems,(sun and wind) , will produce enough energy for the comfort of life. This concept boat leads directly to a coastal laboratory for primary research sailing boat. The vessel should have comfortable accommodations for 2 skippers and 4 scientists ( accounting that the scientists onboard are already experimented sailing people ).\r\nThe vessel will include glass panels under the hull working with structural and moving doors once arrived in shallow water. The role envisaged of the vessel should include research works at sea such as archeology and oceanography in shallow water.(Marine wild life logging, photography, filming, primary analysis and scuba-diving activity). The vessel will also be used as a form of transport for a light amount of samples so the vessel would include a crane to carry objects out of water, and as a base for land research expeditions into areas which are difficult to access and which needs relatively small vessel draught to be investigated.

It all started from a design contest organized by the Norway Multihull Association in May 2002 which goal was to promote a fast and exiting cruiser racer multihull with a limited cost of construction. This contest appears to enlighten an area of the pleasure boat market in which there is a lack of choice in existing designs but which is increasingly taking the attention of the public.\r\nThe philosophy of the project was there and the area of research could then be set up. The first step was an investigation on sailing cruiser racer multihulls. The water plan of Southampton Water and its multihull series gave some light on the way trimarans are sailing and which are the successful designs. The conclusions so far were that such kind of boats should be more famous because they propose a really fun alternative to club series and short cruising.\r\nThe second step was to investigate on design considerations specific to multihulls through literature and designers advices. The study covered the whole modern history of sailing on several hulls, from the early ‘racing’ proa to the latest high tech machines which represent a very dynamic field for experimentation.\r\nThe next step was to investigate on construction methods and materials to use to bring the price down. With no much compromise on the performance and looking of the final product, the way forward was to propose a self build boat using modern methods of construction.\r\nOnce these main objectives were identified, the design spiral could be primed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Eustache, Benjamin"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.308095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.29717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.29717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.29717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.29717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.29717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.29717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.29717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.29717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.29717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.29717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.29717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.29717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.29717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.29717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.296455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.290332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.271965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108738,"sim:weight":0.271179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.269748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

By investigating the hydrodynamic behaviour of the hydrofoil borne boat, it has been possible to construct a hydrodynamic model. A simpler aerodynamic model has been constructed and, by applying a solver function in Excel, the force and moment equilibrium of the system was found, and a polar plot was produced from the results.\r\nTowing tank testing has been performed with the aim of validating the designed hydrofoil configuration and the methods used in the construction of the velocity prediction program. It was found that the foil configuration was working as intended, and that the methods applied in the velocity prediction was slightly underestimating the drag of the hydrofoil borne boat.\r\nIt was also found that a flow separation occurred on the hydrofoils during the tank testing, and an investigation of cavitation and ventilation inception has therefore been carried out. It was found that the problem with cavitation and ventilation does not scale up, and that ventilation will occur at higher Froude Numbers on the full size boat than it was the case with the model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Olsen, Nikolaj Grondahl"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4874254,"sim:weight":0.500841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4874253,"sim:weight":0.44778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4869000,"sim:weight":0.397089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4874252,"sim:weight":0.342186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9412456,"sim:weight":0.284225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27810,"sim:weight":0.256663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4873611,"sim:weight":0.218134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27230,"sim:weight":0.21593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.195749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890284,"sim:weight":0.191913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28346,"sim:weight":0.179694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387380,"sim:weight":0.170817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98504,"sim:weight":0.165355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31718,"sim:weight":0.163822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28340,"sim:weight":0.159342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890288,"sim:weight":0.15657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108758,"sim:weight":0.154363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890286,"sim:weight":0.153682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.149648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27905,"sim:weight":0.148847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The study was carried out by extensive research into manufacturing processes and materials and contemporary views on the subject of osmosis. It was found that the process of \"osmosis\" does not occur within FRP. The process that is causing damage is the process of \"Hydrolysis\" reacting between the water and the acids and glycols in the resin. This process caused the resin to break down and form Phthalic acid crystals, which further degrade the laminate.\r\nThe current repair methods, favoured by many marine repair companies, were found to be insufficient in dealing with the products of the \"hydrolysis\" process, and were in effect sealing the acidic crystals inside the laminate with the possibility of further damage going undetected. This problem could be avoided by the use of high temperature vacuum treatments to remove the products of \"hydrolysis\" before coating the hull.\r\nIn the case study vessel, the \"CONTESSA 32\", it was found that by changing from an isophthalic gelcoat to an isophthalic neopentyl glycol gelcoat, the laminate would posses increased resistance to water ingress at a minimal cost. This would increase both the appeal of the product and the sales value.","bibo:AuthorList":["Amey, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27903,"sim:weight":0.269594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102716,"sim:weight":0.263286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24911,"sim:weight":0.238561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.232184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.22738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.22738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.22738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.216142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45779,"sim:weight":0.208784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26001,"sim:weight":0.207583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386727,"sim:weight":0.203151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664603,"sim:weight":0.198445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99457,"sim:weight":0.191809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383492,"sim:weight":0.190442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101244,"sim:weight":0.189488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18164,"sim:weight":0.185438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22948,"sim:weight":0.181045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46973,"sim:weight":0.179193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43802,"sim:weight":0.178264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387205,"sim:weight":0.177374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the current market place, there are a remarkable number of commercial vessels currently available for sale at a very competitive price.\r\nThese vessels have become available for a wide variety of reasons which include changes in the market need, changes in crewing philosophy, or as part of planned replacement policy. Where some of them are unattractive in appearance, in need of major restorative repair or uneconomical to continue to operate – thus have become available to be scrapped. While there are always a significant number of existing yachts offered for sale, the appearance, standard of construction and the interior may not meet the desires of an owner. A conversion becomes only beneficial to the owner if the chosen vessel can be produced in a time and cost saving package compared to a new build.\r\nFor this purpose, “ANTARES” shown below, was a 1951 Dutch pilot and surveying vessel, which has been chosen to be used as a “donor” vessel for the conversion to an Explorer Yacht. This project identifies the main areas of concern for the conversion and uses the Maritime and Coastguard Agency code of practice for the safety of large commercial sailing \u0026 motor vessels to analyse and assess the situation.\r\nPlate 1 showing “ANTARES” in her present appearance\r\nProblems associated with stability, fire protection and cost estimation of such are discussed and solutions to the problems offered. An approach of project management based on research and the use of charts to produce a precedence diagram that shows the sequence of the conversion process, have also been produced. Furthermore, a final 3-D model has been created to show how the vessel could look like based on the conversion work required (See Appendix XIX, p. 90-91).\r\nAs a major design feature, which is a build in hangar that houses a helicopter, the need to compliance to the Safety of Life at Sea for the fire protection and system becomes a major issue which could affect the total cost of the vessel. The cost of conversion has been derived from a collection of 37 Explorer yachts that are represented in the form of a linear equation from a graph.\r\nThe converted vessel at the end shows all features an Explorer Yacht can offer and combines “vintage” with a modern touch. The result of the estimated cost and the time scale may show an ideal vessel waiting to be converted.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kozlik, OV"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.295246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.277286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.277286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.277286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.277286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.277286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.277286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.277286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.277286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.277286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.277286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.277286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.277286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.277286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.277286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.275176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.274508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.266006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664544,"sim:weight":0.259408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.258696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The 67 fleet, now twelve years old, has been superseded by a fleet of 72’ yachts. Several yachts have been sold to various organisations as training vessels. This study examines an alternative use.\r\nThe definition of a world cruising yacht has been examined, through the use of a parametric study. Although this provided some indication of what is required it was found to be rather ambiguous.\r\nIn an attempt to define a purpose to which the converted yacht could be specified, a passage plan for an extended cruise has been created. Some conclusions with regard to systems and equipment levels have been used to augment the information from the parametric study.\r\nBased on the information gathered, a specification has been created using manufacturers literature, drawings and information supplied by Challenge Business. Issues such as the addition of new systems, a new accommodation layout, vessel performance and behaviour, stability and the addition of watertight bulkheads have been considered and evaluated with the help of various software packages and guidance from the MCA code book for small commercial sailing vessels.\r\nTo carry out a conversion project as described has significant implications in terms of cost and the time required. These issues have been examined and an estimate of both has been made in conjunction with a proposal for the sequence in which it should be carried out. The basis for the estimate is information supplied by equipment manufacturers and input from industry specialists.\r\nThe study concludes that a conversion as proposed is viable. Total converted vessel cost is not prohibitive providing the specification exactly fulfils the owners requirements. However there is unlikely to be significant profit in the conversion itself if the yacht is to remain saleable. The converted vessel would have a ‘general’ specification not tailored to an owner and considerable capital would be tied up for the duration of the project. For these reasons it is considered ideal for Challenge to sell the yachts as vessels which are suitable for conversion but not to undertake the conversion themselves.","bibo:AuthorList":["Otton, William"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664656,"sim:weight":0.265219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.2636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.254516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.254516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.254516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.254516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.254516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.254516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.254516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.254516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.254516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.254516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.254516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.254516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.254516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.254516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108269,"sim:weight":0.250615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383342,"sim:weight":0.243628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84370,"sim:weight":0.240839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.23644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The success of this boat over the last four years is in part due to her being competitive under IMS, IRC and IRM rating rules, but also a credit to her quick and exciting sailing characteristics.\r\nThe Farr 52 OD is a moderate-to-light displacement race boat, built from pre-preg carbon and epoxy, vacuum bagged and heat cured. Features include a runnerless rig built by Hall spars, non-overlapping headsails by North Sails and twin grinding pedestals by Lewmar. The essence of this boat is performance, but a fact of life is that such performance is soon out-done on the racecourse. It is on this poignant point that I would like to investigate the viability of creating a successful and practical conversion for the Farr 52 from a high-performance and specialist race boat to a cruiser-racer, with the scope for competing in offshore cruising regattas.\r\n“There is a wonderful fascination about yacht designing because of the opportunity generally afforded the designer for the experiment toward improvement of type.” (Skene.

Although this vessel will not be a world cruiser by nature, it is intended that long ocean passages will be a joy and not a chore.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pritchard-Gordon, Sam"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.228893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106463,"sim:weight":0.220809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.197996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.197687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154412,"sim:weight":0.193369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.192744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58888,"sim:weight":0.18495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.184862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.184862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.184862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.184862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.184862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.184862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.184862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.184862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.184862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.184862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.184862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.184862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.184862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There are so many opposing views; it was felt that some research into the subject was warranted especially on wooden vessels. Starting with the history of copper as an antifouling agent, moving through various types of cladding and production using copper nickel, and finally to the state of the art, copper epoxy antifouling. Research into the knowledge in the public domain was carried out through the medium of a questionnaire. Some short term experiments were executed using samples of Copperguard a copper epoxy antifouling system. These experiments looked at the reliability, flexibility, and the level of galvanic corrosion on timber impaled with different metals, and other substances clad with Copperguard and immersed in sea water. It would appear from these short term samples that Copperguard may in fact help to prevent galvanic corrosion. Long term tests need to be performed to provide evidence over five, ten and twenty years before an absolute conclusion may be drawn.\r\nThere is a cost comparison between traditional antifouling and Copperguard over a ten year period.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Clive Martin"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26523,"sim:weight":0.39981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101340,"sim:weight":0.230465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105026,"sim:weight":0.179125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.140242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.140242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.140242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.140242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.140242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.140242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.140242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.140242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.140242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.140242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.140242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.140242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.140242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.140242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108424,"sim:weight":0.130787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.129382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.129382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The yachting industry in itself is a cottage industry, for some people it builds what is essential but for most is a luxury item. In recent decades, big companies and small companies alike have gone bankrupt, some with lack of work planned and some with full order books in hand. This can be a disaster for the communities that are affected by the job losses and loss of income to the community. This could have been caused by ineffective management practices, lack of morale, product life cycle, and most probably a mix of all of these. I’m going to investigate management practices and theories, and see whether they would have an impact on the companies to make them more efficient, friendly, and successful and ensure their long term life.\r\nTwo theoretical model companies were constructed, based on stereotypical yacht manufacturing companies and they are used to base the findings on. I picked ten areas of research to look into that are related to management, engineering principles, philosophies and team ethos. I have them applied these on to the model companies and thought about how they would work retrospectively on them. Some of them are very applicable to standard engineering management teams and some to smaller management systems.\r\nThe two companies both benefited from the thought and change made from the philosophies proposed, my first smaller model company theoretically could make huge changes to the way it works, a lot of it background work of the management side that would make it work more efficient, improving communication, more job planning, and a better work environment for the managers and staff. The second company I found is more executively based management already and benefits from some review and thought, and can also improve through quality accreditations and improved communication. It does however have to extremely aware of the product life cycles of the products it is building, and be flexible to meet their demands. The customer or client has to be considered and thought what he wants, but not at the expense of the downfall of the business.\r\nThis project theoretically designs the two model companies as they could improve as best it can in theoretical terms. In real life there would be other problems, and other issues may come along, what I have inbuilt into both designs is input to management levels from staff and improved communication, which is the only way these problems come into the open instead of coming out at the end of a project when it is too late. The manager of any company shouldn’t be someone who is unapproachable by his staff, and his floor managers should know what is going on and any problems, potential or current, with the staff in the company.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wiley, James Michael"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.42992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.420407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.41918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352145,"sim:weight":0.417427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.412951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.412951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.412951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.412951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.412951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.412951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.412951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.412951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.412951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.412951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.412951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.412951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.412951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.412951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383077,"sim:weight":0.409789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58839,"sim:weight":0.395565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The reason for choosing this topic was to grasp the first and probably last chance to work on TRIPPPLE COURTNEY, a boat where every aspect would be designed according to the author’s ideas, wishes and preferences. In this context, an important aspect of the project is reflected in the design philosophy:\r\n“TRIPPPLE COURTNEY shall be purposefully designed as high performance powerboat. It shall be able to offer thrills and excitement together with a high level of comfort both under way and at anchor. These qualities shall not express themselves in-, or be compromised by luxury.”\r\nDuring the course of the project, most areas relevant for a preliminary design have been covered. These included parametric study, weights and centres estimates using different techniques, resistance and powering estimates using different techniques, planing hull form design, planing hull detail design, structural design in aluminium and FRP, propulsion system design, intact and damaged stability analysis, classification society compliance, product research, styling, design of interior layout and design optimisation. Whilst all of these aspects have been addressed, they were only taken to a preliminary design stage. Cost was not considered in any part of the project.\r\nSavitsky planing theory, the DNV rules for structural design, MCA regulations for stability, Maxsurf®, Hydromax®, Hull Speed®, Wolfson powering prediction software, Rhinoceros®, AutoCAD®, the Microsoft® packages, Adobe Paint Shop Pro® and the knowledge and theory accumulated during the BEng “Yacht and Powercraft Design” degree were the most important tools used in the process.\r\nAfter two complete loops around the design spiral plus additional work in the areas of hull form design, powering and general arrangement, the most important design decisions had been made and a sensible result had been achieved. Only the fuel capacity and maximum range remained a problem. Neglecting this issue, the design had converged sufficiently to be able to say it could be taken to the detailed design stage.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heuser, Benjamin"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1146140,"sim:weight":0.390497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.371046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.355912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22948,"sim:weight":0.315178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383501,"sim:weight":0.30836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.295338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664544,"sim:weight":0.29271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.28676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.263375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.261559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271236,"sim:weight":0.256674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.246095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27905,"sim:weight":0.23273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.229967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.229967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.229967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.229967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.229967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.229967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.229967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The boat will be fuel efficient and\r\ncapable of long passage making at a medium speed. The motorboat will have to be designed to recreational craft directive standards (RCD).\r\nThe choice of a slender body hull form was chosen to provide a suitable platform to produce an efficiently powered motorboat that is more economical than the current\r\ntrend of motorboats. The current trend is to produce high volume motorboats with large interiors and reasonably heavy displacement, these requirements do not lend itself to an\r\nefficient hull form. Instead huge engines are required to push the boat to a top speed required by the owner, even though when cruising, the boat will not often operate at\r\nthe top speed because of the cost and limited range. The slender hull motorboat will not be capable of reaching the speeds capable by a planing motorboat but will have a\r\nsprint speed capability. The cruising speed of the slender hull is above that of a standard displacement cruising boat which for the size range is below 10kts. The idea is\r\nthat the slender hull form motorboat can cruise economically at a speed of 0.45-0.5 Froude No (Fn) with a range making it possible to larger distances. The sprint speed is there for short journeys where fuel efficiency is not so important and increases the possibility of travelling to further locations in a short time, which is one of the advantages of a planing motorboat.\r\nThe motorboat will be designed to be comfy, a stable for offshore cruising, it will have berths to accommodate up to 6 people with separate showers and head for each cabin.\r\nWith a slender body hull form the volume per length is less this makes the accommodation a factor in the decision of the overall length of the vessel. The project looks at layout options to optimise the interior space and flow, making it user friendly and supplying adequate room.\r\nWith a slender hull, stability is one of the major issues that have been looked into, RCD\r\nhave criteria that needs to be met, the project looks at the effect of varying the waterline beam and the vertical centre of gravity and where the limits in the hull form\r\nare with minimum beam and VCG being found.\r\nWith part of the brief being an efficient hull form, resistance and propulsion were another important aspect of the project. Analysis of varying hull forms was undertaken\r\nusing Wolfson Powering Program to find the key factors affecting the resistance of the vessel.\r\nThe Final Vessel came to a length of 20.2m overall and beam of 4.75m, it has a cruise speed of 13 knots and a range of 1017nm. It meets the criteria for the both range and\r\nspeed and also supplies accommodation for 6 people. The vessel also passed RCD stability requirements for Category A.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dixon, Matthew"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.39245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23730,"sim:weight":0.311362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.301801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27905,"sim:weight":0.301028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271236,"sim:weight":0.281628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.280554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75597,"sim:weight":0.277151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.269112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.232537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.232537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.232537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.232537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.232537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.232537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.232537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.232537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.232537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.232537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.232537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.232537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The new production focuses on the manufacturing techniques used and the management strategies put in place to ensure the production runs smoothly and a high quality vessel is produced. The current economic climate has created the need for streamlining of manufacturing cost and investigation into how the production can be made more efficient, the original and new productions are compared to see what savings can be made through materials and labour.\r\nThe limited production run is a viable endeavour as there is an emerging market for boats that are more economical, useable in more weather conditions and can be taken further than the average motor yacht.

However, inadequate research has been undertaken into this topic within developing or underdeveloped countries. This study has evaluated the potential for stakeholders’ collaboration as a key factor in the prospects for Community Based Ecotourism (CBE) in coastal areas of Pakistan.\r\n\r\nCore concepts of strategic analysis and collaboration theory were applied to case studies and field research. Sustainable practices were identified from three selected CBE case studies (Ulugan Bay, Philippines; Operation Wallacea, Indonesia and Kaikoura District Council, New Zealand), all of which champion stakeholder collaboration in their operations. Field level research was carried out in Pakistan to identify gaps in sectoral management approaches to tourism. Attributes observed within all the three case studies were then critically compared with the situation in Pakistan. In order to explore CBE potential as a viable option for coastal tourism in Pakistan, an assessment of ecologically sensitive coastal areas for their potential in CBE together with an assessment of the stakeholder environment for collaboration in CBE was undertaken.\r\n\r\nApplication of the first exercise to seven ecologically sensitive coastal areas (Jiwani, Miani Hor, Pasni-Astola Island, Harjana Village Bamboor, Kaka Pir Village, Mubarak Village and Keti Bandar) identified two major issues of concern. Namely how to avoid external threats for establishing CBE at each destination and how to access regional opportunities for developing CBE. With respect to second exercise, the stakeholder environment of Sindh Province was assessed for essential preconditions to enable stakeholders’ collaboration in CBE. Notwithstanding some major positive attributes of collaboration, the existing power based approach was considered to be a major obstacle.\r\nIn order to conceptualise collaboration theory application to CBE in Pakistan, results of the empirical research into the stakeholders’ environment of Sindh were evaluated using a three-stage model of collaboration. The model was advanced through six propositions and the need for the model to recognise practical issues, biodiversity resources and scenic assessment values was identified. \r\n\r\nIn order to successfully establish stakeholders’ collaboration in CBE in coastal areas of Pakistan the collaboration model recommended optimum conditions such as the inclusion of broad range of stakeholders; identification of a suitable convenor; application of a ‘search conference’; strategic repositioning of stakeholders and finally, establishing a collaborative organisation structure.\r\nThis research concluded that selected rural coastal locations in Pakistan offer an alternative to unsustainable urban tourism on the beaches close to Karachi. Furthermore, the contextual environment of Sindh Province has a potential for stakeholders’ collaboration in CBE, but this is currently thwarted by stakeholders’ power based approach and the political instability of the country. Further work is needed to establish whether such a model could be applied elsewhere in the developing world.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ullah, Zia"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.229927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101516,"sim:weight":0.221559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101270,"sim:weight":0.203704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45170,"sim:weight":0.197831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.197746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.197746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.197746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.197746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.197746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.197746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.197746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.197746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.197746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.197746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.197746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.197746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.197746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.197746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664638,"sim:weight":0.191829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664716,"sim:weight":0.189377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Perception of aesthetics takes place both during the design\r\nprocess when the designer creates a form, and later, through the users’\r\ninterpretation of the form. Within the perception process, association plays a\r\nsignificant role. This paper addresses the stage research results of our exploration\r\ninto the associative meanings of a product. By analysing the evaluation of a series of\r\ntop award winning designs, it was found that some associative meanings\r\n(represented by descriptive words) are correlated, such as ‘pure-architecturalgeometrical’,\r\n‘delicate-curvaceous-organic’ etc. By conducting a series of\r\nworkshops, both in the UK and China, we have been able to explore the extent to\r\nwhich young designers are able to manipulate form, style and create an overall\r\nperception of a positive aesthetic. One of the main outputs during the workshops\r\nwas to design a MP3 player with speaker units, styled in line with three topics of\r\naesthetic association: topic 1 – pure, architectural, geometrical and technical; topic 2 – curvaceous, organic, and fun; topic 3 – graceful, cheerful, and powerful. Three non-correlated associative descriptors were deliberately used in topic 3. Results suggest that young designers tend to differ in their ability and success of manipulating form to match different aesthetic targets. When the descriptive words in one aesthetic topic are correlated, student designers seem to find it easier to manipulate the form matching the topic. Comparative analysis between the results from the workshops in the UK (Southampton Solent University) and in China\r\n(Tsinghua University) is also presented in the paper.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Mark"],"dc:date":"2007-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Hengfeng Zuo and Mark Jones.

Structured interviews of managers were analysed to deduce implications for the design of group assignments in universities. Participants were 10 managers from 10 organisations, 7 of which rank in the Times top 100 UK graduate employers. Themes that emerged included the idea that tight deadlines necessitate group-work, that communication within and between groups is essential, that group identity is important, and that leadership has important implications. These themes could be applied by giving university group assignments tighter deadlines than individual assignments, by providing tools to encourage communication within student groups (e.g. online information-sharing tools, and group logs to record details of meetings), encouraging student groups to develop a collective identity, and by encouraging student groups to choose a leader. It was concluded that group assignments in universities could be designed to better mirror conditions in real organisations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kamau, Caroline","Spong, Abigail"],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4162739,"sim:weight":0.259337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.236391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151558,"sim:weight":0.222882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162458,"sim:weight":0.220504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709519,"sim:weight":0.212082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78564,"sim:weight":0.21191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.211845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85579,"sim:weight":0.206567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654023,"sim:weight":0.205171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.199171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.19558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.191343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187733,"sim:weight":0.188101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383619,"sim:weight":0.187793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.186702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104691,"sim:weight":0.18466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269880,"sim:weight":0.184245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104853,"sim:weight":0.183008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.177708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1153659,"sim:weight":0.17693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This concept has increasingly become popular as the market has become over saturated with standard high\r\nvolume cruisers.\r\nThe main objective of the project was to set a definitive design brief from which a basis hull could be decided upon. Research was then carried out into similar concepts to see what problems are present and why. Many problems were\r\nidentified including the tenderness of these yachts and therefore the need for a low centre of gravity and potentially greater beam. It was recognised stability\r\ncould therefore pose problems to the project along with the lack of interior space that is present in a classic hull form.\r\nThe aim was to analyse these problems and improve upon them through the use of a design spiral process; working to design a new concept which takes benefits from both classic and modern design. The yacht is to be a one-off production\r\nwhich is built using wood composite construction. Wood is lightweight, easy to work and is a natural sustainable material. Boats have been built from wood for centuries, and for that reason people have a respect for it and aesthetically it is very much appreciated. Together with the use of modern adhesives and fastenings it is possible to build a wooden structure lighter than a composite structure for the equivalent density. Furthermore with careful structural design it is possible to design a structure which is compliant to RCD category A assessment making it suitable for offshore racing/ cruising should the owner desire to do so.\r\nIt is believed that the market is becoming more and more lucrative for modern/classic designs with the recent and on-going restoration of many of the J class yachts.\r\nTogether with the performance qualities that are obtainable, sustainability and aesthetical quality there is a place for these yachts within the modern market place. Many people want to own their own wooden classic yacht – especially with the benefit of a modern high draft bulb keel and high modulus carbon/aramid laminate sails.","bibo:AuthorList":["Page, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":106463,"sim:weight":0.426351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.333114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.326015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.319047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.296102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6200938,"sim:weight":0.293878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.283783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.283783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.283783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.283783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.283783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.283783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.283783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.283783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.283783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.283783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.283783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.283783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.283783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.283783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The paper attempted to address as many areas of the design as possible, ranging from initial hull design to interior design, to a possible structural layout. At all times the project had an eye to compliance with modern rules and regulations and attempted to cast a common sense eye over all portions. The design utilised market research and data from previous designs, as well as general naval architecture knowledge as a basis for the new yacht. During the design process an attempt was made to break away from the normal and mediocre, and utilise novel ideas, some new, and some transferred from other applications. The final design is aimed to be an easily constructed, easily repaired vessel; where no frill meets comfort, and is highly commercially viable. This was achieved by utilising a chined aluminium construction, a yawl sailplan, and focusing on large open spaces throughout the yacht. A large yet sleek glass superstructure gives the yacht a unique visual and aesthetic. The yacht met the majority of its design aims, and more importantly the legal regulations for safety that would be applied to it if built.","bibo:AuthorList":["Grady, Todd"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1146140,"sim:weight":0.32959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3170,"sim:weight":0.314938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.308545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.298776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54103,"sim:weight":0.276342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.242117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664544,"sim:weight":0.23855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22948,"sim:weight":0.23608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383501,"sim:weight":0.23503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.234181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.233668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.224361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.224361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.224361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.224361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.224361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.224361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.224361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.224361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.224361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

South Africa\u0027s current energy security was analysed in the wake of the load shedding to attempt to establish whether there was a viable opportunity to import LNG to South Africa for power generation purposes. It was established that there was an opportunity to import LNG for possibly mid-merit or peaking power generation demand. The future prominent role of shale gas is introduced as are the current issues relating to the\r\nextraction of the unconventional gas.\r\nThe LNG market was assessed to demonstrate the increasing flexibility within contracts and the decreased unit costs along the supply chain, this was important to demonstrate that contracts are generally becoming more favourable for the buyer.\r\nThe previous chapters firstly highlighted the issues of South Africa\u0027s energy security and assessed how LNG was becoming more accessible to a wider market scope. The\r\nimplications of importing LNG in a South African context were determined as power generation related. Gas fired power plants were analysed and possible demand scenarios were established for power generation. Security of supply was analysed as the theme for importing LNG revolves around increased energy security for the importer, it had been established and well known in South Africa that energy security is a current and major issue.\r\nFinally Regasification Structures were firstly introduced and then comparatively analysed. Offshore structure quite clearly suit South Africa possible demand in terms of the following factors.\r\n• Shale Gas and Coal Fired Power Generation\r\n• Location Flexibility\r\n• Throughput and Storage.\r\n• Commission and Decommissioning Process.\r\nThe criterion helped identify major factors that would influence the regasification structure selection.","bibo:AuthorList":["Campbell, Duncan"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5083241,"sim:weight":0.366735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5083479,"sim:weight":0.365053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5086482,"sim:weight":0.359473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5082088,"sim:weight":0.350966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386659,"sim:weight":0.347805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147808,"sim:weight":0.337603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5074587,"sim:weight":0.310292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5076839,"sim:weight":0.308441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5079146,"sim:weight":0.305056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5074588,"sim:weight":0.3018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":479,"sim:weight":0.293324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5082077,"sim:weight":0.292659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5074586,"sim:weight":0.287109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108959,"sim:weight":0.264958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5077008,"sim:weight":0.264378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103157,"sim:weight":0.26128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5082067,"sim:weight":0.256349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60610,"sim:weight":0.249472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5092493,"sim:weight":0.247155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586821,"sim:weight":0.245768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The essential overlap between the methods offers clear benefits in the HE environment. In consideration of the aspects of KM and kaizen, various potential opportunities were identified as targets for improvement, and clarified by knowledge audit as to value and viability. The derived outcomes are listed along with some of the principal factors and perceived barriers in the practical implementation of the outcomes.\r\n\r\nKnowledge audit applied here focused on the identification of where value arises within the business. Resource constraints and the practicalities of a people-centred system limit the permissible rate of innovation, so precise focus on the areas of business activity of most significance to the mission and client base is crucial. The fundamental question of whether such a strategy should be developed as a separate strand or embedded into existing strategies is discussed. In practice, Solent has chosen to embed, principally for reasons of maintenance of ownership and commitment.\r\n\r\nConfidence in the process has been built through prior success with trialled activities around retention, where an activity-based pedagogic framework was adopted to address issues with an access course. Other areas of early intervention include the development and reengineering of recruitment and admissions processes, and the development of activities and pedagogy based on the virtual learning environment as exemplars of the importance of cyclical feedback in continuous improvement. The inherent complexity of processes running across the university as an organisation offers opportunities for benefits from the through-process approach implicit in kaizen. The business value of the institution is in the skills of its employees and its deployed intellectual property, and thus the importance of the enhancement of both tangible assets and intangible processes is critical to future success.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rees, Stephen John","Protheroe, Huw"],"dc:date":"2009-04","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K Andrews.

The potential benefits of such\r\ntransfer include; reduction in the cost, avoiding double handling of the soil and reduction in carbon footprint of organisations’ involved in uncontaminated soil management.\r\n\r\nThe research was facilitated by three workshop meetings with attendance from 35 industry professionals from selected organisations operating across the supply-chain and industry sectors, i.e. civil engineering, house-building, ground-works contractors, and waste handlers/hauliers. Survey questionnaires were utilised to obtain soil exchange specific information,barriers and awareness of existing online exchange systems. The key\r\nbarriers in the direct soil exchange included: Regulations/ Legislation complexity; timing of soil availability and requirement and lack of visibility of supply chain (lack of information about the availability of soil and demand). Existing online soil exchange systems were regarded as having limited use due to complexities in data input, lack of auto-update of information and unavailability of right quantity at the right time. A common standard for identification of the suitability of uncontaminated soil in terms of both quality processes and chemical composition of soil is seen as essential.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marasini, Ramesh","Bralee, Steve","Brown, Phil","Price, Daniel Alistair"],"dc:date":"2012-02-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664526,"sim:weight":0.601645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98863,"sim:weight":0.572536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15065,"sim:weight":0.48013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.435417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.412024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.412024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.412024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.412024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.412024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.412024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.412024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.412024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.412024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.377982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.377539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":716697,"sim:weight":0.347913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":727384,"sim:weight":0.347913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":894314,"sim:weight":0.342063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":897639,"sim:weight":0.341073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":758551,"sim:weight":0.327457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Moreover, sites that don’t seem mired in controversy [such as the waterfronts of Ostend and Liverpool] will be shown to be deeply involved and, so, requiring cogent management of the tourist experience.\r\n\r\nThe paper will use the examples and draw upon the current debate to focus the audience’s attention to the critical factors that will be at the heart of the models and approaches adopted in the coming years.","bibo:AuthorList":["Parry, Bryn"],"dc:date":"2009-04-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101270,"sim:weight":0.572721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101516,"sim:weight":0.534764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.511107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340553,"sim:weight":0.413449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108754,"sim:weight":0.403725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.391593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.372697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931333,"sim:weight":0.309231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387059,"sim:weight":0.307991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46489,"sim:weight":0.288114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81396,"sim:weight":0.280295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.225387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.20937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.20937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.20937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.20937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.20937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.20937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.20937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.20937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper utilises the case study of a military museum to critically evaluate the options available when seeking to present an effective experience for a medium-sized museum, to a diverse range of audiences.\r\n\r\nUniting perspectives and developments from a range of paradigms [such as Museum Studies, Facilities Management and Information Technology], this case study demonstrates how the `cutting edge’ of the mainstream Tourism sector and that of the Dark Tourism sector compare and contrast. \r\n\r\nThe specific solutions presented provide benchmarks for addressing the commercial, practical and ethical constraints of creating and sustaining something as ethereal as tourist experiences; especially, when one is faced with the type of starkly opposing motivations found when seeking to present the kind of contested heritage that is central to a military museum – something made more challenging when faced with the multiple interpretations required for different age groups and cultures.\r\n\r\nWhilst drawing on academic concepts, the focus of this paper is firmly on the application of emerging solutions that are likely to be central to those managing tourist experiences in the next few years and over the coming decade","bibo:AuthorList":["Baker, Clive","Parry, Bryn"],"dc:date":"2009-04-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The objectives are twofold – first to utilise advances of Knowledge Management in education and second to teach the students in Virtual Communities as a powerful modern model for Knowledge Management. According to the classics [Rheingold, 2000] in this field a virtual community (also known from the literature as e-community or online community) is a group of people (presumably remotely distributed) that interact via some form of remote communications such as letters, telephone, email, or Internet rather than face to face. In modern network environment we can see also online communities where members are available simultaneously. With regard to the used media in online communities could be differentiated text, audio, visual and multimedia communities. The concept of ‘sticky’ virtual community refers to ones where repeated interactions (visits to websites as common place) require particular features in design to support and retain interest. Regular change in content, ability to use as a reference site, superior linkage to other resources, efficient design and many other factors play a part. Virtual and online communities have also become a dominant form of communication between people who are engaged with computer-based work. A computer-mediated community (CMC) uses specific software to regulate the social substance of this interaction. Essential socio-technical change could arise from the liaison of heterogeneous Internet-based social networks. Dealing with social context needs to consider, also, psychological and other factors outside of basic technical design.\r\nThrough the study of this activity, students will be trained to design, implement and develop virtual communities in a given area by using modern networking and communication tools and techniques. \r\nThe article presents major elements and discusses expected learning outcomes, proposed learning and teaching strategy and determines areas of study. The article also describes criteria for assessment potential employability. Compatibility with existing units, software and library requirements are considered, as well.","bibo:AuthorList":["Penev, Kalin","Rees, John"],"dc:date":"2008-09-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.459274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109246,"sim:weight":0.445493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.409947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.399031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.394199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.373391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.370951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151792,"sim:weight":0.36876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9543594,"sim:weight":0.366291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.358021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.33692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.33692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.33692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.33692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.33692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.33692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.33692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.33692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.33692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.33692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":6200100,"ep:Repository":104,"dc:type":["Book Section","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"High Education: towards development of innovative human capital","bibo:abstract":"This article discusses an activity based approach for teaching and learning applied in Higher Education to the development of Human Capital capability. According to the Leif Edvinsson, in one of the classic works in the area of Knowledge Management, Human Capital plays a significant role in overall Intellectual Capital. “… Intellectual capital is the sum of structural capital and human capital. Human capital refers to the knowledge, skill, and experience of the employees. Structural capital refers to the extension and manifestation of human capital. It includes tangibles such as the information technology systems, brand and company images, customer databases, organizational concepts and manuals.” [Bucklew and Edvinsson, 1999]\r\nFrom other, social and economics points of view, Eva Gamarnikow and Antony Green summarised Human Capital thus: “In economic, capital refers to resources (whether financial or physical) that are used for the production of goods. It can also refer to all resources that bring in income. Social Capital and Human Capital are terms used in the social science to discuss analogous concepts with regard to social resources derived from social interaction (social capital) and individual development (human capital).“  [Gamarnicow, 2003]\r\nFor Higher Education in general, and for the development of activity based teaching and learning in particular, a comprehensive understanding of human capital is essential. Gamarnikow and Green clarify: “There are at least four ways of thinking about human capital. For economists, human capital has a specific, narrow meaning: It refers to the opportunity cost of individuals\u0027 or states\u0027 investing in education-forgone earnings plus the cost of education set against expectations of future (higher) earnings and economic productivity, respectively. At the other extreme, the term human capital is often as used merely as popular shorthand for education in general. \r\nThe two intermediate perspectives are much more critical and compare the human capital approach to education unfavourably with other approaches. The first of these critical perspectives focuses on the social role of education. … The other critical perspective focuses on the ways in which education operates at the level of the individual. It criticises the human capital approach for reducing education to the inculcation of marketable skills rather than taking a holistic approach and educating the whole person.“\r\nAs part of its strategic plans to support development of the Knowledge-based Economy, Southampton Solent University (SSU) aims to advance appropriate programmes of study. For this purpose an activity based approach for teaching and learning is in process of deployment at Faculty of Technology at SSU. \r\nThe article discusses definitions of Intellectual Capital, Human Capital, Social Capital, Knowledge Management and Knowledge, their interaction in the global information environment and in the particular context of Higher Education. It presents also the principles and design of an activity-based model for learning and teaching and relevant illustrations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Penev, Kalin","Rees, John"],"dc:date":"2009-04-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.331651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.321491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.296604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.287953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.287224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.280207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.280207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.280207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.280207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.280207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.280207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.280207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.280207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.280207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.280207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.280207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.280207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.280207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.280207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75281,"sim:weight":0.272775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

They cater for a variety of preferences, including video, audio, text based and multi-media options. The variety of approaches taken by the Library’s blended induction package will be demonstrated. From the standard type of induction such as physical, virtual, self-guided and audio tours, to the perhaps ‘less usual’ including an alternative library with roof garden and doughnut machine.\r\n\r\nWe will reflect on how all these approaches have worked together to assist new library users make the step up to this part of their information literate lives. In particular we would wish to differentiate between options appropriate to the induction stage, at which students are overcoming initial emotional barriers created by anxiety, and later stages when they are more receptive to, and better able to benefit from, in-depth e-literacy training. How this fits into the wider University “spiral induction programme” - a recently introduced system of spreading university induction over a number of weeks rather than cramming everything into a few hectic days - will also be considered. \r\n\r\nIn addition we will explore possible further research avenues such as ‘the doughnut line’ (a statistical measure) and a game based interactive learning experience designed to help overcome library anxiety.","bibo:AuthorList":["Collinson, Timothy","Williams, Alison"],"dc:date":"2006-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E Chan.

By looking at the processes from the initial artist\u0027s design through to its engraving and printing, and by establishing the interaction between the artist, author, publisher and engraver, this study will lead to a better understanding of both the economics and aesthetics of print production and determine the destination of these illustrated picture books by examining the relationship between the publisher and the public. Previous work on nineteenth-century topographical steel engraving has largely had a bibliographical rather than historiographical aim and has concentrated on the classification of images into regional units. Although useful these publications are not intended to be critical and do not lead to an understanding of the contextual background necessary to explain the enormous output and consumption of topographical steel-engraved books in the 1830s and 1840s.\r\n\r\nThe two leading specialist topographical print-publishers were the London firms of Fisher, Son \u0026 Co. and George Virtue. The early career of Henry Fisher as a master printer of mainly religious publications issued in numbers is examined, and this study shows how his innovative marketing, selling and distribution methods led to these being adopted by others in the publishing trade. His transition from publisher of religious numbers in Liverpool to leading publisher of illustrated topographical works in London is investigated for the first time. As no records, account books or archives appear to have survived, this dissertation is based on the substantial number of illustrated travel books with steel-engraved plates that both firms produced between 1829 and 1844 as well as correspondence from Robert Fisher to the Irish artist George Petrie, in which Fisher explains some of \u0027the peculiarities of our business\u0027.\r\n\r\nThe two most prolific designers of illustrations for topographical picture books in this period were Thomas Allom (1804-1872) who worked for Fisher, and William Henry Bartlett (1809-1854) who worked for Virtue. Their contribution to the field of topographical book illustration has largely passed unnoticed by art historians who question whether mass produced images can be valued as art. Allom and Bartlett are usually classified as jobbing topographical artists or, at best, as architectural draughtsmen. A secondary aim of this dissertation is to offer a counterbalance to this view and show that their art was more genuinely creative than merely reproductive and moreover that their motives for doing this work were far from being similar.","bibo:AuthorList":["M\u0027Kenzie-Hall, James"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":6200367,"ep:Repository":104,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Algorithms for sensor validation and multisensor fusion","bibo:abstract":"Existing techniques for sensor validation and sensor fusion are often based on analytical sensor models. Such models can be arbitrarily complex and consequently Gaussian distributions are often assumed, generally with a detrimental effect on overall system performance. A holistic approach has therefore been adopted in order to develop two novel and complementary approaches to sensor validation and fusion based on empirical data. The first uses the Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator to provide competitive sensor fusion. The new algorithm is shown to reliably detect and compensate for bias errors, spike errors, hardover faults, drift faults and erratic operation, affecting up to three of the five sensors in the array. The inherent smoothing action of the kernel estimator provides effective noise cancellation and the fused result is more accurate than the single \u0027best sensor\u0027. A Genetic Algorithm has been used to optimise the Nadaraya-Watson fuser design.\r\n\r\nThe second approach uses analytical redundancy to provide the on-line sensor status output μH∈[0,1], where μH\u003d1 indicates the sensor output is valid and μH\u003d0 when the sensor has failed. This fuzzy measure is derived from change detection parameters based on spectral analysis of the sensor output signal. The validation scheme can reliably detect a wide range of sensor fault conditions. An appropriate context dependent fusion operator can then be used to perform competitive, cooperative or complementary sensor fusion, with a status output from the fuser providing a useful qualitative indication of the status of the sensors used to derive the fused result.\r\n\r\nThe operation of both schemes is illustrated using data obtained from an array of thick film metal oxide pH sensor electrodes. An ideal pH electrode will sense only the activity of hydrogen ions, however the selectivity of the metal oxide device is worse than the conventional glass electrode. The use of sensor fusion can therefore reduce measurement uncertainty by combining readings from multiple pH sensors having complementary responses. The array can be conveniently fabricated by screen printing sensors using different metal oxides onto a single substrate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wellington, Sean"],"dc:date":"2002-07","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Agogino, K Goebel and S Alag.

Significant factors impacting on effectiveness which were not attributable to the individual included having the right people with the right decision-making remit appointed to the Strategic Co-ordinating Group (the SCG - formed by relevant agency representation when a major incident takes place); familiarity between SCG members; individual and organisational commitment to incident and exercise attendance and training; and adaption to inter-organisational cultural difference.\r\n\r\nIt was found that there is no centralised consistent training available for the SCG co-ordinators who chair the SCG, and for SCG members.  Individuals who do attend the available training are not formally assessed for competence.  Important lessons identified after major exercises are not centrally gathered and disseminated as a matter of course, which means that an extremely valuable repository of data is not optimised.","bibo:AuthorList":["Devitt, Katherine"],"dc:date":"2009-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":22830,"sim:weight":0.344988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383619,"sim:weight":0.336923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12984,"sim:weight":0.323749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9430950,"sim:weight":0.319954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780223,"sim:weight":0.299253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43029,"sim:weight":0.29207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156007,"sim:weight":0.286985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45967,"sim:weight":0.271345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187733,"sim:weight":0.26043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101256,"sim:weight":0.237835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.23688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.23688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.23688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.23688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.23688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.23688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.23688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.23688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.23688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.23688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In both cases the fuser is based on empirical data rather than analytical\r\nsensor models. Complementary sensor responses have been obtained by fabricating sensors using different metal\r\noxides. This approach provides some immunity to interference caused by the ionic composition of the solution being sensed. The Nadaraya-Watson estimator is shown to provide a useful alternative to the feedforward neural network for multisensor fusion where sensor distributions are unknown. Indicative test results are provided for the measurement of pH in printing ink. The results confirm that the fused results are more accurate than those obtained using the single best sensor, or simple fusion schemes such as averaging or majority voting.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wellington, Sean","Atkinson, John","Sion, Russ"],"dc:date":"2002-03","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J A Mihell and J K Atkinson.

The training of these operators to be competent in their work tasks, therefore, attains a high level of importance. The control of industrial processes often requires operators to undertake complex dynamic tasks. Cognitive science is attempting to explain the cognitive processes that underlie the behaviour of operators when carrying out these tasks. This paper will investigate the current theories concerning these cognitive processes and will discuss their implications toward the training of industrial process operators.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gatfield, David"],"dc:date":"1999","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J R Anderson.

At the base of the archipelago sits the country of Trinidad and Tobago, the industrial hub of the Caribbean with an\r\neconomy fueled by the oil and gas industries. With this Trinidad has the capability to support yacht construction, and both yacht and ship repair. With the current low in the global economy and with yachts being sold to Caribbean customers from the United States cheaply, it was undertaken to design a comfortable weekender powerboat for the local market to be produced in Trinidad.\r\nThe design intent is that of a fast comfortable motor cruiser with the ability to host 4 guests in separate double cabins for a long weekend cruise throughout the Caribbean. The vessel style is to be similar to that of\r\nthe Down East style lobster boats from Maine, USA. The vessel is to be easily constructed using simple production methods appropriate to the labor skill and industrial resources available at hand in the country. A comparison\r\nbetween different production technologies is undertaken in this study and the pros and cons of each weighed up aiding in the final decision.\r\nMaterial choice was governed as much by the structural\r\nrequirements of the vessel as it was by the proposed production method and the working environment. Boat builders were asked about general fiberglass boat construction; their opinions and practical knowledge in\r\nreinforcement laying up techniques and issues were taken into consideration for the laminate schedule of the vessel also.\r\nDifferent mould tools are identified within this study from mass production female mould tools, temporary female mould tools and finally male mould tools. Each type was considered for the production of this method and how it would lend its self to the chosen production technology.\r\nThe complexity of the hull shape in the aft end of this vessel required special attention and is identified later on with in the build philosophy document.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lambert, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2709917,"sim:weight":0.346302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106463,"sim:weight":0.326893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44402,"sim:weight":0.323473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101376,"sim:weight":0.30636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.291354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.277397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.277397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.277397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.277397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.277397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.277397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.277397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.277397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.277397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.277397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.277397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.277397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.277397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.277397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.269846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":6200504,"ep:Repository":104,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The structure and nature of English local government 1834 - 2004","bibo:abstract":"In a drive to make local government as interesting and popular as generations of Westminster\u0027s politicians have believed it ought to be, the reform of local government as become as English an obsession as the weather.  Throughout the 20th century a range of subjective criteria have been developed to justify reorganisations of local government, along with increasingly complex models of how subjective measures can be used to justify change.  The complex and time-consuming procedures that characterised the 1929 \u0027review\u0027 of local government were compounded by a layer of additional complexity in the, eventually abandoned, review of 1945.  By then the development of urban spatial planning as a discipline had given policy makers a renewed optimism in their ability to effect scientific change, and the complexity of post war local government reorganisation increased incrementally.\r\nThe Government in 1992 and again in 2003, avoided the question of identifying what the purpose of local government was, and establishing cross-party consensus on how it might be established.  Instead, local administration has become synonymous with local democracy, whilst being referred to under a generic title of \u0027local government\u0027.  Proposals to reform one have created concerns regarding the future of the other.  This confusion, along with a general lack of interest by the general public has led to a scenario where government ministers have become defenders of the status quo, or champions of change, but rarely informed arbitors of reform.\r\nWith the benefit of 170 years of evidence to draw from, objectives that stood little chance of success remain stated outcomes of local government reform.  It will be shown that fanciful claims have not been consigned into the dustbin of history, but have incrementally produced heirs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Connelly, John"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43523,"sim:weight":0.407892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44343,"sim:weight":0.290018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18127,"sim:weight":0.265857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090413,"sim:weight":0.264084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710223,"sim:weight":0.260866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43834,"sim:weight":0.255863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709917,"sim:weight":0.252361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.250852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43675,"sim:weight":0.249874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.249456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45306,"sim:weight":0.242575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.24123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.24123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.24123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.24123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.24123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.24123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.24123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.24123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.24123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":6200509,"ep:Repository":104,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Sustainabilty systems appraisal for integrated coastal zone management","bibo:abstract":"Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) is a process defined in terms of achieving sustainable development.  Despite sustainability being accepted by the majority of organizations currently operating on the coast, the integrated approach is seen as the more constructive and benificial alternative to achieve this state.  Id \u0027success\u0027 for ICZM means sustainable development, then the question is raised as to how it attempts to achieve this, and, more speficically, how effectively it does so?  Put another way, how can the management process be evaluated in terms of achieving its aims?  Despite sevaral attempts to produce sustainability indicator sets, there is currently no established or validated way of assessing the effectiveness of ICZM initiatives and consequently there is also no national overview with thish to judge the strategic performance of coastal partnerships (CPs).  This study aims to address this failing by developing and critically evaluating a standardised operating mechanism for assessing the ability of ICZM initiatives to achieve sustainable development.\r\nIn order to develop this \u0027Coastal Sustainability Standard\u0027, a review was made of the current role and treatment of sustainability in coastal planning and management in the UK.  Using the electronic database of the company \u0027Coastal Management for Sustainability\u0027 (CMS), a survey of UK coastal practitioners was carried out as to the key theoretical constructs inherent in the concept of sustainability.  Textual analysis of the results, using the qualitative software package, Nud*ist 6, revealed six dominant constructs which would form the basis for the development of the standard.  These six - planning; participation; communication; integration; responsibility and balance were defined as principles, and a set of criteria developed for each, with which to enable assessment.  A scoring system and a set of guidelines were then designed to maximise the level of objectivity in carrying out the assessment, with the scoring system also reflecting the systems thinking inherent in the design.\r\nIn order to validate the mechanism, three case study CPs were selected against which to carry out a detailed application of the Standard.  These were the Exe Estuary Management Partnership (EEMP); Tamar Estuaries Consultative Forum (TECF) and Pembrokeshire Coastal Forum (PCF), all of which scored relatively poorly.  That none of the three CPs achieved the pre-requisite standard raised a number of considerations relating to the efficacy of the Standard and its operation, as well as to the nature of ICZM in the UK and its aim of achieving sustainable development.\r\nConclusions drawn from this evaluation identified that the current operation of ICZM in the UK exhibits a disjointed approach to achieving its long-term goals, as a result of its voluntary nature.  The voluntary approach employed in the UK can be seen to be at the root of a number of problems facing the successful development of ICZM.  In terms of resources, it has implications for the skills, knowledge and training of coastal managers, as well as the funding available to develop and implement effective plans.  The voluntary approach also does not necessarily \u0027encourage\u0027 appropriate cultural changes within or between stakeholder organizations, and does not impart joint responsibility or collective liability upon stakeholders to achieve sustainable development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gallagher, Anthony W"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84410,"sim:weight":0.486202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101350,"sim:weight":0.362958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664638,"sim:weight":0.341897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.320964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.320964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.320964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.320964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.320964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.320964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.320964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.320964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.320964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.320964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.320964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.320964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.320964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.320964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664656,"sim:weight":0.298695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84604,"sim:weight":0.295689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14787,"sim:weight":0.291413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is proposed that although each theory appears to oppose the other, they can be synthesised to form a reflexive, mutually supportive and flexible discursive theoretical framework that can be effectively applied to the process of migration and its resultant social formations.\r\nThe research theoretically considers the social delineation of such groups, the internal processes of group formation, and the significance of wider points of identity and belonging within group construction.  It is found that the experiential process of migration is only made meaningful in relation to the current social world that both groups exist within and the subjective meanings of individuals collected within each group.  Such subjective elements of knowledge often focus upon points of origin and current manifestations of identity.\r\nThe research is based upon 12 months of residential fieldwork using methods of participant opservation and various forms of interviewing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rayner, Nick"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101479,"sim:weight":0.380442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98865,"sim:weight":0.308133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102733,"sim:weight":0.305842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103117,"sim:weight":0.292347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101381,"sim:weight":0.280225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383571,"sim:weight":0.26694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57230,"sim:weight":0.265546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2881,"sim:weight":0.262888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108887,"sim:weight":0.261352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.241454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229908,"sim:weight":0.240003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43963,"sim:weight":0.238922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386250,"sim:weight":0.237649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53693,"sim:weight":0.237501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44798,"sim:weight":0.234588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447316,"sim:weight":0.227612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187687,"sim:weight":0.225578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584852,"sim:weight":0.222477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187492,"sim:weight":0.221074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46613,"sim:weight":0.218365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":6200551,"ep:Repository":104,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Building the modern corporation: corporate art patronage in interwar Britain","bibo:abstract":"This thesis examines art and architecture commissioned by three large-scale industrial corporations in Britain in the interwar period 1919-1939.  The companies studies are the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, later to become British Petroleum (BP), Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and Unilever.  The main focus of attention is on the  headquarters office buildings constructed in London and their sculptural decoration.  Attention is also paid to artwork used by Unilever on the covers of its in-house magazine \u0027Progress\u0027 and in its advertisements.  A laboratory built by ICI near Manchester is also considered.\r\n\r\nThe form and meaning of the works of art are examined using evidence of the relationships between the artists and the patrons, those within the companies who commissioned the works, as it is documented in the archives of the companies.  Evidence is also taken from the published histories of the companies, the response of critics as revealed in contemporary publication, and the recent history of the appropriate genres and of the individual artists.\r\n\r\nArt history is currently undertaking a reappraisal of 20th century British art rejecting the view that the significant art was either, on the one hand, that which belonged to some canon of modernist work, or, on the other, only that which remained true to some view of what was traditionally British.  This thesis makes a contribution to that re-appraisal.  The approach of examining the mechanisms of patronage has not been applied extensively before to this period and place.  In the process much new material about individual artists has been uncovered.  In addition by suing the large-scale corporation as its framework, the study has thrown light on one of the major social changes of the period, the growth of a new professional class.  This new class, whose habitat was the large bureaucracy, was developing an ideology of rationality and progress by technology which was to help shape 20th century attitudes and 20th century art.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wardleworth, Dennis"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5225608,"sim:weight":0.421415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.361552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43596,"sim:weight":0.36005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929874,"sim:weight":0.351587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382030,"sim:weight":0.350881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880843,"sim:weight":0.32132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710674,"sim:weight":0.319486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.316018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9019051,"sim:weight":0.313216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43713,"sim:weight":0.30931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46605,"sim:weight":0.305007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.302821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387394,"sim:weight":0.297435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.292099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930473,"sim:weight":0.287031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.28341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.28341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.28341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.28341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383629,"sim:weight":0.283175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This thesis examines empirically, the relationship between market orientation and business performance in the context of the machine tool industry based in the UK.  A more comprehensive market orientation scale was redeveloped by conducting comparative analysis of three previously developed market orientation scales with a view to make it an industry specific measure.  The unit of analysis used in the study is at individual firm level.  In the analysis, it was discovered that there are four significan latent dimensions underlying market orientation.  These dimensions were labelled as customer focus, competitors focus, customer satisfaction focus and marketing focus.  Next, the influence of each dimension on performance was assessed.  Findings suggest that customer focus and customer satisfaction focus have a stronger impact on performance than the other dimensions.  It was also revealed that competitor orientation has a U-shape relationship with performance in the short term but a positive linear relationship in the long term.  The findings caution against overemphasising competitive influences to the neglect of distinct capabilities of firms.  In order to find out if the strength of relationship between market orientation-performance is moderated by environmental factors, it was learnt that the hypothesised relationship is stronger when market turbulence and technology turbulence is low; and competitive intensity is high.  Managers could use the multidimensional conceptualisation to develop particular kinds of orientation required for better performance.

{"identifier":6200634,"ep:Repository":104,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Software quality and software process improvement in teleworking environments","bibo:abstract":"Telework as a swift developing business has attracted great attention from government, company and organisation due to its large benefits for out society.  A study was accordingly conducted to investigate its application in the IT industry.  Results show that teleworking is widely accepted by and plays an important role in software industry.  With the rapid development in computer and telecommunications technology, telework has become increasingly populat and can not be avoided in IT industry.  the benefits and problems brought by teleworking in IT industry are then reported in the study.  It is found that the big obstruction for telework development in software engineering is still product quality problems.\r\nAs many researchers have revealed, our society has entered the information society.  The demand for more and more software products with better  and better quality is increasing.  However problems of software quality hinder the development of the IT industry.  The recognised reason for this is the inability to manage the software process.  Hence, many software process assessment and improvement models have been developed and used successfully in the management of software development in order to acquire improvements in software quality.  However, the problem considered here is whether they are suitable for telework software development.\r\nTo build the necessary ground knowledge for carrying out this project, an extensive analysis of the fundamental methodology and principles of existing software process assessment and improvement models was conducted.  The strengths and weaknesses of these models are derived from the analysis.  The applicability and adaptability of the models for teleworking environments are also explored.  It is found that the existing models are designed for centralised software development.  They are not fully suitable but the same functions are applicable for teleworking environments.  The results of above discussion lead to the selection and recommendation of SPICE to be used as a baseline for the development of a process approach which meets the need of teleworking software environments.\r\nTo lay a solid foundation for the development of such approach, two surveys were carried out.  Their aims are investigate the current state of telework in IT industry and the applicability of the present models in teleworking environments, and to identify the specific issues which arise in telework.  It can be observed from the survey that there are significant differences in software process and management methodologies between telework and conventional single-site work.  Special technologies are needed to support telework software development.\r\nTo provide valuable input in the development of such approach, an in-depth analysis of the specific requirements identified from the survey results in the creation of a set of processes and base practices, which are particularly required by teleworking environments.  The SPITE approach, which is a SPICE extension model, is therefore developed as a major contribution to the software industry that fills an important gap in the software process modelling.  Good comments have been obtained from a small range of organisations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guo, Hong"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The earth used is typically a sandy clay or lateritic soil (red murram), stabilised with between 5-7% cement to improve the strength and durability of the blocks.  Only a small quantity of water is necessary to compact the material in the ram and to allow for the hydration of the cement.  The interlocks between the blocks reduce the need for 10mm mortar joints.  Testing with different soils, surface treatments, lime and cement stabilisers were conducted at Southampton Solent University, UK (Browne, 2005).  Ongoing tests at Makerere University in Uganda are researching the use of enzymes and polymers in providing innovative low carbon alternatives to cement. This paper introduces the use of this technology and assesses the different stabilising options to produce low carbon earth blocks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Browne, Gordon"],"dc:date":"2009-09-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In fact, multihulls have existed ever since man discovered he could prevent his log boat from tipping over by lashing several together to form a raft, which was not only stable but could also carry a larger load.  These rafts, rigged with sails, are also believed to have travelled downwind thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean by the first Peruvian settlers to the South Sea Islands. A constant evolution has occurred ever since from the Malanesians log-supported rafts to the Pacific Proa and today’s designs.\r\nUnfortunately, multihulls have become not so popular over the years as people got afraid of them because of their tendency of staying upside down when the unlikely situation of capsizing occurs. Also, in the racing world, disasters implying loss of lives have not contributed in making multihulls attractive. But a lot of efforts have been made from designers to make multihulls both safe and seaworthy and an evolution in people’s mind is already visible.\r\nHere, the idea was to design a cruising trimaran of a reasonable size to allow long distance cruising for people keen on speed and great sensations. The author always considered the performance as a priority in this design even though the boat had to be kept simple and suitable for family cruising. Many aspects of the design were studied and are fully described in their respective chapter together with possible improvements.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guilbaud, Xavier"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.259324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586689,"sim:weight":0.256657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154412,"sim:weight":0.253925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154321,"sim:weight":0.248384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97878,"sim:weight":0.247713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.244902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44678,"sim:weight":0.243171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890342,"sim:weight":0.240356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.238685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890315,"sim:weight":0.235268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108361,"sim:weight":0.233267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382859,"sim:weight":0.226355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.224675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43177,"sim:weight":0.220081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108601,"sim:weight":0.21772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48382,"sim:weight":0.215206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99217,"sim:weight":0.213998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45186,"sim:weight":0.210444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769042,"sim:weight":0.208006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764209,"sim:weight":0.206362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These had several forms such as the Club de France Rule and the Y.R.A. Rule in Britain.  Because these rules varied from club to club as well as from country to country, it was difficult to create fair competition.  Although the Club de France Rule was used in the first Olympic regatta it was not considered adequate. \r\nIn 1906 an effort was made to consolidate the various Rules and it was decided that the new Rule should produce seaworthy and desirable yachts with scantling design to conform to standards set down by the Lloyd’s Register. This was the beginning of the International Meter Rule, and the birth of the Six-, Eight- and Twelve-Meter Classes. (4)\r\nThe most popular of the Meter Classes is the Six having been an Olympic Class from 1908 until 1952. However since 1950’s the class has been in decline although it still has large fleet racing on the Mediterranean and the lakes of Europe.\r\nThe Meter Classes were the major development classes of the early part of the twentieth century with the first Genoa headsail appearing on a Six-Meter yacht racing at a regatta in Genoa. Because of their draft-limiting rule, most of the wing keel developments since Australia II (A Twelve Meter) have been in the Six-Meter class. Unlike other development classes the development has not come at the expense of the seaworthiness of the yachts and this is truly a credit to the architects of the Rule.","bibo:AuthorList":["McConnell, Rob"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44488,"sim:weight":0.317428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.292975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106463,"sim:weight":0.266223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106439,"sim:weight":0.264938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316125,"sim:weight":0.25114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.232506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664597,"sim:weight":0.23063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229919,"sim:weight":0.229813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45098,"sim:weight":0.229391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383480,"sim:weight":0.226411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316094,"sim:weight":0.224008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46835,"sim:weight":0.220629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60875,"sim:weight":0.218088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108857,"sim:weight":0.216068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43756,"sim:weight":0.214227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51463,"sim:weight":0.213666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.211391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382063,"sim:weight":0.210424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769042,"sim:weight":0.207968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383629,"sim:weight":0.206576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This present dissertation tries to cover all the subjects taught during the degree through a complete design loop. The design process started at an early stage by defining what are the limitations and requirements of such a vessel, followed by parametric studies of similar yachts. It was followed by the hull design, general arrangement and structural calculations, which were completed via the help of the American Bureau of Shipping rules for Classification of Offshore Racing Yachts. After a detailed weight estimate, the stability of the design was obtained by a hydrostatics package, determining the ability for the yacht to carry sails. The author presents in conclusion his time log spent on this dissertation, plus an evaluation of the further work that will be necessary to finalise this project.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bourgeois, Bertrand"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":106463,"sim:weight":0.358054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146140,"sim:weight":0.288948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.264274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.26419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101584,"sim:weight":0.232961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22948,"sim:weight":0.222793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664544,"sim:weight":0.213544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383501,"sim:weight":0.211813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.20941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.204397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.201256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.197093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108738,"sim:weight":0.189463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.18237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769042,"sim:weight":0.180443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664656,"sim:weight":0.179634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187738,"sim:weight":0.173988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.170423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24913,"sim:weight":0.16686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48424,"sim:weight":0.162132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The choice was then between a multihull and a monohull. The advantage of the students of Southampton Institute is that they can use some modern tools like the towing tank, or the wind tunnel. The choice of dissertation was then turned to experimentations and testing.\r\nLooking to the past dissertation, most of the designs have been done on monohull. Hence, a large quantity of information is available. The interest of doing some testing on multihulls was an evidence for the author.\r\nIn order to compare the results to existing boats, a choice has been done to use a class of boat that is regulated by rules. Consequently, the dissertation is about designing a formula 28 catamaran. This class is regulated by very precise rules.

Today, they are developed to the point of having exceptional performances in front of the monohull.\r\nAs the Formula 28’ is a racing multihull class, so the design must strictly respect the rules to be able to take part to the Champion-Ship.\r\nMost of the final design process areas are covered, always comparing with all kind of existing multihull to remember in which way the boat must be developed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Malotaux, Eric"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.378489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146140,"sim:weight":0.364184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.363159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.291555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.290743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929882,"sim:weight":0.289729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.278915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5091727,"sim:weight":0.277259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.27687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.276846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5091721,"sim:weight":0.276682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.274952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.273316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108870,"sim:weight":0.271052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352164,"sim:weight":0.261871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154412,"sim:weight":0.26077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101583,"sim:weight":0.260548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.25765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316357,"sim:weight":0.25328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205920,"sim:weight":0.247027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The second objective was to provide a smaller, less expensive alternative to the ever more costly open 60 trimarans,  for which the build cost has approximately doubled since 19971.  The reasoning behind this was that a less expensive class could be more attractive to sponsors as there would be less financial risk involved and secondly it would provide younger sailors with a stepping stone into the larger open 60’s.  Looking towards the open style mono-hulls it can be seen that there are moves towards this.  The open 60 mono-hulls are now commonly racing along side open 50’s and currently many designers have open 40 style yachts on their drawing boards.\r\nAt this stage while the size of yacht had been determined, the hull configuration was unknown, the two main types are of course the catamaran and trimaran although it was decided that a proa may provide an interesting alternative.  It was therefore necessary to examine the various qualities inherent in each configuration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mears, Steven"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.355732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106463,"sim:weight":0.309293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.262183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.233428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60875,"sim:weight":0.229034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.222438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84370,"sim:weight":0.219023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48414,"sim:weight":0.217505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193190,"sim:weight":0.216808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43662,"sim:weight":0.215257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.21262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.209639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.207694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108603,"sim:weight":0.200287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.200012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.198557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769042,"sim:weight":0.195777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44768,"sim:weight":0.19461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.191384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.191384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This project therefore outlines the factors that need to be altered on the boat for it to be compliant in accordance to the MCA. This project also outlines what is involved in creating a successful charter business. This includes, marketing tactics, product placement in the market and forms of advertising. \r\n\r\nThe boat was examined last year in accordance with the MCA ‘The safety of small commercial sailing vessels – a code of practice’ codebook. From this it was possible to establish what needs to be altered on the boat before it can receive its compliance. The marketing aspect of the project involved an in depth analysis of the charter market in order to find and exploit a niche.\r\n\r\nFrom the research that I did on the boat I found that it would be feasible to upgrade ‘Jenny May’ to a MCA compliant vessel. Cost analysis charts were drawn up to give an idea of the expenditure involved in the process. After much research into the charter market I found a couple of areas that would allow me to create a competitive charter business. The first idea is to operate a flexible charter between low cost airports and at the same time penetrating the market to produce a quality charter holiday at a low cost. This therefore increases the demand and awareness of the company. The second idea is to charter in accordance to major sporting events around the world; at present there are mainly only super yachts that do this. We will therefore offer the option to tailor affordable charter packages to suit the clients’ requirements. \r\n\r\nThis project therefore starts at the stage when the boat was purchased and covers all the aspects stated above to a financial forecast for the year 2005.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ellvers, Alexander"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.270223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.264627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.25859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.25859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.25859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.25859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.25859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.25859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.25859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.25859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.25859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.25859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.25859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.25859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.25859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.25859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84434,"sim:weight":0.250229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671209,"sim:weight":0.248784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.248514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84370,"sim:weight":0.247044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While there is plenty of evidence pointing to the conversion of merchant vessels from one use to another, this has been less obvious in the large yacht market.  Recently, the large yacht or “megayacht” industry has seen the completion of several retrospectively styled new builds as the desire for owners to express their individualism becomes paramount.  There are an increasing number of conversions of commercial vessels offering not only style, but space and a reassurance of quality build. These observations are discussed, focussing on the “Prince Albert” – a 1954 Yugoslavian cargo/ferry.\r\n\r\nThe vessel is subjected to survey, measurement and stability assessments. The regulatory bodies with rules pertaining to the “Prince Albert” are identified. The difficulties that may be encountered with compliance are discussed and solutions to the problems offered. As part of this process, a comparison of different materials is made, with particular emphasis being made of the substitution of steel for lightweight composites.\r\n\r\nThe problems associated with fire, fire exits and emergency escape routes are highlighted. The difficulties of acting in accordance with the internationally recognised Safety Of Life At Sea A60 fire test standards is also discussed with reference to both steel and composite materials.  Finally, an impression of the vessel with its modifications and an indication of the project management of such a conversion are presented.\r\n\r\nThe project finds that there is considerable work, which may not be immediately apparent, that needs to be undertaken to ensure success. The vessel appeared to show a flaw in its stability requirements that could mean failure to comply with classification authorities.  As the vessel has had considerable extra steel work added throughout its lifetime it is believed that this has contributed to this change. \r\n\r\nThe vessel represents the style that is sought after in the large yacht market and would therefore make the conversion an attractive proposition. The conversion could be successful providing meticulous planning and budgetary control are exercised.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gee, Roger"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.290562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.2857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.285536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.284144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.270942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.270942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.270942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.270942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.270942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.270942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.270942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.270942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.270942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.270942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.270942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.270942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.270942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.270942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.263422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103149,"sim:weight":0.263153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is also true of the yacht manufacturing industry.\r\n\r\nThere are many items within the law of both Europe and the US that all yacht manufacturers should take into consideration. And with the recent introduction of the European Directive 1999/44/EC on certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and guarantees there is know a more common way of dealing with this throughout Europe.  The laws that are applicable to the markets that the yacht manufacturers are selling need to be understood by all those that they affect, from both the manufacturers and dealers. \r\n\r\nThe cost of setting up and carrying out high levels of customer care for motor yacht owners can be large including flying engineers across the world at a moments notice in order to solve problems with the yachts. This all costs money and must be accounted for in the cost of a yacht. Efficient quality control procedures can help to reduce the need for such travel to rectify problems as well as improving the overall quality of the yachts therefore raising the satisfaction levels of the customers.\r\n\r\nThe gauging of how customers feel about the product and the service that they receive is vitally important as without this it is not easy to improve the systems and product in terms of what the customer actually requires and wants.   \r\n\r\nAbove all the customer must be kept satisfied and it is the after-sales department within a yacht manufacturer that must do this in order to keep customers and help attract new ones.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hall, James Kevin"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5067166,"sim:weight":0.386497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151310,"sim:weight":0.35449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664687,"sim:weight":0.354375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382004,"sim:weight":0.338997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5065560,"sim:weight":0.329228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85837,"sim:weight":0.32749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57144,"sim:weight":0.323394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58828,"sim:weight":0.32288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5066014,"sim:weight":0.316204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5065605,"sim:weight":0.306869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46163,"sim:weight":0.302302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":698942,"sim:weight":0.300107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45808,"sim:weight":0.298568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101453,"sim:weight":0.291064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5065781,"sim:weight":0.28741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.283751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671209,"sim:weight":0.279175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48237,"sim:weight":0.277102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090938,"sim:weight":0.272595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383492,"sim:weight":0.263589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Initially the history of accidents at sea, specifically looking into the 1979 Fastnet and 1998 Sydney-Hobart races, previous accounts from sailors who have lost vessels and been stranded at sea and accident statistics. \r\n\r\nIt then investigates what is currently on offer in the way of survival equipment in the marine industry and considers these against safety equipment in comparable industries.\r\n\r\nAfter concluding that current systems, especially liferafts, have a large number of publicised shortcomings, a new design/ concept was conceived. The design utilises current liferaft technology and using a design employed in the aeronautical industry as its basis, incorporates an inflatable collar into the hull of the vessel. This design addresses all of the identified drawbacks and provides great improvements to vessel stability, crew safety and recovery.\r\n\r\nTo test the design all the data was entered into stability calculations. The results from this proved better than expected.\r\n\r\nA 1/8th scale model was created using a Whitbread 60 hull. This model was subjected to an inclining experiment, the results of which were compared to the theoretical results for the same model to test the accuracy of the calculations. The results from both methods were very close. This proved that the theoretical method can be used to accurately predict increases in stability. In both cases the experiment was deemed a complete success.\r\n\r\nThe latter section of the report suggests ways in which the design can be incorporated into the hull to offer maximum results, whilst requiring as little effort from the crew as possible. It then investigates how to further develop the project and lists potential issues associated with a development program. \r\n\r\nThese are overcome by the recommendation of introducing the design to a company who already has experience at producing marine safety systems. It also gives recommendations to the marine industry as to how best to improve the regulations for marine safety equipment so that a universal standard can be rapidly adopted.","bibo:AuthorList":["Holloway, Gareth James"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99320,"sim:weight":0.372214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103149,"sim:weight":0.368848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3170,"sim:weight":0.351521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98523,"sim:weight":0.351221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2707995,"sim:weight":0.347109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.337221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.337221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.337221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.337221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.337221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.337221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.337221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.337221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.337221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.337221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.337221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.337221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.337221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.337221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.335394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It begins with a discriminating synthesis of the relevant literature from the disciplines of Art History, Sociology, Anthropology, Economics and Psychology.  Financial value is strongly correlated with aesthetic value, which is created partially through the process of exchange itself, but largely through the ascribing of \u0027meaning\u0027 to objects through social and historical mechanisms.  These mechanisms are examined using consumer behaviour paradigms.  The economic notion of \u0027artistic capital stock\u0027 is assessed for its wider applicability.\r\n\r\nThe study focuses on the creation of perceptions of cultural and financial worth, and valuation of antique Chinese ceramics, which through their inter-cultural complexity, are seen as illuminating a breadth of generalisable phenomena.  The creation of perceptions is viewed on both the level of encircling cultural predispositions, and on a level of more specific interactions between the consumer and what are viewed as marketing inputs.\r\n\r\nThe methodology adopted is one of cross-reference between qualitatively described observations derived from particiopation in the market, and quantitative behavioural analysis of a database compiled from the auction sales of Sotheby\u0027s and Christie\u0027s over a five year period.\r\n\r\nThe results indicate that consumers of \u0027art\u0027 are behaviourally similar to generic consumers of any goods.  Further they are risk-reducing seekers of autonomy through affiliation, which appears to compete in the fulfilment of their higher order psychological needs.  Culturally established mechanisms for the ascription of \u0027meaning\u0027 to \u0027art\u0027 objects are shown to correlate functionality with the creation of brand perceptions through the marketing of fast moving consumer goods.\r\n\r\nThe specific inputs which contribute to the perception of value, are identified and modelled.  Recommendations are made regarding a fuller examination of the \u0027valuation\u0027 process and the appropirateness of further examinations of the \u0027art market\u0027 by consumer behaviourists.","bibo:AuthorList":["Foster, Timothy Charles"],"dc:date":"1997","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664707,"sim:weight":0.3384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24651,"sim:weight":0.320324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.284026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108980,"sim:weight":0.280979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187687,"sim:weight":0.274393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58899,"sim:weight":0.269722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56605,"sim:weight":0.265508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.264202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.259937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.259937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.259937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.259937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.259937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.259937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.259937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.259937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.259937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.259937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.259937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.259937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":6200842,"ep:Repository":104,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"How do micro enterprises want to learn?","bibo:abstract":"Objectives To examine the learning needs of Micro Enterprises and to critically evaluate whether educators can deliver marketing skills to Micro Enterprises to meet their needs. Prior Work Writers suggest that the marketing behaviour of small firms appears to be related to the motivation, belief, attitude and the objectives of the owner-manager and that when small businesses are formed, they are often based on a particular skill of the founder and that there are a number of barriers to learning. Academic research appears unable to resolve a number of questions about small businesses and their use of marketing and that further research is needed. Approach Micro Enterprises are relatively easier to identify and make contact with relevant individuals compared with larger organisations. The geographic area of Hampshire, United Kingdom, has been chosen because of its accessibility, segmentation will be by type, e.g. Sole traders, Partnerships and Limited Companies. Both empirical quantitative and qualitative research paradigms will be engaged and the results compared with studies undertaken in 2005 by Simpson, Padmore and Taylor. Method(s) A qualitative naturalistic approach is being used to explore the views, behaviour and experiences within Micro Enterprises compared to the quantitative data will give a more general and scientific overview. Techniques like qualitative interviews and quantitative questionnaires will be adopted as they are considered to be more appropriate in the field of social science research and in particular for this study. Results Potential outcomes: that the external and internal influences on a Micro Enterprises do/do not impact on an individuals learning decision, that Micro Enterprises do/do not really know what marketing is and do/do not engage in learning, that firms are not well understood by educators or that they are understood but fail to deliver appropriate skill training due to other constraints and that educators need to make a paradigm shift in their methods of delivery to Micro Enterprises. Implications The findings will establish how Micro Enterprises acquire and learn the skills to market their business and evaluate the needs and wants of Micro Enterprises and how they want to engage in learning new skills versus current delivery systems which are not customer led. Finally, after a critical analysis of whether educators can deliver marketing skills to Micro Enterprises to meet the needs and wants of this sector more effectively a new model will be developed to reflect the research results. Value The core value of this paper is to put forward a new model for discussion of how these firms could have marketing skills delivered to them in a way which matches their needs and wants. The research will then lead us into a deeper understanding of Micro Enterprises and the development of alternative ways of delivering marketing skills to them. Approaches to training will have to change if educators want to engage with this sector.","bibo:AuthorList":["Strachan, Lesley"],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383492,"sim:weight":0.360914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108823,"sim:weight":0.360251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.344747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.334353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58839,"sim:weight":0.327477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158997,"sim:weight":0.320174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.319394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.31325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48356,"sim:weight":0.311277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383355,"sim:weight":0.307814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.305769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.304729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.304729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.304729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.304729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.304729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.304729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.304729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.304729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.304729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Supporting this theory is a research study by the Learning and Skills Development Agency, which showed that employers and employees learn best from their everyday experiences, and place great value on informal learning rather than on taught courses or structured training programmes, (Anon, 2004). \r\n\r\nProject – based courses are favoured for the development of skills (Mc Mullan et al., 1991), which has been used with some success at the University of Alberta with some success (Preshing, 1991). Increasingly, educators are using experiential learning (Smart et al., 1999) which ties in with what employers want.

This has been run as one designs as well as under all manor of handicap systems. Although handicap systems have come and gone, the range of yachts using them has changed little. Boats that race offshore are required to carry an inventory of safety equipment that, should they be needed, will help the crew get through any unexpected circumstances. However, this inventory adds up to a substantial weight. Not only is this weight not accounted for when a boat is weighed for her rating, but this weight varies considerably across a range of boat sizes. This is to be expected except that the weight varies approximately to crew numbers rather than displacement. This now sets up a problem as displacement varies cubically with length where as crew numbers vary almost linearly with length. \r\n\tThe aim of this investigation is to determine to what extent small boats are disadvantaged, if at all. This was carried out by comparing parametric data of geometrically similar boats of different sizes with the weight of safety equipment they would be expected to carry for each ORC special regulations category. A nominal crew number was be set for each boat.\r\nData was collected afloat by sailing a Dehler 34 around a triangular course with differing displacements. This was done six times, one for each ORC category and a lightship state. Data was collected by linking the boat’s instruments with a laptop computer. This data was then compared with the boat speed predictions made by a VPP and the change in TCF of the IRM formula. All three analytical techniques could then be compared with the additional weight the smaller boats carry over the larger boats. Weights and speed drops were all expressed as percentages for comparison. \r\n\r\nThe six metre boat was found to be carrying five and a half times more safety equipment than the Maxi as a percentage of displacement. The data collected afloat suggested that a Dehler 34 was eight percent slower when loaded with ORC category 0 safety equipment. The VPP pointed to one percent slower and the IRM formula was only 0.1 percent slower when in the same loaded condition. \r\n\r\n\tThere is clearly a case that the range of weight that the safety equipment covers does have a significant effect on boat speed, but due to there being so many uncontrollable variables, a fuller investigation involving a greater range of boats and meteorological conditions needs to be carried out. This will enable more accurate figures to be put on these effects. The VPP cannot cope with some features of this investigation fully and so more time afloat is justified. More data would reinforce the case to issue a different TCF for each ORC category but of course crew numbers would then have to be enforced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kaczor, Scott"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.263342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.254015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.237367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.236314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60875,"sim:weight":0.232141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.229104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84370,"sim:weight":0.227674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316357,"sim:weight":0.225361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185983,"sim:weight":0.224264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.220932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8763966,"sim:weight":0.219241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1656477,"sim:weight":0.217758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.214821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.210085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.210085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.210085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.210085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.210085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.210085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.210085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The marine industry is constantly changing and developing with current legislations and implications on styrene emissions becoming stricter with time.\r\n\r\nThe main material used in the construction of vessels is Fibre Reinforced Plastics (FRP) combined with a resin. Within many of the resins used in the industry is a chemical called styrene. Styrene is used as a cross linking agent, linking the polymers together, and also lowers the viscosity of the polyester polymer, to provide a workable product. \r\n\r\nThe occupational exposure limits for styrene are shown by Time Work Average (TWA) based on an eight-hour reference period and by Short term maximum Exposure Level (STEL) based on a fifteen-minute reference period. In the UK, the (TWA) is set to one hundred ppm, and the (STEL) is set to two hundred and fifty ppm.\r\n\r\nThe UK has one of the highest allowable concentrations of styrene compared to other countries. There is a voluntary continuous exposure limit of fifty ppm, set out by the workers, which applies at all times within the workplace.\r\n\r\nThis project examines the different materials and techniques used within the marine industry detailing the advantages and disadvantages of each. It also examines the relevant legislations and implications that are related to this type of manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe companies involved with using FRP are aware of the possible issues related with styrene and make a conscious effort to monitor and reduce their emissions. The atmospheric monitoring is carried out by use of absorbent tubes, passive devices and detector tubes. Low styrene resins and resin suppressants are used as a method of emission reduction along with the closed moulding technique. The closed moulding technique is used to either extract or contain the emissions to keep them away from the workers, as well as being able to provide a high quality laminate.\r\n\r\nThere have been many risk assessments carried out on the effect of styrene, which indicate that styrene is not as harmful as originally thought.\r\n\r\nIf new legislations were brought in, evolution will take place. Many of the smaller companies will be forced to cease trading due to being unable to cope, although larger companies will still continue to develop their materials and techniques. These companies will survive until the next legislations and implications come into force when the companies will be forced to either improve again or back down and cease trading.

The results of the initial investigations are used to inform the design of a temporary oven \u0026 build enclosure which is then tested by the use of specially written spreadsheets for cost and energy modelling.\r\n\r\nTest results cover various sizes of boats from twenty to fifty feet (6 to 15 metres) at curing temperatures of 50 and 80 C based on data from a leading resin supplier in the industry and the stated alternative times for ramp-up and curing periods.\r\n\r\nThe main conclusions (related to the manufacture of boats in the above range) are that in the short term it is cheaper to use additional energy for post-curing than to construct a more efficient build enclosure / oven where costs are being passed on to the customer and that it is difficult to combine an access structure for working on the mould with the enclosing structure of the temporary oven.\r\n\r\nBased on the spreadsheets developed by the author, graphs are provided as a ‘rule of thumb’ guide to power consumption and total costs for post-curing boats of various lengths.\r\n\r\nA detailed analysis of the spreadsheet results concludes that the key pointer is to find a practical way of fixing the insulation on the inside of a temporary structure in order to minimise the total mass to be heated.\r\n\r\nThe report touches on the short-term nature of individual project-based yacht manufacturing and observes that it is difficult to justify long-term investment in more efficient production spaces for post-curing until tax-efficient incentives, such as capital allowances for plant \u0026 machinery can be applied to the use of temporary ovens.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, the report identifies the potential for further work on the development of a standard kit of parts for energy-efficient oven construction which could be erected and dismantled as required at minimum labour cost within a lightweight build enclosure.  The incentive for this investment could be a radical shift in the real cost of energy – and a sea change in attitudes towards energy use and generation – over the next decade.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the boatbuilding industry appears to be on a plateau of efficiency for one-off post-cured products, based on the individual efforts of yacht manufacturers to deliver a quality product to their customers at a reasonable cost.","bibo:AuthorList":["Whatley, Alex"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.319296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661925,"sim:weight":0.313475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.304268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.304268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.304268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.304268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.304268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.304268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.304268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.304268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.304268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.304268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.304268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.304268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.304268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.304268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.29642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.294945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.282382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24911,"sim:weight":0.279167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Comfort and performance are the key words for this design. The parametric study represents the starting point to determine a design guideline and fix the main parameters. Adjustment have been done on these parametrics in order to obtain the desired shape. Performance has been achieved correcting the hull shape according to stability problem. A limit on the heeling angle of around 20 degree has been fixed in order to feel comfortable during sailing. A Dellenbaugh angle has been worked out and then a WinPP check has been used to understand the speed performance of the yacht. Comfort has been provided analysing form and function for all the items involved in the yacht in order to use the volume in an ergonomic way. The owner may want to show most of the minor harbour to his friends or just don’t have the limit of maximum draft. To supply at this demand a lifting keel has been fitted. The keel represent only one of the automated device which have been introduced in this yacht. The author idea is to produce a boat which can offer the possibility, even for less experienced people, to enjoy sailing. The answer to solution for this requirement is to have most of the device, which require human precision and strength, automated. Electric winches, self furling main and jib, hydraulic tender door and bimini have been provided to offer maximum comfort and simplicity. From the structure point of view, the size of the yacht imply to follow regulation for large vessel and in this case Lloyd’s Rules and Regulation for classification of special service craft (3) have been chose.

The new course and the demands it will put to the boats due to different weather conditions on the new course have triggered the motivation to design a preliminary 2nd generation VO70 to the new rule and optimized to the new course, based on a successful design from the 2005/06 race.\r\nThe latest version of the race course will lead the boats into regions with different winds and different wind directions in the Indian Ocean, South-East Asia as well as\r\nChina. To find an estimate for the weather conditions that can be expected a weather study was carried out. Initial sets of hull lines were drawn, with the lines of the above\r\nmentioned parent model and an initial comparison of parametric data of 5 different hull shapes to the parent hull has been carried out. A statistical parametric comparison with other Volvo70s was at the stage when the project was started not possible as public data was not available due to the just recently finished race.\r\nTwo preliminary hull shapes, one with the maximum Rule beam of 5.7m and one with the medium beam of 5.4m were selected to compete against each other in an artificial course sections within the VPP, based on the weather study and the course.\r\nThe outcome of these races was evaluated with respect to the scoring system within the race and the winning hull has been chosen to develop further.\r\nA towing tank experiment to verify the data from the VPP has been discarded in favour of a more detailed design in areas such as appendages design, deck/safetyissues\r\nand the structure of the yacht.\r\nA weight study has been carried out with respect to what information is available and been updated with calculated data to optimize the bulb weight. Also attention has been paid to the shifting of equipment under and on deck (“stacking”) and its affects to the stability of the yacht which has been worked out with positions of each item under certain sailing conditions. This data then has been\r\nput back into the stability and weight calculations.\r\nThe deck layout representing the workbench for the sailors for every day in all conditions has been developed under consideration of what sailors form the last race\r\nliked and did not like, for example height of coach roof to protect the crew from water washing over the deck.\r\nFurther on the Rule requirements were addressed. Structure, stability, powering, safety, accommodation and sail are strongly driven by the VO70 Rule. Changes to version 1 of the Rule were especially addressed and worked out to optimize the boat under the new requirements.\r\nThe author was involved in the construction process of Pirates of the Caribbean in summer 2005.

The idea of making your own boat is a desire had by many likeminded people who both enjoy the water and are enthusiastic about DIY.\r\nUsing the relevant materials and techniques is it not possible to design a 21st century vessel that can be supplied as a kit for the DIY enthusiast to fabricate in their garden, garage or anywhere possible in their own time?\r\nUsing the materials and pre-cut frames, core material and simple build manual provided in the pack to do so.","bibo:AuthorList":["Murphy, Paul John"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":103766,"sim:weight":0.427159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106439,"sim:weight":0.263406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.252255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.250544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.24979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.24816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.24816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.24816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.24816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.24816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.24816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.24816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.24816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187457,"sim:weight":0.2448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105058,"sim:weight":0.243361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.240638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48272,"sim:weight":0.235876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106765,"sim:weight":0.229037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.228503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6205920,"sim:weight":0.228087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Its’ ice covered wastes have only in the past century been explored by man, in some cases with great loss of life. The exploits of the early pioneers, such as Shackleton and Scott, have become modern legends. Antarctica is a rich continent, containing vast quantities of hugely valuable mineral resources. Because of this, countries have fought over ownership, and six countries currently lay claim to it. Following the demise of commercial Antarctic whaling in the thirties, the Earths largest landmass has been largely unoccupied. There are still vast unexplored areas of the coastline, providing thrilling, if arduous, cruising for the growing number of yachts which venture down. Inland, there are unclimbed mountain ranges, and terrain never before trodden. The scenery is awe inspiring, and the wildlife teeming. There is still much to be learned from the continent, and through this knowledge may come the ability to manage, protect, and conserve its near pristine state. The opportunity to create a design that might facilitate such exploration was too good to pass up. This study stems from a personal interest in Antarctic cruising; the result of a four month expedition with the British Army in 2001 – 2002. It is hoped that this experience might provide some insight into avenues hitherto unexplored. Whether it is the beautiful scenery, the prolific wildlife, the possibility of a first ascent or simply heading South to find oneself, this hostile, ‘aweful’, place will always exert a magnetic attraction for some. It is for these people that I have produced this project.","bibo:AuthorList":["Holman, Simon Keith"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2863,"sim:weight":0.325246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60875,"sim:weight":0.269322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97878,"sim:weight":0.249689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108656,"sim:weight":0.236187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.233295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18090,"sim:weight":0.23215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187457,"sim:weight":0.227072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.22504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48408,"sim:weight":0.223815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9019543,"sim:weight":0.217577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9030165,"sim:weight":0.217551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43177,"sim:weight":0.214751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.214726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108685,"sim:weight":0.211145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387394,"sim:weight":0.206574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.206141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709917,"sim:weight":0.206133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.204693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108757,"sim:weight":0.200814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108601,"sim:weight":0.199088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":6200890,"ep:Repository":104,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Social value associated with marine and coastal protected area designations in England and Wales","bibo:abstract":"There is a current environment of change and progress within marine protection, reflected internationally by examples such as the Convention of Biological Diversity\r\nand nationally by the Marine and Coastal Access Act, 2009. Despite the UK\u0027s government agenda in this area, and the draw of people to coastal areas generally, the larger UK public lacks understanding and awareness regarding the marine environment. Combined with these circumstances, the social value of Marine and Coastal Protected Areas (MCPAs) has been largely ignored relative to conservation and economics drivers, with the latter invariably taking precedence in environmental policy making. There is also a need for an appropriate framework or methodology with which to address the above in light of communicating, particularly the nontangible, social values of MCPAs to decision makers.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates the social value of MCPAs in England and Wales through three data collection phases. These include a series of interviews to gain a perspective of social value from MCPA practitioners and the public. The emerging results are then examined in light of their operational value through in-depth case studies. The results led to the development of two assessment tools of social value which can accommodate both tangible and intangible values. The tools included a normative statement of examples demonstrating optimum social value, and a social\r\nvalue zoning tool that allows practitioners to \u0027map\u0027 the social value of their MCPA for evaluative purposes. The final research findings are represented by a conceptual\r\nmodel of social value within MCPAs. The assessment tools and model assist with the clarification of social value within MCPAs and can be used by decision makers to assess and communicate the social value of their site and influence management practice. This work demonstrates social value of MCPAs from several view pointsand develops tools which can be used by MCPA decision makers to evaluate, and further develop social value within these areas.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pike, Kathrine Louise"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Agardy.

The research demonstrates that there appears to be an ongoing power struggle between the executive, legislative and judiciary. The extent of judicial discretion is regulated by mix of sentencing guidance sources which have varied in dominance over time. To inform the thesis a comparative study was carried out. The study specifically compares judicial discretion approaches in theft sentencing at the custody threshold in England and Denmark respectively in 2008 and 2009. The research critically analyses and compares how society influences the sentencing approach of English and Danish judges and how judges influence society. Historical critical discussion of both jurisdictions‟ recent development of judicial discretion is used to introduce the main research topics. Then a critical comparison of the conclusions of socio-legal research into sentencing refines what questions the qualitative interview guide should pose. Qualitative interviews of 12 District Court judges in 6 rural and urban areas within Denmark and 12 Magistrates in 6 rural and urban areas within England were conducted. The outcomes of this comparative study supported three conclusions. Firstly, that long term reform of theft offenders is the judicial priority. This is best achieved through mixed community punishments and enhanced rehabilitation focus during and after custody. Secondly, working relationship cohesion in England could benefit from adopting the Danish sentencing panel approach. This would entail mixed sentencing panels of one professional judge accompanied by two lay judges. Thirdly, the collective training of English judges in case law comparison skills and legislative interpretation is an important tool in encouraging judicial faith and confidence. This will lead to a more pro-active and cohesive Lower Court Judiciary and re-connect them with their more senior judicial peers in the Higher Courts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lowenstein, Max DP"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9017582,"sim:weight":0.568393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734378,"sim:weight":0.259543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187686,"sim:weight":0.239798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381927,"sim:weight":0.234335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382077,"sim:weight":0.231341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4161344,"sim:weight":0.222707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47022,"sim:weight":0.204048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9037722,"sim:weight":0.20182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160821,"sim:weight":0.200982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85815,"sim:weight":0.198772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387378,"sim:weight":0.195392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768753,"sim:weight":0.176572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85570,"sim:weight":0.176282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45050,"sim:weight":0.175684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387386,"sim:weight":0.171709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10019,"sim:weight":0.169334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2906,"sim:weight":0.164969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381982,"sim:weight":0.164114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9026852,"sim:weight":0.159475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44511,"sim:weight":0.155819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

From those early days boat building materials have also been evolving, from the initial use of wood, leather and plants it has moved through iron and steel and arrived at the present day where Fibre Reinforced Plastic (FRP) is the primary boat building material used throughout the world for recreational craft manufacture. Since the initial use of FRP in the early 1950’s there has been a pursuit of lighter, stronger and cheaper materials, technology has enabled us to combine a number of chemical elements to produce these advanced composite materials; however during this pursuit there has never been any understanding of the effect this development has been having on the environment around us. Man has been developing and producing these products to enjoy and interact with his local environment however in producing these products he has also been changing the local environment in a number of negative ways, reducing air and water quality, contaminating soil and ground water and producing mountains of un-recyclable waste.\r\nIn the past 10 years environmental concerns have risen to the forefront of public consciousness, society has recognised these environmental problems and governments around the world have started introducing legislation in an attempt to curb the negative impacts on the environment and the health of the populous.\r\nThe boat building industry must keep up with these fast moving developments and evolve or face being pushed out of the market due to the high costs of complying with these regulations or losing the favour of the environmentally conscious purchaser.\r\nThis Study will evaluate a specific motor yacht (Fairline Phantom 40) in terms of its environmental costs, the costs will then be compared against a number of current and developing substitute materials and methods and any changes which would be beneficial to both the environment and the builder will be recommended.\r\nThe conclusions show no financial or technical reasons for not using natural fibre reinforced plastic in certain internal laminates, possible process changes to reduce emissions and motoryacht recycling options.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wombwell, Ross Alexander"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664632,"sim:weight":0.379222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5078829,"sim:weight":0.367235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84647,"sim:weight":0.357745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.339466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.338232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.321771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.32052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.32052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.32052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.32052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.32052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.32052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.32052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.32052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.32052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.32052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.32052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.32052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.32052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.32052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The vessel’s performance criteria was to achieve a maximum speed of 60 knots and to be competitive with leading name brands such as, Sunseeker International, Princess Yachts International, Fairline Boats Plc, Ferretti Yachts and Pershing Yachts, in terms of retail price, but differ in exterior styling from the normal characteristic of a white hull and super structure. To achieve this while remaining at a similar retail price to the above mentioned, a study was conducted into the financial viability and benefits of producing the vessel in South Africa where the labour costs were found to be 89% less than that of the UK and an overall production cost being 8.4% less than the UK, with a profit margin of at least 45%. The sheer line of the vessel is varying and sloping down towards the bow to achieve an aggressive fast look. The super structure is made up of glass and aluminium which is radically different to the above mentioned vessels and gives the vessel a stealth look. Finally, the speed criteria was achieved by using the DNV High Speed and Light Craft Rule, to achieve a modest structural weight and installing twin MTU 1920kW (2575 Hp) engines, coupled with Arneson Surface Drives.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cairns, Lawson"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":106463,"sim:weight":0.265317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45534,"sim:weight":0.219418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.218763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99169,"sim:weight":0.203677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.199794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27905,"sim:weight":0.199293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381902,"sim:weight":0.196734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.196591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.196591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.196591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.196591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.196591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.196591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.196591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.196591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.196591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.196591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.196591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.196591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.196591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Today, with the increase in motor traffic through the two Mersey Tunnels, passenger numbers have dropped to unprofitable levels. During off peak hours, tourist pleasure cruises have replaced the commuter services, but the vessel’s mostly open deck areas do not provide the ideal protection from the North West of England climate.\r\nThe Design Brief objectives in general, were to replace the current ferries with more cost efficient vessels and to expand the capabilities of the fleet. It was anticipated that a more fuel efficient design was possible and the ability to operate in potentially rough conditions was necessary. The focus of a new design would also be on creating a vessel that could provide greater chartering facilities and create wider opportunities for generating business.\r\nThe SWATH (Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull) concept was adopted at an early stage as it appeared to be capable of providing a stable and comfortable ferry, suitable for the prevailing sea conditions.\r\nA hull form was created and analysed with the aid of three different resistance prediction methods. From this, a powering and propulsion system was selected, with detailed research into the unique propulsive efficiency qualities of a SWATH. This arrangement was predicted to offer a propulsion engine fuel saving of 55.8% per boat per year which at current fuel prices (06/05/10) equates to a £94,402 saving over the current ferries.\r\nThe vessel was predicted to be capable of reaching a top speed of 13 knots, which is a 1 knot increase over the current ferries.\r\nSeveral design pressure prediction methods were investigated but Lloyd’s Register Special Service Craft Rules, SSC, were used for the structural design. A steel hull and aluminium superstructure was selected for the combination of weight saving, reasonable cost and service robustness.\r\nThe ferry was designed having 2 large passenger decks which were weather tight and an open top deck. The weather tight deck areas offered improved facilities for chartering and would allow larger numbers of passengers to be catered for. The open spaces were designed to be flexible with no fixed furniture and as open plan as possible. The Mersey SWATH design offered 74% more capacity in all configurations over the current vessels and would also be capable of extending the services into seated dining cruises.\r\nBy expanding the money making capacity and doing so with reduced fuel costs must be seen as a successful outcome for the project. There are many areas of study that have been neglected due to time constraints and would need attention if resources permitted. However, it is hoped that this report covers the initial conception of a future Mersey ferry.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jupp, Matthew Simon"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316475,"sim:weight":0.405939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.275002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.266659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27905,"sim:weight":0.266427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.262923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.261876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84370,"sim:weight":0.260171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3169,"sim:weight":0.256702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769042,"sim:weight":0.254976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271236,"sim:weight":0.250598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.247228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.247228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.247228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.247228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.247228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.247228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.247228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.247228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.247228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.247228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":6200905,"ep:Repository":104,"dc:type":["Final Year Project","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Design optimisation of an IOR Mini Tonner for short handed IRC racing.","bibo:abstract":"In 2009 I was approached by the owner of the 7m yacht Eskymo, a Smokey 25, to produce recommendations for the modernisation and optimisation of the yacht which he had purchased earlier in the year with the aim of taking part in handicap racing on the Solent and other South Coast venues.\r\nThe yacht was designed and built in 1981 to be competitive under the IOR rating rule and at the time of purchase had not been modified or updated. Eskymo exhibited many of the characteristics of boats designed to that rule such as a rig with 150% genoa supported by running backstays and low form stability as this was penalised under the rule.\r\nAt the time of the brief the owner had already undertaken a number of modifications to the rig and chainplates and was proposing to add additional weight to the keel when he became aware of the MAIB report into the loss of Hooligan V which highlighted the potentially fatal consequences of such modifications.\r\nThe initial review took the form of a thorough survey of the boat and the production of a digital representation of the lines plan from which stability and performance predictions could be produced. The structure of the boat and key components were analysed to check that they met current best practise and where necessary recommendations were made to bring the boat in its current configuration up to standard.\r\nHaving a thorough understanding of the existing configuration an investigation was undertaken to look at the consequences to the structure and performance of adding a small stability bulb to the keel as originally proposed by the owner. This included a structural analysis of the Keel Bolts and Keel Floors and the effect on the chainplates and rig due to the resulting increase in loads.\r\nWhen the results for the stability and VPP were compared it became clear that the addition of the bulb had only a limited effect on stability as crew weight remained major factor and that the increase in drag associated with the bulb actually slowed the boat in light wind conditions. Reinstating the overlapping genoa may have helped offset this problem as the boat is underpowered in sub 10 knots but this did not meet the design brief for simplified boat handling.\r\nHaving analysed the stability and VPP data from the small bulb exercise it was decided to investigate the effect of a more radical modifications by replacing the rig with a light weight carbon fibre spar and transferring the additional weight saved into the bulb of a new fabricated keel. Once again the structures of the boat were reviewed in light of the increased loads resulting from the increase in power and righting moment. Stability \u0026 VPP data was produced for this new configuration.\r\nThe results from the VPP were then used to compare the performance of each mode around a two mile windward leeward course. While the new keel/big bulb proved to be faster above 10k of wind it was once again slower in light conditions. While meeting the objective of making the boat more user friendly in two handed mode when TCC’s from test IRC certificates were applied to the results the original boat won in most conditions on corrected time.\r\nIn conclusion I have recommended to the owner that he should not proceed with any further expensive modifications to try and gain rating advantage but concentrate on the structure of the existing configuration and spend his budget on areas of proven performance gains such as new sails.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cowell, Peter D."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.391036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154412,"sim:weight":0.294816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.285952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.282301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383475,"sim:weight":0.273826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382040,"sim:weight":0.272594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108139,"sim:weight":0.269566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664656,"sim:weight":0.267343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.264596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.256399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.255054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.255054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.255054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.255054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.255054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.255054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.255054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.255054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.255054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.255054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Wolfson Power Program is utilised as a tool to gain a greater understanding of the hull resistance and to check the quoted range against the fuel capacity of similar designs to ensure the size of the yacht will be capable of holding the required fuel for the specified range.\r\nA displacement hull is formed in Maxsurf and a bulbous bow is incorporated as the initial weight estimate leads to a significant discrepancy between the LCB and LCG. The hull resistance is analysed in some depth, with wind and wave resistance and a reduction factor for changes in load condition, so that an Atlantic model can be formed and used to estimate the required fuel.\r\nThe yacht features a twin shaft-line with robust heavy duty engines. A single engine installation is found to offer no increase in propulsion efficiency and is not practical in terms of the general arrangement.\r\nA steel transversely framed structural design is performed using the Lloyds Rules SSC software. A detailed weight estimate is carried to establish the position of VCG and LCG so that the stability can be analysed using Hydromax. The design is found to meet the RCD stability requirements. The sea keeping motions are briefly assessed and it may be the case that the roll period needs to be altered to give a more comfortable ride in rough sea conditions.\r\nOverall although further work is required there is no major reason to prevent the design being continued through to construction and the final yacht, the ‘Atlantic 65’, should meet the clients demands as set out in the design brief.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edwards, Barnaby"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This resulted in the majority of high-speed ferries, previously manufactured in composite, being built in aluminium to meet stringent regulations \u0026 fire codes. A trade-off in regulations was created whereby heavier high-speed vessels were being produced, increasing operating costs \u0026 reducing profit. However, combustible lightweight materials were deemed permissible through the new SOLAS II-2 (part F 2002) Regulation 17, providing that the equivalent safety level is demonstrated. This re-initiated the use of large-scale composite materials on passenger ferries permitting new high-volume application area for long-fibre composite materials. Rapid advances in technology has now made it possible to fabricate large ships completely of composite materials \u0026 the high specific strength of GRP, together with the superior specific stiffness offered by carbon \u0026 other high-modulus fibres, have led to a dramatic growth in the use of these materials.\r\nThrough the detailed structural analysis of a recent 40m aluminium catamaran fast-ferry construction the study’s objective is to: determine the best combination of material \u0026 construction process in order to design a composite fast-ferry that meets regulations \u0026 is competitive with aluminium construction in terms of weight \u0026 price.","bibo:AuthorList":["McHale, Robert Edward"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26461,"sim:weight":0.350454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5082222,"sim:weight":0.297521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45218,"sim:weight":0.278024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.269331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316475,"sim:weight":0.264467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98610,"sim:weight":0.236329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271236,"sim:weight":0.23182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27905,"sim:weight":0.231191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.222695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18164,"sim:weight":0.218125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27867,"sim:weight":0.213442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25818,"sim:weight":0.206575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24920,"sim:weight":0.205326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.202863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.202863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.202863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.202863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.202863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.202863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.202863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is typically private and ignores the benefits of collaboration. Our project extends innovative reflective techniques to students collaborating at two universities. At Southampton Solent University (SSU), reflective practice is focused on learning, structured in an adaptable spreadsheet via the virtual learning environment (VLE). At Bournemouth University (BU), the VLE Discussion Board facilitates asynchronous online discussion; during which students are encouraged to reflect.  This paper describes a project designed to enable users to learn from others\u0027 as well as their own reflections.  Participants completed a 52-item Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI) and a semi-structured questionnaire on their reflective practice, before being randomly assigned to groups comprising students from a single university or both universities. Via the VLE, participants watched a 20-minute video and then engaged in critical discussion of the content, prompted by four discussion points over a 2-week period. Simultaneously, they recorded reflections on an individual online reflection sheet at least once every other day. At the end of this period, participants were asked to share and discuss their online reflections for a further week. Finally, the MAI and the reflection questionnaire were re-administered. The data are currently being analysed using both quantitative methods (frequency and quantity of posts, changes in scores) and qualitative methods (depth of critical discussion). The results will have both practical and research-focussed outputs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mair, Carolyn","Taylor, Jaqui"],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1593488,"sim:weight":0.474048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104855,"sim:weight":0.406813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.355292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.341744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.33014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55042,"sim:weight":0.32996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.326906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193234,"sim:weight":0.325835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.321777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.321085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104691,"sim:weight":0.315694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.312708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.307507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385743,"sim:weight":0.305562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.29308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85720,"sim:weight":0.291591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1153659,"sim:weight":0.279675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768844,"sim:weight":0.267644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.255207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193190,"sim:weight":0.253238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Beside this achieved details, this craft has been designed to be used as a chartered day boat or particular owners in the Mediterranean Sea.\r\nThe current trend is to produce a large interior and exterior into an efficient hull form. A twin engines installation is required to push the boat to a high planning top speed desired by the customer. Even when cruising, the boat will not often operate at the top speed because of the cost and the limited range.\r\nThe idea is that the hull can cruise normally at a speed of 30 to 40 knots on a large distance.\r\nThe boat will be designed to be comfortable and very practical and easy to drive for anyone with a boat licence.\r\nThe Final hull came to a length of 14 meters overall and a beam of 3.875 meters. It has a cruising speed of 35 knots, and a top speed of 50 knots and it supplies accommodation for 6 people.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ravignon, Charles"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9000025,"sim:weight":0.347571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6200938,"sim:weight":0.340272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6200396,"sim:weight":0.325859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271236,"sim:weight":0.318904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106463,"sim:weight":0.292717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26693,"sim:weight":0.285009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27905,"sim:weight":0.282102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.262298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24902,"sim:weight":0.236288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.226002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.221018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.221018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.221018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.221018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.221018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.221018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.221018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.221018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.221018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.221018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Strategically and economically significant, it was often disregarded; however, its unique situation offers a microcosm of social and cultural development, which so far appears to have received little attention.\r\n \r\nFrom an island subjected to the will of outsiders, to a cultivated venue, which attracted and fostered cultural tourism, the purpose of this regional study is to trace the evolution of this vulnerable part of England and identify influential factors, which contributed towards its cultural constructions. \r\n\r\nThe hypothesis considers that the construction and consumption of the island was, throughout its history, driven by external forces. This theme is developed by relating cultural and social notions to island circumstances and identifying variables which contribute towards its unique situation.\r\n\r\nAn interdisciplinary approach utilizes mainland Britain as a historical matrix to illustrate cultural development; emphasizing determining circumstances, geographic, social, economic and aesthetic, to establish how the island was used, abused and ignored. Research is island focussed, though with corresponding allusion to metropolitan influence and middle-class cultural aspirations, which contributed to the island becoming a popular tourist destination.\r\n\r\nBy taking a broad historical overview it is apparent that due to location, the island was always an integral part of the British Isles, more significant than other outlying islands due to its relative proximity to the capital, the short distance to the mainland and its strategic importance both militarily and territorially. The progression of a connected narrative allows for an identification of features such as changing attitudes to the countryside and the sea which indicate an increasing consciousness, realized during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in cultural tourism, landscape art and relocation. This narrative structure is critical to establish the context for the primary focus of investigation, the period 1770- 1900 enabling an evaluation of the impact of visitors as consumers, landscape artists as interpreters, and the intertwining of these concepts to give an account of the evolution of cultural tourism on the Isle of Wight. \r\nThis is central for an appreciation of the ideas, tastes, and affinities expressed aesthetically in prints and paintings, physically in mansions and marine villas and conceptually in cultural conventions such as the notions of travel. It is a significant area for research, since the dynamics of cultural forces are universally relevant for an appreciation of social, historical and economic influences in the cultural domain. On a local level the cultural constructions examined within this study are areas which can be appraised to determine and develop constructive tourism and respond to future cultural needs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bek, Lynda"],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1496752,"sim:weight":0.437735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.407391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931333,"sim:weight":0.386919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108625,"sim:weight":0.369529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":852778,"sim:weight":0.331693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101270,"sim:weight":0.331128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340553,"sim:weight":0.303069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.301659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101516,"sim:weight":0.298433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446498,"sim:weight":0.295936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47236,"sim:weight":0.286745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382026,"sim:weight":0.282705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710674,"sim:weight":0.272505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.268372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.268372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.268372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.268372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.268372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.268372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.268372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In line with strategic plan (Southampton Solent University, 2008-13), it was essential to look into the current provisions, students and employer perception of the courses, and gather information to support development of new courses and enhance the existing portfolio to provide high quality learning and teaching in the courses.  This study was funded by the Strategic Development Programme with an aim to establish the currency and relevancy of the BE courses.  \r\nAn online survey of employers and alumni was carried out followed by two workshops. A desk study of 25 Universities with similar course provisions was carried out.  The finding of the study suggest that employers  and alumni are  satisfied with the course provisions  in terms of the delivery  teaching, course content, and what the student learn; there are some opportunities for the broaden the provision but no specific high demand areas were identified. Alumni were happy with the course and have suggested areas of enhancement of the course provision. The current 1 day part time day release model for part time learners was by far the most preferable form of part time delivery and employers were unsure any other alternative form of delivery would be effective for their businesses. However, some employers would consider options if more business specific courses are developed.  Employers have expressed their interest for support the course through guest lectures, providing access to construction sites and participating in university events. Solent has the lowest UCAS entry tariff points for BE course by far at 120 compared to the majority of our competitors who range between 220-260. This has highlighted an urgent need to increase entry points to maintain credibility and widen the appeal of the Built Environment courses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marasini, Ramesh","Barfoot, John"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":6201257,"ep:Repository":104,"dc:type":["Thesis","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Project-based Foreign Language Training Programme for Chinese Companies and Organisations: Towards Effective International Communication Strategy","bibo:abstract":"The rapid development of China’s economy has seen increasing demand for foreign language training in Chinese companies and organizations. Nevertheless educational institutions across the world have struggled to design appropriate foreign language training programmes for Chinese companies and organisations. Many models have been proposed and put into practice. However, little research has focussed attention on the actual needs of Chinese staff and the real demands of Chinese organizations and companies, so there is a continuing dilemma in terms of satisfying expectations of both training providers and trainees.\r\nThis research aims to develop and test a project-based foreign language training model for Chinese employees. The model aims to develop the ability of foreign language training suppliers to establish a management strategy for project-based training involving international educational communication. A series of propositions have been generated based on the two-tier levels of project-based training model designed in this research, which is based on the literature review of Chinese foreign language education, Chinese learning styles, organisational learning objectives, project-based foreign language learning theories and existing programme models. Initial research was also conducted to identify where training and development needs and deficits lie within China’s organisations and companies. Chinese staff and managers are chosen to investigate their attitudes. A mixed method of combining quantitative and qualitative analysis was employed in the research in order to validate these propositions.\r\nThe research has generated a number of successful outcomes relating to its aim and objectives. Firstly, individual project creation by Chinese trainees is a creative approach to meet learning objectives. Secondly, foreign language programmes need to aim to develop work-related or professional skills alongside language skills rather than learning the foreign language only. Thirdly, the divergence of perceptions in terms of training needs analysis and on-going assessment among Chinese staff and managers is discovered in the research. Fourthly, pedagogic design needs to blend formal instruction and independent learning. Fifthly, joint evaluation by bringing trainee, training providers and partners together customises evaluation. Sixthly, decision-making within Chinese organisations and companies involves top-down and bottom-up orientation. Additionally, understanding the operational structure of a training partner is important to the success of implementing a training programme through international educational management.  These contributions will add updated knowledge to education management and also enable further value to international educational institutions and practitioners.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhou, Zhen"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":50121,"sim:weight":0.535937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99399,"sim:weight":0.45828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109013,"sim:weight":0.454762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158997,"sim:weight":0.423082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59032,"sim:weight":0.390266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160632,"sim:weight":0.374336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9430865,"sim:weight":0.357064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45967,"sim:weight":0.33226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.330687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383355,"sim:weight":0.298357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.295822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.282236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.282236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.282236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.282236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.282236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.282236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.282236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.282236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.282236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It establishes a theoretical understanding for well-being in international law, European law and a pragmatic approach on how legal and policy instruments should be interpreted when assessing obligations for energy and sustainability. It then illustrates how various objectives are currently delivered across Europe. This leads to a theoretical and legal context for council members and officers working in local government with both mandatory duties and permitted powers available to advance the carbon emissions and fuel poverty agenda in their communities. The thesis evaluates the implications of ultra vires and judicial review on local authority behaviour in hand with the Local Government Act 1999 (Best Value) and suggests the combination has restricted positive action by the majority of local authorities in areas crucial to the well-being of many vulnerable residents. Compounding this, the subsequent Local Government Act 2000 (Powers of Well-Being) is currently underused due to a lack of legal certainty about their interpretation or realisation of their potential to address substantive community issues. To help counter the issue the thesis provides a theoretical context and working definition for energy and sustainability in local government which aligns Aristotelian thought and the principles of sustainable development. Then a practical example illustrates how energy and sustainability projects could be used to achieve wider community well-being. The thesis concludes by offering local government is under an implied duty to promote well-being and it should not defer actions on the grounds of the absence of a mandatory duty in the area. It must look to its history in public health reform in order to recognise the substantive issues of the day involving energy and poverty. It must become more outward looking, exploratory and adventurous in scope and find the political will to address the issues and the moral courage to direct resources to long term solutions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haygarth, David"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1586756,"sim:weight":0.459854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155990,"sim:weight":0.451723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106931,"sim:weight":0.418958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586739,"sim:weight":0.401141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352138,"sim:weight":0.327497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158519,"sim:weight":0.317968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47601,"sim:weight":0.300939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709929,"sim:weight":0.297615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.287407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.285566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.285566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.285566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.285566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.285566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.285566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.285566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.285566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.285566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.285566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.285566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The effect of different intensity recommendations of consuming fruit and vegetables (F\u0026V) is less well documented. Evidence on aging and child populations support the positive correlation between activity and cognition, however research on this relationship in young populations is sparse.  The project aimed to determine the optimal intensity of recommendations in health behaviours in a student population and the effect of these on WM and SWB.  A between-subjects design tested adherence to recommendations, WM and SWB measured before and after the 6-week intervention. Student participants were randomly allocated to (i) Moderate F\u0026V (4 portions/day), (ii) High F\u0026V (7 portions/day), (iii) Moderate-intensity exercise (30 minutes 5 times/week), or (iv) High-intensity exercise (30 minutes 5 times/week) groups.  All participants completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), an assessment of F\u0026V consumption, the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) and a WM task. Groups 1 and 2 recorded F\u0026V portions eaten daily. Groups 3 and 4 recorded weekly exercise. After the intervention, participants completed a second WM task and the PANAS. The results are currently being analysed, but preliminary findings suggest the hypotheses were supported. We conclude that participants are more likely to adhere to moderate programmes and moreover to diet rather than exercise behaviour. Furthermore, increased engagement in health behaviours improves WM and SWB.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tijou, Imogen","Mair, Carolyn","McKensie, Sophie"],"dc:date":"2012-04-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43807,"sim:weight":0.372112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101530,"sim:weight":0.34964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709948,"sim:weight":0.30233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187616,"sim:weight":0.301307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1663875,"sim:weight":0.264625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":79782,"sim:weight":0.259294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86101,"sim:weight":0.253303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53278,"sim:weight":0.249343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.238725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23873,"sim:weight":0.238725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1337275,"sim:weight":0.213826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229645,"sim:weight":0.212797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101416,"sim:weight":0.204169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43341,"sim:weight":0.191273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145298,"sim:weight":0.184882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22729,"sim:weight":0.179377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158974,"sim:weight":0.179033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.178839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102958,"sim:weight":0.176145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710162,"sim:weight":0.176079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":8766912,"ep:Repository":104,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Clothing Europe","bibo:abstract":"European politicians and decision makers face an interesting challenge in persuading local populations of the need to appreciate and continue to support other communities and nationalities within the Union. Typically, support is provided by economic means. However, the current global financial crisis makes this approach problematic.  Thus rather than propose another economic route to support and unite our neighbours, we aim to make apparent and extend existing unity through clothing and its narrative. This novel approach will invite partner countries to enter a European competition in which local clothing is provided with a narrative that explores and describes its historical context. Each partner country will select a winning entry which will be exhibited in a travelling European-wide exhibition. \r\nThe objective is to exploit an open, accessible communication medium to highlight simultaneously the uniqueness of each partner country as well as its commonalities. The project partners in each country will be selected for their particular skills. For example, while the UK researchers will manage the project, the partner in Portugal will manage the final exhibition. The management of the contributions by partner countries will be the responsibility of each country. However the entire project will be overseen by the UK team. This exciting project could not be conducted in the UK alone. The international nature of the design necessitates international partners. Therefore, even before the start of the project, some unification and further understanding of differences across the partner countries is taking place.\r\nThe research matters because it will provide a forum for debate about the cultural richness within the European Union. Moreover, it will promote the value of diversity while exhibiting unity. It is cost effective as each partner will contribute effort equally in the most economic way. This will be achieved through open competition within each country. The main expense will be the travelling exhibition at the end of the project. However, we argue this is justified by the media attention it will attract to communicate the aims of the project.\r\nThe impact will be far-reaching. Academics and researchers working in communication, fashion, psychology and other social sciences will be part of the European research team, thus findings from the project will be widely disseminated across a range of disciplines. The partner counties will be promoted by their winning entry and associated narrative at the travelling exhibition. This presence will enhance interest in these countries, potentially leading to new industry and tourism opportunities and ultimately the country’s economics.\r\nIn addition to academic and industry dissemination, the project partners will engage in web presence from the start of the project. This will be maintained by each partner overseen by the UK research team. Audiences at the travelling exhibition will be invited to record comments on the exhibits on electronic whiteboards which will feed directly to the web. This again is novel and will attract media attention across Europe.\r\nIn sum, we propose to use clothing to unite and support partner countries in the European Union. Each country will invite entries to a competition in which the use narrative about clothing and the clothing itself gives some ‘taste’ of the particular country. A winning entry will be selected and included in a travelling exhibition at which audience members will be invited to comment on the exhibits via electronic whiteboards. Comments will be relayed to the website. Dissemination will be via this website as well as through academic and industrial conferences, journals and other media.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mair, Carolyn","King, Ian"],"dc:date":"2012-06-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.320684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.316439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.316439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.316439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.316439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.316439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.316439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.316439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.316439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.316439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.316439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.316439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.316439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.316439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.316439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.300025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664531,"sim:weight":0.297051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162458,"sim:weight":0.289075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090812,"sim:weight":0.277495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.267627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Consequently they are often disappointed. This can lead to a consumer mentality (‘I have paid for my degree’), and increased attrition rates. Several complex issues affect such behaviour and an obvious starting point is to understand how to manage students’ expectations. Evidence suggests relationships among metacognition, confidence and academic performance. However, boosting confidence per se may be undesirable, as over and under confidence lead to unrealistic expectations. In higher education, the problem is apparent when dissatisfaction when the actual outcome (i.e., grade or classification) does not correspond with students’ expectations. \r\n\r\nObjective\r\nIn order to address these issues, underlying cognitive strategies were developed by means of metacognitive instruction and critical reflection. The role and interaction of metacognition and confidence with expectations was investigated to understand if there exists an optimal confidence level for making realistic expectations.\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\nStudent participants undertook the instructional and reflection activities, which were neither assessed nor monitored (to encourage disclosure), in part fulfilment of their coursework. Fully informed consent for the analysis of resultant data was given in advance. Students were allocated to a ‘reading’ or ‘questionnaire’ group. They completed an inventory to measure self-reported metacognitive awareness and were asked to predict the time and date they would complete their next assessment and the grade they would be awarded. Metacognitive training materials were uploaded weekly for the 6-week study period. Group 1 completed a reading activity each week. Group 2 completed a questionnaire-type activity. All materials focused on metacognition. In addition, each week, participants critically reflected using a structured reflection sheet. At the end of the 6-week period, the inventories were again administered. Baseline scores from the inventories were compared with post study scores, content analysis was conducted on the reflections and students’ predicted dates and grades were compared with actual dates and grades.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nMetacognitive awareness and knowledge increased from before to after the study (according to the inventories and the reflection spreadsheets). A negative association was noted between prediction accuracy and both high and low metacognition (assessed using the inventories). A positive correlation was noted between prediction accuracy and high metacognition (assessed using the reflection spreadsheets).\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nIn order to make realistic predictions, metacognitive skills, including deep self-awareness and monitoring, need to be developed. Content analysis was a better predictor of improvement than using self-report measures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carolyn, Mair"],"dc:date":"2012-03-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2695060,"sim:weight":0.556568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8827049,"sim:weight":0.388555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1593488,"sim:weight":0.361053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46622,"sim:weight":0.309072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448002,"sim:weight":0.302559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.275452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160793,"sim:weight":0.273609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160794,"sim:weight":0.272149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.27194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.270904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.269803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2846,"sim:weight":0.26263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664559,"sim:weight":0.260633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41233,"sim:weight":0.257595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154506,"sim:weight":0.255069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.251575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108385,"sim:weight":0.249714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385743,"sim:weight":0.248613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.243831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710162,"sim:weight":0.240481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the United Kingdom, for instance, credit monies emanating from private banks constitute 97% of circulating currency (Shakespeare 2002). This paper reviews elements of the classically-derived mainstream view, and its critics, and evaluates the claims of monetary reformers. Stephen Zarlenga, for instance, in his historical study of the political economy of money, suggests that the (unnecessary) acceptance of the private creation of money precludes the possibility of a state-sanctioned ‘money of account’ (Zarlenga 2002).This cartalist notion of state-money, (perhaps mistakenly) citing Aristotelian origin, is seen as indispensable for effective monetary reform today. It is proposed that money is issued and established by law that is deliberately intended to exceed its intrinsic value, when functioning as a measure of commodities. Yet, this paper argues that these reformist ideas have been unfair in their historical treatment of Marx, Smith and Keynes, who had more sophisticated ideas on monetary matters than is credited. Notwithstanding, Zarlenga’s (et al) work serves to illuminate an interesting arena for future research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mouatt, Simon"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However the nature and role of this power, relative to other power sources, has been difficult to determine.  This paper discusses Susan Strange’s theory of financial power, which indicates its function within present capitalist mechanics, and outlines the control of money as the primary (but not exclusive) source of power that determines outcomes and historical transition. The power of productive capitalists is seen as a secondary source to financial power since the trajectory of production is determined by the vagaries of state and market, whereas the control of money is not constrained in the same manner. The paper suggests, therefore, that the notion of finance capital is a false one since although at most times the interests of financial and productive powers converge, centred on wealth creation, this is not always the case. In times of a conflict of interest financial powers will predominate as they seek to retain their relative proportions of power in global order. Financial powers constitute, therefore, the bourgeosie of the modern era.\r\n\r\nUsing these concepts the paper then investigates the binary economics of Louis Kelso as a vehicle to engender the use of financial power for the purposes of crisis prevention and even development. This involves the state issue of ‘interest-free’ money and the wider social ownership of capital incomes that would weaken the financial power of private bankers.  Redistribution and enhanced multilateral regulatory capacity, in substantial form, are seen as desirable for the present capitalist order although it is recognised that there is neither the political will nor necessary consensus.  It also ironically suggests that, at present rates of credit accumulation, debt could ultimately be replaced by redistribution as the only means of sustaining the interests of global capital and neo-liberalism.

The rise of the joint-stock firm, for instance, suggested that (investment) banks had gained decision-making power over the corporate(s) through integration – the Hilferding notion of finance capital  (Hilferding 1910; Lenin 1996). Substantial tribute is also, of course, extracted from the economy in the form of interest.   I argued, in a previous AHE paper, that financial rentiers are now less integrated, strengthening their position relative to productive capitalists (Mouatt 2005). Hedge funds and private-equity firms that ‘short-sell’ leveraged funds for instance, that are authorised by the decisions of private bankers, are able to manipulate currency and stock prices that can belie the market fundamentals and bamboozle small investors. Redistributive accumulation, asset stripping, and corporate monopolization can then follow any subsequent currency (or share-price) shock. It seems that finance (and those that control it) has triumphed. Yet, there are contemporary signs of systemic weakness. Banks are increasingly exposed to the vagaries of international financial markets and earn a smaller proportion of profit from interest. In addition, firms are now less dependent on the bankers, as a result of retained profits, and are also further developing their own monies, payment systems and banks. This financial innovation, with new circulation channels, requires a re-think on (modern) money.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mouatt, Simon"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This work, in the main, has assumed the use of (real) commodity-money following Marx.  Yet, can monies derived from credit be inserted in the models as appropriate monetary equivalents? This paper seeks to argue that they can, without any compromise of established TSSI principles. The endogenous money paradigm (EMP), as Naito notes, is generally accepted by many economists today and, this would therefore be an important step towards a modern Marxian monetary theory (Naito 2008). The paper further argues that, despite some ambiguities in his work, a more realistic (modern) conception of money can be derived from Marx.

Yet, this paper contends, both paradigms are predicated on the fanciful notion that a steady-state capitalism can exist. The Marxian financialisation school, conversely, recognizes the systemic propensity to crisis and, further maintains that the recent survival of capitalism can be attributed to the decline of real wages and excessive levels of (unsustainable) debt. Yet, all three approaches ignore Marx’s own (objective) claim that the profit rate has a secular tendency to fall that, in turn, impacts investment and (indirectly) creates pre-conditions for financial sector instability. Through the illustration of a steam train, this paper seeks to demonstrate these monetary dynamics and suggests that a restoration of the profit rate is imperative for the sustainability of capitalism (as defined).

However, the purpose of this brief note is to illustrate that his description of the unit of (objective) measurement, utilised by Marx’s theory of value (LTV), appears inconsistent with Marx’s own work or, at best, is poorly explained.

In order to address that crisis this chapter outlines a proposal for the structural reform of a national monetary system, with practical and beneficial consequences.  It is recognised, of course, that monetary reform per se is not a holistic panacea to all of our global ills. Yet, it is hoped that the incremental transition recommended, using the national bank to issue interest-free currency (credit-money), could promote the cause of social and economic justice through a more sustainable monetary system. In addition, interest-free currency could be used to finance other reform proposals such as the spread of capital ownership or the creation of a basic income. At the core of the reform is the insight that, usury (defined here as an interest-charge in excess of justifiable administration cost) is not necessary. Whilst it can be argued that administration charges, collateral and properly conceived repayment plans are imperative for the proper functioning of credit markets, usury is not so easily defended (especially for state expenditure) unless the motive is to profit the private financial sector and their investors","bibo:AuthorList":["Challen, Peter","Shakespeare, Rodney","Mouatt, Simon","Mouatt, Simon","Adams, Carl"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9050745,"sim:weight":0.418096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106038,"sim:weight":0.336877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5074485,"sim:weight":0.325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101473,"sim:weight":0.317045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383382,"sim:weight":0.31561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44471,"sim:weight":0.312202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710223,"sim:weight":0.305258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43753,"sim:weight":0.301156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108333,"sim:weight":0.2944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145771,"sim:weight":0.287146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108296,"sim:weight":0.282935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664696,"sim:weight":0.27891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187751,"sim:weight":0.276085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090442,"sim:weight":0.269951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710553,"sim:weight":0.26947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.263736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43767,"sim:weight":0.259192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46864,"sim:weight":0.252208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43599,"sim:weight":0.245658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43805,"sim:weight":0.240116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The many unique aspects of the international maritime industry make the wholesale adoption of established criteria from another industry inappropriate.\r\n\r\nThe initial stage of this research – presented at the 4th International Conference on Maritime Human Resource Solutions in 2010 - set out to identify if the broad competence criteria described in the STCW revisions would be consistently interpreted by a range of industry stakeholders, in the context of the behaviours that they would expect to see, hear or experience that would demonstrate compliance with, and evidence competence in, the criteria.\r\n\r\nTo this end, data was collected by purposeful sampling of industry stakeholders and semi-structured interviews undertaken.  Effective and ineffective markers were then developed.\r\n\r\nThe second stage of research has now been completed.  This paper will report on how these markers were validated for effectiveness and utility in WMA deck and engine simulators, and consider some implementation considerations.\r\nThese behavioural markers will enable industry to assess the performance of the deck and engine room teams and to improve selection, training and promotion processes and procedures for Merchant Navy officers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Devitt, Katherine","Holford, Simon","Pantaleev, Branimir","Sharma, Davinder"],"bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Review and Synthesis of the Evolution of African Industrial Cluster Studies","bibo:abstract":"Purpose: The objective of the study is to derive a classification of emerging themes and determinants of industrial clusters evolution in Africa on the basis of comprehensive review and synthesis of the literature.\r\n\r\nDesign/ methodology/approach: The study performed a comprehensive and systematic literature review of 25 articles over a period of at least 30 years (1980- up to 2000’s). The study is conducted using a deductive approach to trace the advances made in the field of African cluster studies from the perspective of evolutionary approaches.\r\n\r\nFindings: The study finds at least five emerging themes including: networks; spatial features (both institutional \u0026 infrastructural); learning \u0026 knowledge competences; and culture as determinants of evolutionary change in African clusters. It also identifies a direct relationship between the changing features of African clusters and the empirical investigations undertaken by scholars in the field. \r\n\r\nResearch Limitations: The lack of extensive research on African clusters limited the number of articles reviewed in this study. Thus, the findings of this study are limited for us to draw generic conclusions about the evolution and entrepreneurial development of all African clusters.\r\n\r\nOriginality/value: The paper identifies gaps in the literature for researchers intending to further study African clusters and its evolution in time. Policy makers in Africa can use the findings of this study to facilitate or stimulate the evolution of clusters. For example they could intervene to upgrade networks, facilitate knowledge and learning, build infrastructures, and empower local institutions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Taura, Nasiru"],"dc:date":"2012-11-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.237543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.237543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.237543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.237543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.237543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.237543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.237543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.237543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.237543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.237543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.237543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.237543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.237543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.237543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.233573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.226516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585528,"sim:weight":0.225245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710651,"sim:weight":0.218806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187643,"sim:weight":0.218016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.211235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Through the creative practice of curatorial project work the unity of discourse between reflection and practice can be attributed to mapping and developing the knowledge’s of fashion practice experienced and exploited through the practice portfolio or exhibition.\r\n\r\nThere is opportunity for professional doctorates of design practice to develop insightful methodological approaches informed through the design process of practice.  The context of this research paper is the learning experience of a professional doctorate study that focuses on developing and evaluating a fashion (design) practice process of constructing the fashion narrative in a contemporary context. \r\n\r\nResearch suggests that present texts on design practice, reflective practice, visual anthropology and curation are still not effectively informing creative-authorship of practice as portfolio or exhibition of Design Practice.  The fashion commerce and fashion cultural industries have much to gain in linking theory with practice towards a better understanding of what designers do, in, through and of practice.\r\n\r\nThe research concludes that a conscious ‘seeing’ exists as a pure discourse of fashion practice toward an understanding of what designers \u0027do\u0027 in thought and action and how the spectator can apply critical gaze to understand, perform, and respond to fashion practice in both a commercial and cultural context that is to be collectively understood; and that this achievement can be effectively facilitated through engagement with a professional doctorate programme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Norris-Reeves, S.R.","Raeside-Elliott, F.J.","Hilton, K.H."],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Ajjawi and J Higgs.

The new work was commissioned as part of the art at the Heart project that aims to raise awareness of the new arts complex that will be completed in Southampton in 2014/15. Embodied Memories is a study in the relationship between place, clothing and identity through the creation of a new body of work in response to verbal descriptions of clothing, jewellery and accessories and in particular the gaps and absences in those recollections.  This practice of referencing resonates with the repetitive nature of couture- designers of couture garments continually refer to cultural and sartorial history.\r\nThe exhibition of the clothing, accessories and jewellery as art objects combined with the use of some of these pieces in creating a series of styled fashion editorial images enabled me to expand my theoretical enquiry into my position as practitioner who is both artist and stylist.  Through practical application the work aims to contribute to emerging international discussion about the role of the stylist; I was interested in identifying the point at which my roles and practices differ and where they merge, at times the practice becoming difficult to distinguish as an art practice or a styling practice. Key texts that have influenced the work: Barthes, R Camera Lucida and Wilson, E Adorned in Dreams: Fashion and Modernity. Significance: The exhibition forms part of a very recent exhibition discourse into the role of the fashion stylist as practitioner, following Simon Foxton: When You’re a Boy at the Photographers Gallery in 2009.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anyan, Jennifer"],"dc:date":"2012-05-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
