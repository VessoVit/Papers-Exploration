{"identifier":15707,"ep:Repository":70,"dc:type":["Study Group Report","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Transport and Reaction Processes in Soil","bibo:abstract":"In order to register agrochemicals in Europe it is necessary to have a detailed understanding of the processes in the environment that break down agrochemicals. The existing framework for environmental assessment includes a consideration of soil water movement and microbial breakdown of products in soil and these processes are relatively understood and represented in models. However the breakdown of agrochemicals by the action of light incident on the soil surface by a process termed photolysis is not so well represented in models of environmental fate.\r\n\r\nThe problem brought by Syngenta (one of the worlds leading agrochemical companies) to the workshop was how to include the effects of light degradation of chemicals into predictive models of environmental fate.\r\n\r\nPhotolysis is known to occur in a very thin layer at the surface of soil. The workshop was asked to consider how the very rough nature of the upper surface of a ploughed field might affect the degradation of chemicals by sunlight. The discussions were directed down two avenues:\r\n- firstly to determine how the very small distances over which photolysis occurs might be adequately incorporated into models of transport in soils and,\r\n- secondly to consider how the rough surface might modify the illumination of the surface and hence alter degradation.\r\n\r\nThe rate of degradation by photolysis is measured in the laboratory by illuminating a thin, typically about 1 or 2 mm, layer of soil with very strong xenon lamps. The amount of chemical is measured at various intervals and is fitted to a first-order process. Field experiments where the chemical is sprayed on a bare field show evidence of photolysis indicated by biphasic degradation patterns and the presence of breakdown products only formed by photolysis.\r\n\r\nThis report addresses methods for mathematically modelling the action of photolysis on particular relevant chemical species. We start with a general discussion of mechanisms that transport chemicals within soil §2. There is an existing computational model exploited by Syngenta for such modelling and we discuss how this performs and the predictions that can be derived using it §3.\r\nThe particular mechanism of photolysis is then considered. One aspect of this mechanism that is investigated is how the roughness of the surface of the soil could be adequately incorporated into the modelling. Some results relating to this are presented §4.2. Some of the original experimental data used to derive aspects of the model of photolysis are revisited and a simple model of the process presented and shown to fit the data very well §5.\r\nBy considering photolysis with a constant diffusion coefficient various analytical results are derived and general behaviour of the system outlined. This simple model is then applied to real field-based data and shown to give very good fit when simply extended to account for the moisture variations by utilising moisture dependent diffusion coefficients derived from the existing computational model §5.3. Some consequences of the simple model are then discussed §6.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arab, N","Bazarganzadeh, Reza","Ceseri, M","Gallimore, Laura","Lacey, Andrew","Lustri, Chris","Majdodin, Rooholah","Ockendon, John","Please, Colin","Seguis, Jean-Charles","Shabala, Alex","Smith, Amy","Smith, Nadia","Somfai, E","Whittaker, Robert"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Bear.

{"identifier":15748,"ep:Repository":70,"dc:type":["Study Group Report","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Arc Phenomena in low-voltage current limiting circuit breakers","bibo:abstract":"Circuit breakers are an important safety feature in most electrical circuits, and they act to prevent excessive currents caused by short circuits, for example. Low-voltage current limiting circuit breakers are activated by a trip solenoid when a critical current is exceeded. The solenoid moves two contacts apart to break the circuit. However, as soon as the contacts are separated an electric arc forms between them, ionising the air in the gap, increasing the electrical conductivity of air to that of the hot plasma that forms, and current continues to flow. The currents involved may be as large as 80,000 amperes.\r\n\r\nCritical to the success of the circuit breaker is that it is designed to cause the arc to move away from the contacts, into a widening wedge-shaped region. This lengthens the arc, and then moves it onto a series of separator plates called an arc divider or splitter.\r\n\r\nThe arc divider raises the voltage required to sustain the arcs across it, above the voltage that is provided across the breaker, so that the circuit is broken and the arcing dies away. This entire process occurs in milliseconds, and is usually associated with a sound like an explosion and a bright ash from the arc. Parts of the contacts and the arc divider may melt and/or vapourise.\r\n\r\nThe question to be addressed by the Study Group was to mathematically model the arc motion and extinction, with the overall aim of an improved understanding that would help the design of a better circuit breaker.\r\n\r\nFurther discussion indicated that two key mechanisms are believed to contribute to the movement of the arc away from the contacts, one being self-magnetism (where the magnetic field associated with the arc and surrounding circuitry acts to push it towards the arc\r\ndivider), and the other being air flow (where expansion of air combined with the design of the chamber enclosing the arc causes gas flow towards the arc divider).\r\n\r\nFurther discussion also indicated that a key aspect of circuit breaker design was that it is desirable to have as fast a quenching of the arc as possible, that is, the faster the circuit breaker can act to stop current flow, the better. The relative importance of magnetic and air pressure effects on quenching speed is of central interest to circuit design.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thompson, Alice B.","Richardson, G.","Dellar, Paul","McGuinness, M.","Budd, Chris"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.526284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890288,"sim:weight":0.380678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76807,"sim:weight":0.378556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145764,"sim:weight":0.359721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47066,"sim:weight":0.358995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9023859,"sim:weight":0.358666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1568384,"sim:weight":0.356119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.348851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890329,"sim:weight":0.347895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97223,"sim:weight":0.344754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96505,"sim:weight":0.341816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1568171,"sim:weight":0.338581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270137,"sim:weight":0.332529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.332378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1568205,"sim:weight":0.32748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108096,"sim:weight":0.326448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383227,"sim:weight":0.320661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154348,"sim:weight":0.319925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269863,"sim:weight":0.316416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271208,"sim:weight":0.315278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Improved designs are currently under investigation, and one that is promising is the double gate MOSFET.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding device characteristics is critical for the design of MOSFETs as part of design tools for integrated circuits such as SPICE. Current methods involve the numerical solution of PDEs governing electron transport. Numerical solutions are accurate, but do not provide an appropriate way to optimize the design of the device, nor are they suitable for use in chip simulation software such as SPICE. As chips contain more and more transistors, this problem will get more and more acute.\r\n\r\nThere is hence a need for analytic solutions of the equations governing the performance of MOSFETs, even if these are approximate. Almost all solutions in the literature treat the long-channel case (thin devices) for which the PDEs reduce to ODEs. The goal of this problem is to produce analytical solutions based on the underlying PDEs that are rapid to compute (e.g. require solving only a small number of algebraic equations rather than systems of PDEs).\r\n\r\nGuided by asymptotic analysis, a fast numerical procedure has been developed to obtain approximate solutions of the governing PDEs governing MOSFET properties, namely electron density, Fermi potential and electrostatic potential. The approach depends on the channel’s being long enough, and appears accurate in this limit.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ahmed, Saleem","Breward, Chris","Crowdy, Darren","Cumberbatch, Ellis","Davis, Anthony","Fehribach, Joseph D.","Grigsby, Mike","Hall, Cameron","Smith, Stefan Llewellyn"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Q Chen, E Harrell and D Meindl.

The primary objective of the \"sequence alignment\" problem is to search for a new algorithm that facilitates the use of two-base encoded data for large-scale re-sequencing projects. This algorithm should be able to perform local sequence alignment as well as error detection and correction in a reliable and systematic manner, enabling the direct comparison of encoded DNA sequence reads to a candidate reference DNA sequence.\r\n\r\nWe will first briefly review two well-known sequence alignment approaches and provide a rudimentary improvement for implementation on parallel systems. Then, we carefully examin a unique sequencing technique known as the SOLiDTM System that can be implemented, and follow by the results from the global and local sequence alignment.\r\n\r\nIn this report, the team presents an explanation of the algorithms for color space sequence data from the high-throughput re-sequencing technology and a theoretical parallel approach to the dynamic programming method for global and local alignment. The combination of the di-base approach and dynamic programming provides a possible viewpoint for large-scale re-sequencing projects. We anticipate the use of distributed computing to be the next-generation engine for large-scale problems like such.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chang, Jen-Mei","Drakes, Chiaka","Huang, Erya","Langat, Deidrey","McGrath, Joseph","Morabito, Mark","Pacheco, Jose","Rodriguez, Nancy","Salazar, Daniel","Vemuri, Rao","Vu, Man","Wadhar, Hem","Wu, Qin"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2008).

The goal of this project was to rigorously identify contaminants that affect fish, and by extension, humans, using microarray data. This is done by finding genes that are differentially expressed in fish under normal conditions and under treatment by 8 different chemical families PCB-126, Bis-A, Cd, Pb, Hg, Phenantharene, Estradiol and Testosterone. EcoArray uses a proprietary black-box software program called GeneSpring to identify differentially expressed genes that could serve as bio-markers for the 8 different contaminants. The goal of this workshop problem was to develop a statistically robust method of identifying differentially expressed genes given replicate measurements with very different levels of variability.\r\n\r\nThe top ranking results of our CyberT analysis on the data supplied by EcoArray are markedly different from those obtained earlier by EcoArray using the black box routines implemented in GeneSpring. The output of CyberT on the data are genes that have high differential expression and low variance among the replicates. This suggests that we have implemented a statistically robust method for identifying differentially expressed genes and used it successfully on the data. A further indicator that our method produces more accurate bio-markers is the following: the biomarkers chosen for Cd and Hg by our method have a high degree of overlap and this makes biochemical sense given the similarity between these two toxins - the output produced by GeneSpring did not have this additional signature of consistency.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bhan, Ashish","Kesir, Mustafa","Malioutov, Mikhail B."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A M Schena, D Shalon, R W Davis and P O Brown.

Additional diagnostic measures require development before a routine can be developed whereby a complete diagnostic report can be generated as output using simulated and historical data as input. This work includes:\r\n(1) Further partitioning of output load and prices from an ESE into off-peak, peak and weekend periods to determine the subsequent effect on earnings.\r\n(2) The diagnosis of simulated load paths. As simulated load was not supplied for all engines, the diagnostics developed in this report did not include an analysis of load.\r\n(3) The building of a response surface to capture the interaction between temperature, load and price.\r\n(4) Examination of the convergence behaviour of an ESE. Convergence in this context means the determination of the minimum number of load and price paths required from a simulator in order to return expected profiles that conform to industry expectations. This would involve the sequential testing of an increasing number of simulated paths from an ESE in order to determine the number required.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is important to understand that each of the simulators that were diagnosed in this study were criticised according to industry expectations, and to the degree that the diagnostics employed here reflect those expectations. In fact, all simulators will attract criticism given that they are calibrated on historical data and are expected to generate future prices for market conditions that are unknown. The mark of an appropriate ESE is that the future load and pricing structure it generates is not too much at variance with industry expectations. A critical function of a simulator is for it not to overestimate or underestimate load and prices such that the risk metrics used to govern earnings risk faced by an electricity retailer are compromised to the extent that their book is either grossly over-hedged or under-hedged.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chiarella, Carl","Svec, Jiri","Stevenson, Max"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2004).

{"identifier":15783,"ep:Repository":70,"dc:type":["Study Group Report","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Analysis of coil slumping","bibo:abstract":"Steel strip is usually stored as a coil, which will slump to some degree after the removal of the mandrel. More often than not, the amount of slumping is so minor that it is assumed not to have occurred. Occasionally, the amount, though minor, is sufficient to compromise the integrity of the cylindrical bore which compromises subsequent handling of the coil. In extreme situations, the slumping progresses to a complete collapse of the coil. Such a collapse is rare. It occurs when a coil cannot hold up its own mass and loses its circular cross-section. It is thought to be principally associated with the size and weight of the coil, inappropriate coiling tensions and/or poor re-coiler equipment design. Strip properties, especially inter-strip contact characteristics, have been demonstrated experimentally to be crucial determinants of whether or not coil collapse is likely to occur.\r\n\r\nThe particular kind of slumping/collapse of interest to BlueScope Steel, who proposed this Study Group problem, is the minor slumping that compromises cylindrical bore integrity. It is referred to as coil slump. \r\n\r\nThe Study Group was asked to investigate and model the phenomenon of coil slumping, and, if possible, to quantify the effect of critical parameters, especially coil mass, strip thickness and inter-strip friction. In particular, it was suggested that deliberations should aim to characterize the geometry of slumping and to predict the deformation profile at the innermost and outermost wraps.\r\n\r\nFor BlueScope Steel, the long term objectives are:\r\n(1) the formulation of the governing equations for the stresses in a coil under self-weight,\r\n(2) the identification of analytical solutions and/or numerical schemes for the final coil shape after slumping, and\r\n(3) the formulation of exclusion rules-of-thumb which predict when a particular form of slump (oval or triangular) is likely to occur.\r\n\r\nThe Study Group made some progress with (1), limited progress with (2) and most progress with (3). Though various computer programs were written to explore different force and energy balance scenarios, they only scratched the surface with regards to (2). Success with it is heavily dependent in substantial progress being made with (1). As explained in detail in the sequel, the Study Group’s deliberations resulted in an improved understanding of the coil slumping/collapse problem by identifying a number of specific issues that should be of direct assistance to BlueScope Steel’s future management of coil slumping/collapse.\r\n\r\nIn particular, such issues included the need, from a modelling perspective, to draw a clear distinction between minor slumping and major slumping which can subsequently lead to collapse; the formulation of a heuristic hypothesis about the dynamics of coil slumping/collapse which can be compared with historical data and act act as a conceptualization guide for further investigations; the identification of a “tension-weight ratio” (R) as the relevant dimensionless group which represents an indicative rule-of-thumb which can be applied in practice; and proposed, on the basis of the hypothesis, an efficient procedure for recording collapse events and statistically identifying possible collapse situations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anderssen, Bob","Fowkes, Neville","Hickson, Roslyn","McGuinness, Mark"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H C Altmann.

{"identifier":15785,"ep:Repository":70,"dc:type":["Study Group Report","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Modelling Li+ Ion Battery Electrode Properties","bibo:abstract":"We formulated two detailed models for an electrolytic cell with particulate electrodes based on a lithium atom concentration dependent Butler-Volmer condition at the interface between electrode particles and the electrolyte. The first was based on a dilute-ion assumption for the electrolyte, while the second assumed that Li ions are present in excess.\r\n\r\nFor the first, we used the method of multiple scales to homogenize this model over the microstructure, formed by the small lithium particles in the electrodes.\r\nFor the second, we gave rigorous bounds for the effective electrochemical conductivity for a linearized case.\r\nWe expect similar results and bounds for the \"full nonlinear problem\" because variational results are generally not adversely affected by a sinh term.\r\n\r\nFinally we used the asymptotic methods, based on parameters estimated from the literature, to attain a greatly simplified one-dimensional version of the original homogenized model. This simplified model accounts for the fact that diffusion of lithium atoms within individual electrode particles is relatively much faster than that of lithium ions across the whole cell so that lithium ion diffusion is what limits the performance of the battery. However, since most of the potential drop occurs across the Debye layers surrounding each electrode particle, lithium ion diffusion only significantly affects cell performance if there is more or less complete depletion of lithium ions in some region of the electrolyte which causes a break in the current flowing across the cell. This causes catastrophic failure. Providing such failure does not occur the potential drop across the cell is determined by the concentration of lithium atoms in the electrode particles. Within each electrode lithium atom concentration is, to leading order, a function of time only and not of position within the electrode. The depletion of electrode lithium atom concentration is directly proportional to the current being drawn off the cell. This leads one to expect that the potential of the cell gradually drops as current is drawn of it.\r\n\r\nWe would like to emphasize that all the homogenization methods employed in this work give a systematic approach for investigating the effect that changes in the microstructure have on the behaviour of the battery. However, due to lack of time, we have not used this method to investigate particular particle geometries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anderson, D. M.","Bohun, C. S.","Breward, C.","Fehribach, J.

These equations were reconsidered here with the additional reduction that the hole, i.e. the gas bubble, was thin as compared to the radius of the fiber and of finite extent. The primary model considered was one in which the mass of the gas inside the bubble was fixed. This fixed-mass model involved equations for the axial velocity and fiber radius, and equations for the radius of the bubble and the gas pressure inside the bubble. The model equations assumed that the temperature of the furnace of the drawing tower was known.\r\n\r\nThe governing equations of the bubble are hyperbolic and predict that the bubble cannot extend beyond the limiting characteristics specified by the ends of the initial bubble shape. An analysis of pinch-off was performed, and it was found that pinch-off can occur, depending on the parameters of the model, due to surface tension when the bubble radius is small.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the evolution of a bubble, a numerical method of solution was presented. The method was used to study the evolution of two different initial bubble shapes, one convex and the other non-convex. Both initial bubble shapes had fore-aft symmetry, and it was found that the bubbles stretched and elongated severely during the drawing process. For the convex shape, fore-aft symmetry was lost in the middle of the drawing process, but the symmetry was re-gained by the end of the drawing tower. A small amount of pinch-off was observed at each end for this case, so that the final bubble length was slightly shorter than its theoretical maximum length. For the non-convex initial shape, pinch-off occurred in the middle of the bubble resulting in two bubbles by the end of the fiber draw.\r\nThe two bubbles had different final pressures and did not have fore-aft symmetry.\r\n\r\nAn extension of the fixed-mass model was considered in which the gas in the bubble was allowed to diffuse into the surrounding glass. The governing equations for this leaky-mass model were developed and manipulated into a form suitable for a numerical treatment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Breward, C.","Cumberbatch, E.","Cummings, L.

A person is likely to have many plaques inside his/her body even if they are healthy. However plaques may become \"vulnerable\", \"high-risk\" or \"thrombosis-prone\" if the person engages in a high-fat diet and does not exercise regularly.\r\n\r\nIn this study group, we proposed two mathematical models to describe plaque growth and rupture.\r\nThe first model is a mechanical one that approximately treats the plaque as an inflating elastic balloon. In this model, the pressure inside the core increases and then decreases suggesting that plaque stabilization and prevention of rupture is possible.\r\nThe second model is a biochemical one that focuses on the role of MMPs in degrading the fibrous plaque cap. The cap stress, MMP concentration, plaque volume and cap thickness are coupled together in a system of phenomenological equations. The equations always predict an eventual rupture since the volume, stresses and MMP concentrations generally grow without bound. The main weakness of the model is that many of the important parameters that control the behavior of the plaque are unknown.\r\n\r\nThe two simple models suggested by this group could serve as a springboard for more realistic theoretical studies. But most importantly, we hope they will motivate more experimental work to quantify some of the important mechanical and biochemical properties of vulnerable plaques.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bell, J.","Breward, C.","Chou, T.","Fok, P.-W.","Haugh, J.

The most basic formulation of the question is called the \"max flow\" optimization problem: given a set of channels with prescribed capacities that connect a set of nodes in a network, how should the materials or information be distributed among the various routes to maximize the total flow rate from the source to the destination. Theory in linear programming has been well developed to solve the classic max flow problem. Modern contexts have demanded the examination of more complicated variations of the max flow problem to take new factors or constraints into consideration; these changes lead to more difficult problems where linear programming is insufficient. \r\n\r\nIn the workshop we examined models for information flow on networks that considered trade-offs between the overall network utility (or flow rate) and path diversity to ensure balanced usage of all parts of the network (and to ensure stability and robustness against local disruptions in parts of the network).\r\nWhile the linear programming solution of the basic max flow problem cannot handle the current problem, the approaches primal/dual formulation for describing the constrained optimization problem can be applied to the current generation of problems, called network utility maximization (NUM) problems. In particular, primal/dual formulations have been used extensively in studies of such networks.\r\nA key feature of the traffic-routing model we are considering is its formulation as an economic system, governed by principles of supply and demand. Considering channel capacities as a commodity of limited supply, we might suspect that a system that regulates traffic via a pricing scheme would assign prices to channels in a manner inversely proportional to their respective capacities.\r\nOnce an appropriate network optimization problem has been formulated, it remains to solve the optimization problem; this will need to be done numerically, but the process can greatly benefit from simplifications and reductions that follow from analysis of the problem. Ideally the form of the numerical solution scheme can give insight on the design of a distributed algorithm for a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that can be directly implemented on the network.\r\n\r\nAt the workshop we considered the optimization problems for two small prototype network topologies: the two-link network and the diamond network. These examples are small enough to be tractable during the workshop, but retain some of the key features relevant to larger networks (competing routes with different capacities from the source to the destination, and routes with overlapping channels, respectively). We have studied a gradient descent method for solving obtaining the optimal solution via the dual problem. The numerical method was implemented in MATLAB and further analysis of the dual problem and properties of the gradient method were carried out. Another thrust of the group\u0027s work was in direct simulations of information flow in these small networks via Monte Carlo simulations as a means of directly testing the efficiencies of various allocation strategies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Aralumallige, Deepak","Braun, Richard","Churchill, Aaron","Halliwell, Garry","Levinson, Michael","Li, Qingxia","Please, Colin","Rivas, Ivonne","Wang, Yi","Weber, Romann","Witelski, Tom"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"F Y Hunt and V Marbukh.

For both cases the length scale of the roughness along the surface is small as compared to the scale of the slider, so that a homogenization of the governing equations was performed.\r\n\r\nFor the case of longitudinal roughness, we derived a one-dimensional lubrication-type equation for the leading behavior of the pressure in the direction parallel to the velocity of the disk. The coefficients of the equation are determined by solving linear elliptic equations on a domain bounded by the gap height in the vertical direction and the period of the roughness in the span-wise direction.\r\n\r\nFor the case of transverse roughness the unsteady lubrication equations were reduced, following a multiple scale homogenization analysis, to a steady equation for the leading behavior of the pressure in the gap.

{"identifier":15816,"ep:Repository":70,"dc:type":["Study Group Report","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Gas Concentration Measurements in Underground Waste Storage Tanks","bibo:abstract":"Currently over 100 underground tanks at the Hanford facility in eastern Washington state are being used to store high-level radioactive waste. With plans for a long-term nuclear-waste repository in Nevada in place (though not yet approved), one promising use for these underground storage tanks is as a temporary waystation for waste destined for the Nevada repository. However, without a reasonable understanding of the chemical reactions going on within the tanks, transporting waste in and out of the tanks has been deemed to be unsafe.\r\n\r\nOne hazard associated with such storage mechanisms is explosion of flammable gases produced within the tank. Within many of the storage tanks is a sludge layer. This layer, which is a mixture of liquid and solids, contains most of the radioactive material. Radioactive decay and its associated heat can produce several flammable materials within this layer. Two components of particular concern are hydrogen (H2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), since they are highly volatile in the gaseous phase. Though the tanks have either forced or natural convection systems to vent these gases, the possibility of an explosion still exists.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of these gases are taken in several ways. Continuous measurements are taken in the headspace, which is the layer between the tank ceiling and the liquid (supernatant) or sludge layer below. In tanks where a supernatant layer sits atop the sludge layer, there are often rollovers or gas release events (GREs), where a large chunk of sludge, after attaining a certain void fraction, becomes buoyant, rising through the supernatant and releasing its associated gas composition to the headspace. Such changes trigger a sensor, and thus measurements are also taken at that time.\r\n\r\nLastly, a retained gas sample (RGS) can be taken from either the supernatant or sludge layer. Such a core sample is quite expensive, but can yield crucial data about the way gases are being produced in the sludge and convected through the supernatant.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the measurements from these three populations do not seem to match. In particular, the ratio r \u003d [N2O]/[H2] varies from population to population. r also varies from tank to tank, but this can more readily be explained in terms of the waste composition of each tank. Since H2 is more volatile than N2O (and since there are more sources of oxygen in the headspace), lower values of r correspond to more hazardous situations.\r\n\r\nThis variance in r is troubling, since we need to be able to explain why certain values of r are lower (and hence more dangerous) in certain areas of the tank. In this report we examine the data from three tanks. We first verify that the differences in r among populations is significant. We then postulate several mechanisms which could explain such a difference.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chapman, Jon","Chung, Young","Drew, Donald","Edwards, David A.","Fitt, Alistair","King, John"],"dc:date":"1997","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"RGS Calculations.

{"identifier":15818,"ep:Repository":70,"dc:type":["Study Group Report","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Interference Filters for Thermo-photovoltaic Applications","bibo:abstract":"The overall intention is to use a source of black-body radiation, perhaps some object being heated inside by burning fuel, to produce electricity from a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell by the correct sort of radiation arriving at the cell. Only light below a certain wavelength λ_g will generate a voltage in the cell; such high-frequency radiation may be termed “useful” in contrast to the “useless” lower-frequency radiation. To increase efficiency, ideally the otherwise useless long-wavelength light is returned to the radiator by reflecting back from the TPV cell.\r\n\r\nA key part of the device currently under investigation is an “interference filter”. This consists of a large number (say around 60) of thin layers (the whole device is about 2 μm thick) with differing refractive indices. The combination of multiple reflections and refractions, with associated change of phase, results in interference so that light of certain frequencies is mostly reflected back while other light is mostly transmitted through to the other side of the filter. In the ideal case, all the good frequencies will pass through the filter to the TPV cell lying behind it while the bad ones are reflected away:\r\n- overall reflection coefficient (by power) \u003d 1 for λ \u003c λ_g , 0 for λ \u003e λ_g ;\r\n- overall transmission coefficient (by power) \u003d 0 for λ \u003c λg , 1 for λ \u003e λg .\r\nUnfortunately, because of the effect of direction on optical lengths and hence on the level of interference, the transmission and reflection coefficients depend strongly upon the angle of incidence. For black-body radiation the dependence of the normal component of power upon the angle of incidence α exhibits a maximum at α \u003d π/4, although, of course, the power density (with respect to angle) is positive for all 0 \u003c α \u003c π/2. This means that – assuming that black-body radiation is impinging on the TPV cell – it makes sense to try to optimize the filter’s performance for α \u003d π/4, but then most radiation will be incident along sub-optimal directions. Indeed, because the optical lengths inside the filter are essentially given by cos α (or sec α), the effectivenesss of the filter depends least strongly upon angle for α near 0 (normal incidence). For this reason attention must also be focused on trying to direct the light from the radiator. With light travelling in (roughly) one direction, it is then possible to orient the cells so that light falls on them normally and the interference filters should be designed to work optimally with α \u003d 0 (or small).\r\n\r\nA second design improvement is also worthy of mention. It was raised during our deliberations, but constraints on time prevented us from further examining this research topic. The black-body radiation spectrum is not immutable; it is modified by using a multiple dielectric layer design for the emitter. This has the advantage of controlling both the angular emission pattern and the emission spectrum.","bibo:AuthorList":["Borne, Thomas","Cross, Danielle","Du, Gang","Edwards, David A.","Haus, Joe","King, John","Lacey, Andrew","Monk, Peter","Please, Colin","Tran, Hoa"],"dc:date":"1999","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"C M Cornelius and J P Dowling.

An everyday example is an air hockey table, where a puck is levitated above the table by an array of vertical jets of air. Using pressurized bearings there is no contact between “moving parts” and hence there is no friction and no wear of sensitive components.\r\n\r\nThis workshop project is focused on the problem of designing optimal static air bearings subject to given engineering constraints. Recent numerical computations of this problem, done at IBM by Robert and Hendriks, suggest that near-optimal designs can have unexpected complicated and intricate structures. We will use analytical approaches to shed some light on this situation and to offer some guides for the design process.\r\n\r\nIn Section 2 the design problem is stated and formulated as an optimization problem for an elliptic boundary value problem.\r\nIn Section 3 the general problem is specialized to bearings with rectangular bases.\r\nSection 4 addresses the solutions of this problem that can be obtained using variational formulations of the problem.\r\nAnalysis showing the sensitive dependence to perturbations (in numerical computations or manufacturing constraints) of near-optimal designs is given in Section 5.\r\nIn Section 6, a restricted class of “groove network” designs motivated by the original results of Robert and Hendriks is examined.\r\nFinally, in Section 7, we consider the design problem for circular axisymmetric air bearings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Howell, Peter","Kedzior, M.","Kramer, P.","Please, Colin","Rossi, Louis","Saintval, W.","Salazar, D.","Witelski, T."],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Cherkaev.

Such thin fibers are obtained by rapidly pulling molten glass through an array of successively smaller holes.\r\n\r\nThrough asymptotic analysis and physical modeling, we obtain a quantitative description of the flow and structure of the glass fiber as it is being pulled. We examine in particular the issue of whether initially planar cross sections remain planar, and find that they do so approximately, but not exactly, even in the absence of such factors as gravity, surface tension, and inertia. We also develop a quantitative theory for the structure of the air flow near the fiber, which is an important ingredient in determining how fast the fiber cools. In particular, we develop a description for the structure of the boundary layer near a fiber which has accelerating surface velocity and shrinking radius which is comparable or thin compared with the thickness of the boundary layer. One novel feature is that the acceleration of the fiber surface velocity leads to a compression of the boundary layer as it evolves downstream.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ambrose, David","Braun, Richard","DeBisschop, Cynthia","Gremaud, Pierre","Howell, Peter","Kramer, Peter","Please, Colin","Salazar Gonzalez, Jose Domingo","Schwendeman, Donald"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"C-H Chen.

These include the finite supply of oil, growing and shifting demand, the viability of alternative energy sources (at different pricing levels) and the interactions of oil producers and oil consumers, as they respond to current pricing levels.\r\n\r\nThe study group concluded that while ‘prediction’ of price in any meaningful sense was not viable, a model for scenario analysis could be realised. The model did not incorporate all of the factors of interest, but did model important time lags in the response of market players’ future behaviour to current oil prices. Consideration of the optimisation of supply through new capacity in the telecoms industry led to a generalisation of the standard Cournot-Nash equilibrium. This indicates how an output-constrained competitive market might operate. It enables identification of different pricing regimes determined by the level of competition and the resource limitations of particular supplier firms. Two models were developed sufficiently to enable simulation of various conditions and events. The first modelled oil price as a mean reverting Brownian motion process. Strategies and scenarios were included in the model and realistic simulations were produced. The second approach used stability analysis of an appropriate time-delayed differential equation. This enabled the identification of unstable conditions and the realisation of price oscillations which depended on the demand scenarios.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Marvin","Barton, David","Hall, Cameron","Coskun, Erhan","Lacey, Andrew","Lorenz, Maike","Maringer, Johannes","Please, Colin","Richardson, Giles"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Wajid Rasheed.

In order to do this, some estimate needs to be made of the volatility or uncertainty in the property assets, in order to use that in the same way as the volatilities of equities and bonds are used in the allocation. However, property assets are only valued monthly or quarterly (and are sold only rarely) whereas equities and bonds are priced continuously and recorded daily.\r\n\r\nCurrently many actuaries may assume that the volatility of property assets is between those of equities and bonds, but without quantifying it from real data. The challenge for the Study Group is to produce a model for estimating the volatility or uncertainty in property asset values, for use in portfolio planning. The Study Group examined contexts for the use of volatility estimates, particularly in relation to solvency calculations as required by the Financial Services Authority, fund trustees and corporate boards, and it proposed a number of possible approaches. This report summarises that work, and it suggests directions for further investigation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dewynne, Jeff","Fischer, Tom","Howison, Sam","Kulesza, Kamil","Lacey, Andrew","Piwarska, Karina","Wilkie, David","Zyskin, Maxim","MacDonald, Angus"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Booth and G Mercato.

The spindle must operate with great precision and stability at high rotational speeds. Design practice has converged on oil-lubricated hydrodynamic journal bearings as the most common choice for spindles. That is, a layer of viscous oil separates a rotating shaft (the bearing) from the fixed outer sleeve (the journal). In hard drives, it is very important for the shaft to be centered within the sleeve. Plain journal bearings (i.e. both surfaces are circular cylinders) are unstable to perturbations that push the shaft off-center. It was found that this stability problem can be overcome by cutting diagonal grooves into the journal in a pattern called a herring-bone. Another consequence of this design is that very high pressures are generated by the grooves as they drive the oil to the middle of the bearing, away from the top/bottom ends of the spindle. This pumping action generally works to oppose leakage out of the bearing.\r\n\r\nWe examine how choices for the groove pattern can influence the key properties of the bearing. The focus is to understand the effect of the groove geometry on the pumping action. In particular the undesirable behavior caused by the low pressures created near the top/bottom ends of the bearing which, under many conditions, may result in the pressure becoming negative, relative to atmospheric pressure. Negative pressure can result in cavitation or, when it occurs near an air-oil interface, can cause air to be ingested and hence create bubbles. Any bubbles in the oil can corrupt the lubricating layer in the bearing and, as they are created and collapse, can cause significant undesirable vibrations. The negative pressures have therefore been identified as one of the key problems in design of hard disk drive bearings.\r\n\r\nWe will use numerical computations and some analysis to show that by modifying the groove geometry we can reduce the negative pressure while retaining good stability characteristics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Maki, Kara","Ozlem, Melih","Schwendeman, Don","Please, Colin","Phillips, Joel","Case, Michael","Heryudono, Alfa","Bhalezcio, Kishor","Atena, Agegnehu","Witelski , Tom","Sun, Jiguang","Fehribach, Joseph"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Asada, H Saito, Y Asaida and K Itoh.

A voltage potential is applied across the fuse, in order to achieve a blow. This current peaks with a short pulse in the order of tens of milliamps which has a long decrease to zero current flow, resulting in a blown fuse. A fuse blows due to the pinching together of electrically insulating material which initially surrounds the conducting pathway. The pinch cuts across the conductor, and so halts the current flow. In small-geometry fuses a cavity also forms during the blowing process.\n\nThe company wishes to understand the fuse blow process mathematically in order to develop a model that can accurately simulate the blowing of the fuses.

It involves numerous interacting compounds and, crucially, light. The understanding of the complex regulation processes involved has been the focus of extensive experimental research providing a large source of data. A particular set of data, concerned with the modelling described in this report, involves 24 hour timecourse data from seedlings exposed to constant light, following a three day period of growth from seed in darkness. This data includes the levels of key components such as chlorophyll, ATP, chlorophyllide and proto-chlorophyllide. Amongst the questions posed in the study-group were: i) Can the timecourse data be predicted by a model? ii) Can it predict the dierences in levels of various components in found mutant strains.\n\nTo address these questions, we present in this report a model consisting of a coupled system of nonlinear ODEs that describes a simplied version of the tetrapyrrole pathway based on mass action laws. Model simulations produced results that agree qualitatively well with most, but not all, of the available timecourse data obtained from wild-type and mutant strains. Nearly all of the model\u0027s parameters are not known, so the values used in these simulations are based on estimates of the relative timescales of the reactions. An attempt at improving these estimates using data tting techniques is also discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ward, John","Moulin, Michael","Feugier, Francois","Hazledine, Saul"],"dc:date":"2007-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"B Schmid.

Here we report the use of a simple PCR with fluorescently-labelled primers to amplify inter-SSR markers (ISSRs) for diversity assessments. The use of ISSR markers does not rely upon specific genetic sequence information, or prolonged method development and may be measured rapidly using the automated equipment. The major restriction of the ISSR method is at the analysis stage, as the markers are dominant it is not possible to distinguish heterozygotes as loci. We obtained ISSR data from ca. 60 phenotypically characterised Capsella bursa pastoris L. Medic (shepherds purse)accessions that had been isolated from a diverse mix of arable field sites throughout the UK. We developed mathematical scripts for use with the free statistical software tool R (http://www.rproject.org/), that processed the molecular data in a binary format to estimate genetic diversity (using the Jaccard co-efficient), and that related genotype to the plant phenotypic and environmental (site specific) traits. The methodology established has the power to predict the relationship between environmental and plant morphological characteristics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Iannetta, Pietro"],"dc:date":"2007-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Diaz and M Cabido.

The field has matured to a stage where most of the key genes are known, and competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain how hormone balance works in seeds. During the meeting we simplified a more complex model of seed germination (Figure 1), reducing it to a tractable network. We then showed that if considered as a set of competing protein complexes the network took on the properties of a switch. Results from two models of the reduced network, which incorporated the biological switching phenomena, were found to be in good agreement with both wild and mutant phenotypic data. Our models made the novel prediction that one complex in particular was key to promoting germination, and this prediction can now\nbe tested in the laboratory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Penfield, Steven","Fozard, John"],"dc:date":"2007-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Kurup, Jones HD and Holdsworth MJ.

To this end the strategy adopted by Genus is to identify factors (auxiliary information about the stock such as earnings-to-price ratio or dividend yield) that they believe are associated with future out-performance (i.e. factors that have predictive ability). The best of these factors are then combined (Genus use a weighted average) into a model which is used to rank the universe of stocks month-by-month. This ranking is then used to as the input to a trading strategy, resulting in a modified portfolio.\n\nGenus had provided us with sample data, consisting of just over 12 years worth of monthly returns on a universe of 60 stocks, along with time series of 34 factors for each of the stocks. Using these data, the approach was to build software (MATLAB) models for:\n\n1. ranking the stocks based on factor information;\n\n2. implementing a trading strategy based on a stock ranking and assessing the performance of a given trading strategy by looking at measures such as hit ratio, information ratio and spread.\n\nThe IPSW team implemented a simplified trading strategy of selling the entire portfolio each month, and using the proceeds to invest equally in the top 20% of stocks as given by the computed ranking.

The essence of the problem was to understand how the S-transform could be used to create better seismic images, that would be useful in identifying possible hydrocarbon reservoirs in the earth.\n\nThe important first step was to understand what aspect of the imaging problem we were being asked to study. However, since we would not be working directly with raw seismic data, traditional seismic techniques would not be required. Rather, we would be working with a two dimensional image, either a migrated image, a common mid-point (CMP) stack, or a common depth point (CDP) stack. In all cases, the images display the subsurface of the earth with geological structures evident in various layers.\n\nFor a given image the local spectrum is computed at each point. The various peaks in the spectrum are used to classify each pixel in the original seismic image resulting in an enhanced and hopefully more useful seismic pseudosection. Thus, the objective of this project was to improve the identification of layers and other geological structures apparent in the two dimensional image (a seismic section, or CDP gather) by classifying and coloring image pixels into groups based on their local spectral attributes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lamoureux, Michael"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K Aki and P G Richards.

By doing so, the AFTS can serve as a system for the functional testing of different footwear designs in a manner that is difficult to achieve by standard testing systems. The AFTS consists of four main components: a robotic Stewart platform, a rigid fixed frame, a load cell and a prosthetic foot. Motion of the foot relative to the ground is created by rigidly fixing the foot to the frame and moving the platform relative to the foot. The Stewart platform has six degrees of kinematic freedom and can reproduce the required complex three-dimensional motion path within the limitations of its range of motion. While the platform is in contact with the footwear, the six-axis load cell measures the three-dimensional forces and moments acting on the prosthetic foot.\n\nFor the AFTS, a movement path is specified, translated into platform coordinates and executed on the machine. During the execution, the load cell measures the forces and moments that act on the prosthetic foot. We wish to find the particular movement path of the Stewart platform that will generate the target force profile. Thus, we are interested in solving an inverse problem. The main goal of the workshop was to investigate potential solution methods for this ‘force-control’ problem, including looking into its feasibility.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lewis, Greg"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.448699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710068,"sim:weight":0.447495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890329,"sim:weight":0.440329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68143,"sim:weight":0.436431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.435737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101261,"sim:weight":0.430087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43103,"sim:weight":0.428118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710084,"sim:weight":0.416354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710696,"sim:weight":0.41583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.4089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.402857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26442,"sim:weight":0.382092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269933,"sim:weight":0.380061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664565,"sim:weight":0.376912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890288,"sim:weight":0.376663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43385,"sim:weight":0.374117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71065,"sim:weight":0.366593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147453,"sim:weight":0.366575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46878,"sim:weight":0.359995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.359556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We begin with a survey of physical data for both bipedal and quadrupedal dinosaurs. The ratio of the tail to leg length is compared across many diverse species and a scaling law is developed that relates the tail length, leg length and tail radius. A continuous model for the tail is then developed, and by nondimensionalising a small parameter related to the thinness of the tail simplifies the resulting coupled nonlinear equations. It is shown that the resulting set of equations contain aspects of both beam dynamics and wave propagation.  Finally, a discrete version of the tail is derived with the assumption that the sections of the tail are coupled with a stiff joint that allows rotation but does not allow extension. In this model the stiffness of each joint is characterized by an effective spring constant $k_i$ for the $i$th joint and results in a discrete version of the Euler-Bernoulli expression for each of the tail segments. The paper finishes with some preliminary conclusions and directions for future work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bohun, C.

Their collection of information consists of both demographic and expenditure variables which are expressed through thousands of individually tracked factors. This large  collection of information about consumer behaviour is typically referred to as a mine. Although very large in practice, for the purposes of this report, the data mine consisted of $m$ individuals and $n$ factors where $m \\sim 2000$ and $n \\sim 50$ . Ideally, the first algorithm would identify a few factors in the data mine which would differentiate customers in terms of a particular product preference. Then the second algorithm would build on this information by looking for patterns in the data mine which would identify related areas of consumer spending.\n\nTo test the algorithms two case studies were undertaken. The first study involved differentiating BMW and Honda car owners. The algorithms developed were reasonably successful at both finding questions that differentiate these two populations and identifying common characteristics amongst the groups of respondents. For the second case study it was hoped that the same algorithms could differentiate between consumers of two brands of beer. In this case the first algorithm was not as successful as differentiating between all groups; it showed some distinctions between beer drinkers and non-beer drinkers, but not as clearly defined as in the first case study. The second algorithm was then used successfully to further identify spending patterns once this distinction was made. In this second case study a deeper factor analysis could be used to identify a combination of factors which could be used in the first algorithm.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bohun, C.

While it has become common to model a single stock using the Black-Scholes formulation, the modelling of bond prices requires one to simulate the change of interest rates as a function of their maturity, which requires one to model the movement of an entire yield curve. If one studies the spectral decomposition of the correlation matrix corresponding to the spot rates from this curve, then one finds that the top three components can explain nearly all of the data; in addition, this same structure is observed for any bond or commodity. In his 2000 paper, Ilias Lekkos [4] proposes that such results are an artefact due to the implicit correlation between spot rates, and that the analysis should instead be performed using forward rates. In this paper, we discuss the results obtained for the spectral structure of the correlation matrices of forward rates, and investigate a model for this associated structure. The paper is divided into four parts, covering forward rates background material, principal components analysis, yield curve modelling, and conclusions and research extensions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee, Seung Youn"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L Forzani and C Tolmasky.

To make this possible, Orisar Inc. (formerly Semiconductor Insights) provides reverse engineering services to integrated circuit (IC) manufacturers. The process produces a circuit diagram from a chip and allows the manufacturer to learn about a competitor’s product. These services are also used to determine if any intellectual property infringements have been committed by their competitor.\n\nReverse engineering of integrated circuit is made difficult by the shrinking form factor and increasing transistor density. To perform this complex task Orisar Inc. employs sophisticated techniques to capture the design of an IC. Electron microscope photography captures a detailed image of an IC layer. Because a typical IC contains more than one layer, each layer is photographed and physically removed from the IC to expose the next layer. A noise removal algorithm is then applied to the pictures, which are then passed to pattern recognition software in order to transfer the layer design into a polygonal\nrepresentation of the circuit. At the last step a knowledgeable human expert looks at the polygonal representation and inputs the design into a standard electronic schematic with a CAD package.\n\nThis process us currently very time consuming. We propose a method which can be easily automated thereby saving valuable worker time and accelerating the process of reverse engineering.","bibo:AuthorList":["Santosa, Fadil"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Thomas H Cormen, Charles E Leiserson and Ronald L Rivest.

Ideally, a generalization of the recursive Bayes non-linear filter would track and resolve the state(s) of single or multiple targets, but that is currently computationally intractable. The Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) makes the tracking problem computationally feasible by propagating only the first-order multi-target statistical moments by using a particle filter implementation for the PHD. The problem then becomes one of estimating the targets’ state based on the output of the PHD when using a particle filter implementation. \n\nThis paper describes one heuristic method for obtaining a state estimator from the PHD. The approach used in this paper, based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, views the PHD distribution as a mixture distribution, and the particles as an i.i.d. sampling from the mixture distribution. Using this, a maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters of the distribution can be generated. The EM seems to work fairly well, particularly when targets are well spaced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yewchuk, Kerianne","Ketelsen, Christian","Limon, Alfonso","Mileyko, Yuryi"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"RONALD MAHLER.

{"identifier":15933,"ep:Repository":70,"dc:type":["Study Group Report","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"In-Situ Thermal Remediation of Contaminated Soil","bibo:abstract":"Recently, a method for removing contaminants from soil (several meters under the ground) has been proposed by McMillan-McGee Corp. The process can be described as follows. Over a period of several weeks, electrical energy is introduced to the contaminated soil using a multitude of finite length cylindrical electrodes. Current is forced to flow through the soil by the voltage differentials at the electrodes. Water is also pumped into the soil via the injection well and out of the ground at the extraction well. The soil is heated up by the electrical current and the contaminated liquids and vapours are produced at the extraction well. The temperature of the contaminated soil, during the process, is believed to reach the maximum value (the boiling temperature of water). Normally, the electrodes are placed around the contaminated site and the extraction well is located in the centre of the contaminated region. The distance between the electrodes is usually seven to eight meters. The distance between the extraction well and an electrode is about four meters. The diameter of the electrodes is 0.2 meter and the extraction well is 0.1 meter in diameter.\n\nThe reason for using the electrical current is that “flushing” the soil using water alone is not effective for removing the contaminants. By heating up the soil and vaporizing the contaminated liquid, it is anticipated that rate of extraction will increase as long as the recondensation is not significant. A major concern, therefore, is whether recondensation will occur. Intuitively, one might speculate that liquid phase may dominate near the injection well. Moving away from the injection site towards the extraction well, due to the combined effects of lower pressure and higher temperature (from heating), phase change occurs and a mixture of vapour and liquid may co-exist. There may also be a vapour-only region, depending on the values of temperature, pressure, and other parameters. In the two-phase zone, since vapour bubbles tend to rise due to the buoyancy force, and the temperature decreases along the vertical path of the bubbles out of the heated region, it is possible that the bubbles will recondense before reaching the extraction well. As a consequence, the probability exists that part of the contaminants stay in the soil. Obviously, to predict transition between single-phase and two-phase regions and to understand the transport phenomenon in detail, a thermal capillary two-phase flow model is needed. However, to simplify the problem, here we only consider the case when two-phases co-exist in the entire region.","bibo:AuthorList":["Huang, Huaxiong","Lapin, Serguei","Westbrook, Rex"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Q C Bi and T S Zhao.

These services include both exploration and production tools ranging through seismic and remote sensing, well-logging and reservoir optimization. The problem described in this report is related to well-logging via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), a relatively new and developing tool with potential to reveal a range of reservoir properties including porosity and saturation, as well as physical properties of the petroleum deposit.\n\nIn order to recover this information from NMR spectra the company must have an effective, efficient and robust algorithm to perform inversion from the dataset to the unknown probability distribution on magnetic relaxation times. This ill-posed problem is encountered in diverse areas of magnetic imaging and there does not appear to be an ‘off-the-shelf’ solution which the company can apply to its problem. Company scientists have developed a sophisticated algorithm which  performs well on some simple test datasets, but they are interested in knowing if there are simpler approaches which could work effectively, or if some limited but useful properties of the density are accessible with a totally different approach.\n\nOur report is organised as follows. In Section 1.2 we present a careful and complete description of the problem and the work already done by the company. In Section 1.3 we discuss Truncated Singular Value Regularisation and Tikhonov Regularisation and show how some ‘off-the-shelf’ Matlab code may be used to good effect on the test datasets provided by the company. In Section 1.4 we show that one can incorporate higher order regularisation into the company’s existing algorithm, answering one specific question raised at the beginning of the workshop. Finally, in Section 1.5 we record our unsuccessful attempt to establish an iterative algorithm for the positively constrained inversion. Finally in the last section we review our conclusions and make suggestions for future work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bose, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J P Butler, J A Reeds and S V Dawson.

Seismic imaging can be used to reconstruct a profile of the material properties of the earth below the surface, and is thus widely used for locating hydrocarbons.\n\nThe problem presented by Husky Energy concerns seismic attenuation: the loss of energy as a seismic wave propagates through the earth. As an exploration tool, attenuation effects have only recently attracted attention. These effects can prove useful in two ways: as a means of correcting seismic data to enhance resolution of standard imaging techniques, and as a direct hydrocarbon indicator. Theoretically, a subsurface reservoir full of hydrocarbons will tend to be acoustically softer than a porous rock filled only with water; Kumar et al show that attenuation is highest in a partially fluid-saturated rock.\n\nMany physical processes can lead to the attenuation of a seismic trace. In the present work, we ignore attenuation effects such as spherical divergence or scattering, and concentrate on intrinsic attenuation effects exclusively. The latter are caused by friction, particularly in porous rocks between fluid and solid particles.\n\nThe goal of the workshop was to find a means of computing seismic attenuation from relatively short windows of seismic imaging data, and particularly be able to identify regions of anomalous attenuation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nigam, Nilima"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K Mewhort Hedlin, L and G Margrave.

The impact is modelled using a mass-spring system, where the force of impact is obtained for a given impact velocity, system mass and pre-calculated “spring” constants for the impacting bodies. In order to determine the importance of the presence of the hydraulic fluid, the compressibility of the molten metal, and the leakage past the screw tip, we will assume that the deformation of the piston and housing can be ignored. However, in order to make quantitative predictions of the impact forces, it is necessary to include the effects due to the compressibility\nof the machine parts.

The idea is basically to determine the effects of placements for various layers built up in the construction of a tire, to allow the design of a smooth tire with a smooth ride. A highly success solution was developed, and it has been reported that this method introduced savings of over half a million dollars in their test processes. This year, Michelin returned to the workshop with an extension to the original problem, to address specific refinements in the testing method. This report summarizes the work completed in course of the five day workshop.\n\nIt was clear early in the workshop that this problem could be handled quickly by reviewing the analysis which was done in 2000, and extending those ideas to the new problems at hand. We reviewed the required Fourier techniques to describe the harmonic problem, and statistical techniques to deal with the linear model that described how to accurately measure quantities that come from real experimental measurements. The “prime method” and “good lattice points method” were reviewed and re-analysed so we could understand (and prove) why they work so well. We then looked at extending these methods and successfully found solutions to problem 1) and 2) posed by Michelin. Matlab code was written to test and verify the algorithms developed. We have some ideas on problems 3) and 4), which are also described.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lamoureux, Michael"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K T Fang and Y Wang. (1994).

At any given time the potential $V$ satisfies the equation $\\nabla \\cdot (\\sigma \\nabla V ) \u003d 0$. Time enters the equation only as a  parameter since $\\sigma$ is temperature and hence time dependent.\n\nThe problem of finding $\\sigma$ when both the potential $V$ and the current density $\\sigma \\partial{V} / \\partial{n}$ are known on the boundary of the domain is a standard inverse problem of long standing. It is known that the problem is ill posed and hence that an accurate numerical solution will be difficult especially when the input data is subject to measurement errors.\n\nIn this report we examine a possible method for solving the electrical inverse problem which could possibly be used in a time stepping algorithm when the conductivity changes little in each step.\n\nSince we are also able to make temperature measurements there is also the possibility of examining an inverse problem for the temperature equation. There seems to be much less literature on this problem, which in our case is essentially, a first order equation with a heat source.(We neglect thermal  conductivity, which is small compared with the convection). Combining the results of both inverse problems might give a more robust method of estimating the temperature in the soil.","bibo:AuthorList":["Westbrook, Rex","Bohun, Sean C."],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Cheney, D Isaacson and J C Newell.

These assets represent credit granted to obligors as well as investments in securities. A common size for such a portfolio lies from anywhere between 400 to 10,000 instruments.\n\nThe essential goal of the credit institution is to minimize their losses due to default. By default we mean any event causing an asset to stop producing income. This can be the closure of a stock as well as the inability of an obligor to pay their debt, or even an obligor\u0027s decision to pay out all his debt.\n\nMinimizing the combined losses of a credit portfolio is not a deterministic problem with one clean solution. The large number of factors influencing each obligor, different market sectors, their interactions and trends, etc. are more commonly dealt with in terms of statistical measures. Such include the expectation of return and the volatility of each asset associated with a given time horizon.\n\nIn this sense, we consider in the following the expected loss and risk associated with the assets in a credit portfolio over a given time horizon of (typically) 10 to 30 years. We use a Monte Carlo approach to simulate the loss of a portfolio in multiple scenarios, which leads to a distribution function for the expected loss of the portfolio over that time horizon. Second, we compare the results of the simulation to a Gaussian approximation obtained via the Lindeberg-Feller Theorem. Consistent with our expectations, the Gaussian approximation compares well with a Monte Carlo simulation in case of a portfolio of very risky assets.\n\nUsing a model which produces a distribution of expected losses allows credit institutions to estimate their maximum expected loss with a certain confidence interval. This in turn helps in taking important decisions about whether to grant credit to an obligor, to exercise options or otherwise take advantage of sophisticated securities to minimize losses. Ultimately, this leads to the process of credit risk management.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kane, Selly","Krupp, Viktoria","Macki, Jack"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R C Merton.

Developed in 1916 by Jan Czochralski as a method of producing crystals of rare metals, this method is now used to produce most of the semiconductor wafers in the electronics industry.\n\nMany aspects of this process have been investigated to gain a greater insight of the physical processes involved. We begin with the heat problem, first as a one dimensional model, then extending to a second dimension. This analysis indicates\nthat the temperature of the gas surrounding the crystal has a major impact on both the thermal stress experienced by the crystal and the shape of the crystal/melt interface. In contrast,variations in the heat \nflux from the melt have much less of an effect.\n\nHaving investigated the temperature profiles, the analysis then focuses on the behaviour of the fluid. Scaling arguments are used to estimate the thickness of the various boundary layers and explain the main flow patterns that are experimentally observed.\n\nNext, the shape of the meniscus is determined for various rotation rates. This analysis shows that the shape of the meniscus is relatively invariant at least at low rotation rates yet the actual vertical position of the meniscus changes readily with the rate of rotation.\n\nAfter analyzing the fluid flow patterns, a model is developed for the height of the melt as a function of time. This indicates that for a crystal of constant radius the proportion of the effective pull rate due to the falling fluid level remains essentially constant over the complete growing time of the crystal. This no longer remains true if the radius of the crystal is allowed to increase at a constant rate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bohun, Sean C."],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Y Wang, L L Regel and W R Wilcox.

For most computer users the logs of one day compared to the next may be very similar. For example, opening up a commonly used program may require access to the same files in the same order every time that event occurs. We shall call such a sequence of files a trace.\n\nThe essence of the problem therefore is: given a set of traces that are expected to be representative of common use, we must rearrange the files on the disk so that the performance is optimized.\n\nPrograms called disk defragmenters use these simple principles to rearrange data records on a disk so that each file is contiguous, with no holes or few holes between data records. Some more sophisticated disk defragmenters also try to place related files near each other, usually based on simple static structure rather than a dynamic analysis of the accesses. We are interested in more dynamic defragmentation procedures.\n\nWe first consider a 1D model of the disk. We then look at the results from an investigation of the 2D disk model followed by a discussion of caching strategies. Finally we list some of the complications that may need to be addressed in order to make the models more realistic.","bibo:AuthorList":["Neudauer, Nancy Ann"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.312059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2111921,"sim:weight":0.308513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.307043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45738,"sim:weight":0.306956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.270404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.270404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.270404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.270404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.270404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.270404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.270404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.270404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.270404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.270404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.270404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.270404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.270404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.270404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.269747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43103,"sim:weight":0.263271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Results for a test case are presented.","bibo:AuthorList":["Huang, Huaxiong"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15975,"sim:weight":0.392026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145423,"sim:weight":0.33441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43121,"sim:weight":0.333049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108124,"sim:weight":0.331726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43126,"sim:weight":0.327379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43122,"sim:weight":0.323581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43993,"sim:weight":0.319449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43130,"sim:weight":0.315361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77805,"sim:weight":0.298273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101644,"sim:weight":0.290056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43108,"sim:weight":0.280071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43124,"sim:weight":0.279431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43107,"sim:weight":0.275528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88784,"sim:weight":0.273921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43119,"sim:weight":0.273283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98509,"sim:weight":0.272271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43123,"sim:weight":0.270566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98506,"sim:weight":0.26811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102022,"sim:weight":0.259131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394133,"sim:weight":0.257575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, in the turbulent case, as gravity drives the denser fluid into the less dense one the invading fluid is immediately mixed by turbulent diffusion. This means that sharp interfaces do not exist. Instead there will be a finite mixing region where the volume fraction of each fluid changes from $0$ to $1$. In this case $D$ will depend upon the relative concentration of the fluids.

{"identifier":15995,"ep:Repository":70,"dc:type":["Study Group Report","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Spot-on: Safe Fuel/Air Compression","bibo:abstract":"The emission of fuel vapors into the atmosphere from underground storage tanks at filling stations is a common occurrence in many parts the world. The conditions of the vapor in the tanks vary significantly over a 24 hour period such that evaporation and excess air ingestion during the refueling process can cause tank over pressurization and subsequent emissions. At other times during a 24 hour cycle, pressures can fall below atmospheric pressure. The state of California has recognized this emissions problem and has enacted regulations to address it.\nDue to these low-emission environmental requirements in California, solutions must be implemented that do not entail release of these vapors into the atmosphere. One solution requires that the vapors fill a balloon during the appropriate times. However, the size of the balloon at typical inflation rates requires a significant amount of physical space (approximately 1000-2000 liters), which may not necessarily be available at filling stations in urban areas. Veeder-Root has a patent pending for a system to compress the vapors that are released to a 10:1 ratio, store this compressed vapor in a small storage tank, and then return the vapors to the original underground fuel tank when the conditions are thermodynamically appropriate (see Figure 1 for the schematic representation of this system).\nThe limitation of the compressor, however, is that the compression phase must take place below the ignition temperature of the vapor. For a 10:1 compression ratio, however, the adiabatic temperature rise of a vapor would be above the ignition temperature. Mathematical modeling is necessary here to estimate the\nperformance of the compressor, and to suggest paths in design for improvement.\nThis report starts with a mathematical formulation of an ideal compressor, and uses the anticipated geometry of the compressor to state a simplified set of partial differential equations. The adiabatic case is then considered, assuming that the temporary storage tank is kept at a constant temperature. Next, the\nheat transfer from the compression chamber through the compressor walls is incorporated into the model.\nFinally, we consider the case near the valve wall, which is subject to the maximum temperature rise over the estimated 10,000 cycles that will be necessary for the process to occur. We find that for adiabatic conditions, there is a hot spot close to the wall where the vapor temperature can exceed the wall temperature. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our analysis, and its limitations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Banks, Jeffrey","Fehribach, Joseph","Fitt, Alistair","Hart, Robert","Hughes, Kevin","Ockendon, John","Please, Colin","Schwendeman, Don","Tilley, Burt","Weekes, Suzanne"],"dc:date":"2003-12-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931561,"sim:weight":0.409768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28024,"sim:weight":0.398955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383230,"sim:weight":0.390334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17994,"sim:weight":0.387104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46943,"sim:weight":0.379999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99369,"sim:weight":0.345812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108096,"sim:weight":0.327776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85046,"sim:weight":0.322887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269909,"sim:weight":0.316517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.314165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385947,"sim:weight":0.313142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43828,"sim:weight":0.303763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48331,"sim:weight":0.299976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387094,"sim:weight":0.298469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101292,"sim:weight":0.298101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.297729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43570,"sim:weight":0.296299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.294247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145764,"sim:weight":0.28252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68067,"sim:weight":0.27857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Two models are studied. One is the evolution of the states of individuals on hypothesized social structures from a rewired connected caveman model. This model spans a range of social structures (networks) from very ordered to effectively random with small world structures in between. The second model is a zip-code-level model which uses data from a recent survey in Delaware. The model is a discrete model using 10 zip codes. The results show that the evolution of alcohol dependence, as governed by the simple rules that we use, depends sensitively on the network structure and a hypothetical treatment regime.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buchanan, J.R.","Gleeson, J.","Braun, R."],"dc:date":"2004-11-05","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M E J Newman.

This regulation takes the form of a default tariff. Currently, IPART considers the NSLP of each standard retailer, and any projected future changes in these NSLPs, before setting tariff levels for default customers.\nIn the process of constructing the default tariff, IPART assumes that the cost of purchasing energy is equal for all retailers. IPART also makes no allowance for hedging costs, which will vary depending upon the NSLP of the electricity retailer. If one retailer has more NSLP volatility than other retailers, their hedging costs for default customers will increase. Under the current default tariff structure, these increased hedging costs become an unrecoverable expense.\nThe aim of this project is to explore the volatility of Integral Energy’s NSLP, relative to that of other retailers, with a view toward developing a risk multiplier that accurately and reliably quantifies the volatility differences between NSLPs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Russell, Ken","Cerone, Pietro","Challis, Vivien"],"dc:date":"2007-02-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":33748,"sim:weight":0.308776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102010,"sim:weight":0.303213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98522,"sim:weight":0.288699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30600,"sim:weight":0.276417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98508,"sim:weight":0.269562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98509,"sim:weight":0.268111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2015760,"sim:weight":0.257544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394133,"sim:weight":0.225827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43108,"sim:weight":0.219508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101644,"sim:weight":0.212315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767113,"sim:weight":0.172536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98528,"sim:weight":0.15481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2312085,"sim:weight":0.146998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2284290,"sim:weight":0.134236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708458,"sim:weight":0.130796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997548,"sim:weight":0.130753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929856,"sim:weight":0.120424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998226,"sim:weight":0.118825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997739,"sim:weight":0.112866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933921,"sim:weight":0.0945723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We describe a combination of stochastic, financial and simulation models to model the production of airplanes. A  preliminary simulation of the model is also presented.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gaur, Daya"],"dc:date":"1998-06-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":102010,"sim:weight":0.365551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49420,"sim:weight":0.347445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33748,"sim:weight":0.345747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98522,"sim:weight":0.331284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98517,"sim:weight":0.313175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77805,"sim:weight":0.283077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98509,"sim:weight":0.280597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30600,"sim:weight":0.271713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98508,"sim:weight":0.261049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55356,"sim:weight":0.257682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108124,"sim:weight":0.255498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145423,"sim:weight":0.232274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394133,"sim:weight":0.231557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101644,"sim:weight":0.213586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43122,"sim:weight":0.211233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43123,"sim:weight":0.209016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43126,"sim:weight":0.199131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43121,"sim:weight":0.192321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43108,"sim:weight":0.19071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98528,"sim:weight":0.173225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":16055,"ep:Repository":70,"dc:type":["Study Group Report","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Sensitivity of Markov chains for wireless\nprotocols","bibo:abstract":"Network communication protocols such as the IEEE 802.11 wireless protocol are currently best modelled as Markov chains. In these situations we have some protocol parameters $\\alpha$, and a transition matrix $P(\\alpha)$ from which we can compute the steady state (equilibrium) distribution $z(\\alpha)$ and hence final desired quantities $q(\\alpha)$, which might be for example the throughput of the protocol. Typically the chain will have thousands of states, and a particular example of interest is the Bianchi chain defined later. Generally we want to optimise $q$, perhaps subject to some constraints that also depend on the Markov chain. To do this efficiently we need the gradient of $q$ with respect to $\\alpha$, and therefore need the gradient of $z$ and other properties of the chain with respect to $\\alpha$. The matrix formulas available for this involve the so-called fundamental matrix, but are there approximate gradients available which are faster and still sufficiently accurate? In some cases BT would like to do the whole calculation in computer algebra, and get a series expansion of the equilibrium $z$ with respect to a parameter in $P$. In addition to the steady state $z$, the same questions arise for the mixing time and the mean hitting times. Two qualitative features that were brought to the Study Group’s attention were:\n\n    * the transition matrix $P$ is large, but sparse.\n    * the systems of linear equations to be solved are generally singular and need some additional normalisation condition, such as is provided by using the fundamental matrix. \n\nWe also note a third highly important property regarding applications of numerical linear algebra:\n\n    * the transition matrix $P$ is asymmetric. \n\nA realistic dimension for the matrix $P$ in the Bianchi model described below is 8064×8064, but on average there are only a few nonzero entries per column. Merely storing such a large matrix in dense form would require nearly 0.5GBytes using 64-bit floating point numbers, and computing its LU factorisation takes around 80 seconds on a modern microprocessor. It is thus highly desirable to employ specialised algorithms for sparse matrices. These algorithms are generally divided between those only applicable to symmetric matrices, the most prominent being the conjugate-gradient (CG) algorithm for solving linear equations, and those applicable to general matrices. A similar division is present in the literature on numerical eigenvalue problems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allwright, David","Dellar, Paul"],"dc:date":"2007-04-17","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Aldous and J A Fill.

It causes excessive wear on components and can cause accidents. The nose wheel is roughly like a caster on a shopping trolley: the horizontal axle of the wheel is mounted in an assembly that is free to rotate about a vertical axis. Shimmy is (or at least includes) oscillation of the wheel assembly about this vertical axis. The current engineering approach has little understanding of the physical mechanisms causing shimmy, but relies on the use of shimmy dampers, and on systematic maintenance and replacement of landing gear components. Simulations are carried out with finite element models and multi-body systems, and there are theoretical models due to Stépán and Somieski. In fact shimmy can also involve lateral oscillation of the landing gear (as well as torsional) and can be coupled to and caused by flutter of the airframe. The phenomenon is multi-scale in nature, as it can be linked to normal mechanical wear of key components at one scale, and gross flexibility effects at the vehicle scale. Airbus wish to identify it earlier in order to address passenger comfort, pilot comfort, manage mechanical wear and avoid overfatiguing the system elements. Specifically, Airbus wish to identify key system elements that may cause shimmy, when given a particular configuration of an aircraft. At early stages of development the configuration may involve the shape and size of the fuselage and design of the landing gear, whilst at the other end of the development process, the configuration may also consist of detailed system elements such as actuators, etc. Airbus relies on systematic maintenance and replacement of landing gear components, thereby avoiding the occurrences of the abovementioned phenomena.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barton, David","Wood, David"],"dc:date":"2007-04-17","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Landing Gear.

What kind of information and how exploitable it is are very relevant questions. Two approaches are being used. Either one concentrates on individual behaviour and tries to apply various theoretical frameworks and results of the literature on discrete choice, or one uses clustering algorithms in order to determine several classes of customers. The very existence of such categories is likely to be the result of social interactions and influences. The literature on discrete choice cannot easily be generalised to networked interactions, which are known to be widely present in various contexts. Another approach is to use toy models of individual behaviour and concentrate on global, aggregate quantities such as market share or demand fluctuations. This raises the question of how to validate such kind of model, hence the request of Unilever. The latter should also be understood with respect to the contribution of ESGI 2004, where a very sophisticated agent-based model of consumer behaviour was proposed (but not much studied).","bibo:AuthorList":["Challet, Damien","Krause, Andreas"],"dc:date":"2007-04-17","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Casas, S J Chapman, R Hunt, G Kozyreff, A Lacey, E Larrieu, R Leese, T Roose, D Schley and L Staron.

This allows the decision maker to investigate the impact of particular investment strategies over a period of years, the impact being measured in terms of “quality” or “capability”. Interventions can be designed so that “quality” (Q) is maximized at a particular time, or so that the average quality over a given time interval is maximized. Both of these approaches are explored. This model shows reasonable behaviour when tested over a parameter set.

Fuel is stored in large tanks (typically within the wing of the aircraft) which are approximately rectangular, but have detailed internal structure. A typical tank is illustrated in Figure 1, in which we can see the internal stringers and other small details.\n\nFigure 1: An example of a typical fuel tank showing the internal structures including corners and stringers.\n\nA key aspect of aircraft safety is an accurate measurement of the amount of fuel in the tank. To determine this, the height h of the fuel at certain points within the tank is measured and the fuel volume V is determined from this. However the relationship between height and volume depends crucially on the pitch angle, α, and roll angle, β, of the tank. (This is clear to all of us when we drive a car and see that the indicated fuel level in the tank depends upon whether we are going up or down hill at the time.) At present Airbus uses lookup tables to link height to volume for a set of pitch and roll angles. As the fuel tanks become more and more intricate, the huge amount of data required becomes an issue. The problem posed to the Study Group was whether the lookup tables can be replaced by suitable functions. (Note that we only considered the static problem, which assumed that the fuel was in equilibrium. The much harder problem of determining the volume of a sloshing fuel was not considered, but might make a very interesting problem for a future Study Group.)\n\nTo solve this problem we require a combination of numerical analysis and geometry. Numerical methods are needed to determine suitable approximations to the h-V function. However, generating such approximations turns out to be very subtle, because of the way that the fuel interacts with the tank geometry. This leads to h-V curves which are nonsmooth and have to be approximated very carefully. An understanding of the way that this nonsmoothness arises and how the resulting curves can be approximated forms the basis of this Study Group report.","bibo:AuthorList":["Budd, Chris"],"dc:date":"2007-04-17","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Boyd and L Vandenberghe.

{"identifier":16064,"ep:Repository":70,"dc:type":["Study Group Report","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Forecasting triads: the negative feedback problem","bibo:abstract":"At the end of the winter season (November 1st to February 28th), National Grid identifies the three half-hour periods of highest consumption of electricity, subject to a separation of at least 10 calendar days. These three periods are called Triads. Thus, the half-hour in which national demand was highest is the first Triad; the second highest half-hour, excluding a period of 21 days centred on the first Triad, is the second Triad; and the third highest half-hour, excluding two periods of 21 days centred on the first and second Triads, is the third Triad. Historically, Triads always occur on Mondays to Thursdays between 16:30 and 18:00 hours, and not close to Christmas (which is a period of relatively low consumption). Figure 1 shows the typical pattern over a winter.\n\nFigure 1: National electricity consumption figures from the winter of 2003/04. Diamonds indicate daily levels; squares indicate dates on which British Energy issued Triad warnings; and circles indicate those dates on which a Triad was, at the end of the winter, declared to have occurred.\n\nBritish Energy supplies electricity to large industrial and commercial customers. Charges are based on the Transmission Network Use of System (TNUoS) Charges which are levied by National Grid and passed through to British Energy’s customers. TNUoS includes a substantial surcharge based on each customer’s usage during the Triad periods: the higher a customer’s usage during Triads, the higher their overall electricity supply costs.\n\nBritish Energy, in common with other large commercial electricity suppliers, aims to reduce National Grid charges for some of its customers by issuing a “Triad warning” on days when it seems possible that a Triad might later be found to have occurred. Industrial customers are often encouraged by their contract with British Energy to reduce their consumption on those warning days. British Energy are restricted by the contract to issuing a limited number of calls over the entire winter period, anything up to 23.\n\nA customer who receives a Triad warning may, or may not, take action (e.g. shutting down their factory early that day). Some – but not all – customers are contractually required to inform British Energy whether or not they are reducing their consumption. Therefore British Energy cannot be sure by how much overall consumption will drop if a warning is issued. Furthermore, the national consumption is also affected by suppliers other than British Energy who may also have issued a Triad warning.\n\nIt is thought that this system may suffer from “negative feedback”. That is, on a day that is likely to include a Triad period because it has high predicted consumption, many suppliers will issue warnings, resulting in many customers reducing their actual consumption, ensuring that the total national demand is actually much lower than predicted: sufficiently low, in fact, that no Triad occurs, and no warning was actually necessary. It is expensive for customers to take action when it is not actually required.\n\nBritish Energy currently uses the deterministic half-hourly consumption forecast issued by National Grid and the recent and forecast temperatures at hourly intervals at 7 locations around the country to decide on a daily basis whether to issue a Triad warning. The decision-making tool, called TriFoS, does not currently take into account the possible problem of negative feedback.\n\nThe Study Group was asked to consider ways of compensating for negative feedback. Section 2 confirms that feedback is a statistically significant phenomenon. Sections 3 and 4 then use the so-called ‘Full-Information Secretary Problem’ to motivate the derivation of possible triad-calling strategies. Section 5 examines the possibilities for issuing triad warnings from analysing historical data.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hunt, Robert","Clarke, Liam","Byatt-Smith, John","Billingham, John"],"dc:date":"2007-04-13","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A T Benjamin and J J Quinn.

From a system point of view it is important to maintain a high throughput, that is, a high number of packets served per unit of time. However from a user point of view it is important to minimise the service time. This poses a trade-off problem, which is one of the goals we wish to analyse.\n\nThe wireless transmission channel alternates between good and bad states over time. While the channel is in a bad state the transmission of a packet fails and the packet needs to be retransmitted. When the state of the channel is good, packets are transmitted successfully and do not require retransmission. The system transmission efficiency or throughput might be defined as the number of data packets that can be transmitted successfully in a given time.\n\nThe scheduler we wish to study is designed to consider both the wireless channel conditions and the users\u0027 quality of service requirements. For this purpose users are assigned a credit every scheduling frame, which is a function of the wireless channel conditions and the quality of service required, which depends on the traffic class.","bibo:AuthorList":["Allwright, David","Armour, Tristram"],"dc:date":"2007-04-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108624,"sim:weight":0.410038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.351925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102618,"sim:weight":0.328948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.323024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101472,"sim:weight":0.316236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43308,"sim:weight":0.306451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.296318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101562,"sim:weight":0.28097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.280396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.280396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.280396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.280396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.280396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.280396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.280396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.280396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.280396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.280396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.280396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.280396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The transistors have to be placed without overlap into a prescribed configuration of blockades, i.e. parts of the chipthat are beforehand excluded from positioning by for example some other functional component, and holes, i.e. the remaining free area on the chip.  A method to minimize the wire length when the free area is a simply connected domain has already been implemented by Magma, but the placement problem becomes much more complex when the free area is not a simply connected domain anymore, forming  a ``holey cheese\u0027\u0027. One of the approaches of the problem in this case is to first cluster the transistors into so-called macro\u0027s in such a way that closely interconnected transistors stay together, and that the macro\u0027s can be fit into the holes. One way to carry out the clustering is to use a graph clustering algorithm, the so-called Markov Cluster algorithm. Another way is to combine the placement method of Magma on a rectangular area of the same size as the total size of the holes, and a min cut-max flow algorithm to divide that rectangle into more or less rectangular macro\u0027s in such a way that as little wires as possible are cut. \n\nIt is now possible to formulate the Quadratic Assignment Problem that remains after clustering the original problem to one with 100 up to 1000 macros. There exists a lot of literature on finding the global minimum of the costs, but nowadays computational possibilities are still too restrictive to find an optimal solution within a reasonable amount of time and computational memory. however, we believe it is possible to find a solution that leads to a acceptable local minimum of the costs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brouwer, Rachel","Brouwer, Thijs","Hurkens, Cor","van Manen, Martijn","Montijn, Carolynne","Schreuder, Jan","Williams, JF"],"dc:date":"2002-02-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43993,"sim:weight":0.83695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85152,"sim:weight":0.834669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997548,"sim:weight":0.81851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16089,"sim:weight":0.816264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16068,"sim:weight":0.81551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98506,"sim:weight":0.811708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88784,"sim:weight":0.795769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49420,"sim:weight":0.793974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43119,"sim:weight":0.777458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43123,"sim:weight":0.76019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85217,"sim:weight":0.726202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16091,"sim:weight":0.714723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43107,"sim:weight":0.714017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998006,"sim:weight":0.686788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43124,"sim:weight":0.684961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997739,"sim:weight":0.678824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16081,"sim:weight":0.669501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33748,"sim:weight":0.650421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102022,"sim:weight":0.644137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15412,"sim:weight":0.637097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The basic structure of a software system is given by a directed graph with vertices representing the programs of the system and arcs representing calls from one program to another. Generating a good partitioning into smaller modules becomes a minimization problem for the number of programs being called by external programs. First, we formulate an equivalent integer linear programming problem with 0–1 variables. theoretically, with this approach the problem can be solved to optimality, but this becomes very costly with increasing size of the software system. Second, we formulate the problem as a hypergraph partitioning problem. This is a heuristic method using a multilevel strategy, but it turns out to be very fast and to deliver solutions that are close to optimal.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bisseling, Rob H.","Byrka, Jarosław","Cerav-Erbas, Selin","Gvozdenovíc, Nebojša","Lorenz, Mathias","Pendavingh, Rudi","Reeves, Colin","Röger, Matthias","Verhoeven, Arie"],"dc:date":"2005-02-04","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T N Bui and C Jones.

{"identifier":16104,"ep:Repository":70,"dc:type":["Study Group Report","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Planning drinking water for airplanes","bibo:abstract":"The management of the Dutch national airline company KLM intends to bring a sufficient amount of water on board of all flights to fulfill customer’s demand. On the other hand, the surplus of water after a flight should be kept to a minimum to reduce fuel costs. The service to passengers is measured with a service level. The objective of this research is to develop models, which can be used to minimize the amount of water on board of flights such that a predefined service level is met. The difficulty that has to be overcome is the fact that most of the available data of water consumption on flights are rounded off to the nearest eighth of the water tank. For wide-body aircrafts this rounding may correspond to about two hundred litres of water. Part of the problem was also to define a good service level. The use of a service level as a model parameter would give KLM a better control of the water surplus. The available data have been analyzed to examine which aspects we had to take into consideration. Next, a general framework has been developed in which the service level has been defined as a Quality of Service for each flight: The probability that a sufficient amount of water is available on a given flight leg. Three approaches will be proposed to find a probability distribution function for the total water consumption on a flight. The first approach tries to fit a distribution for the water consumption based on the available data, without any assumptions on the underlying shape of the distribution. The second approach assumes normality for the total water consumption on a flight and the third approach uses a binomial distribution. All methods are validated and numerically illustrated. We recommend KLM to use the second approach, where the first approach can be used to determine an upper bound on the water level.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bijvank, Marco","Dobber, Menno","Soomer, Maarten","Botton, Quentin","de le Court, Eléonore","Van den Schrieck, Jean-Christophe","de Viron, Moïra","Cisneros-Molina, Myriam","Schmitz, Klaus","van der Hofstad, Remco","Jochemsz, Ellen","Mussche, Tim","Summer, Martin","Hoekstra, Maroescha","Mulder, Jeroen","Paelinck, Mark"],"dc:date":"2005-02-04","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M C M De Gunst and A W Van der Vaart.

On completion of surgery the blood is rewarmed by the HLM. A major consequence at the end of this process is afterdrop: a rapid decrease in the core organ temperature as a result of spatial temperature differences between the core organs and remainder of the body, which can lead to post-operative complications. This report details two mathematical models developed to understand heat transfer processes between the core organs, rectal region and peripheral body parts (primarily skin, muscle and fat). A one compartment spatially independent model, describing the temperature distribution of a single tissue type through which blood perfuses, shows that temperature dependent perfusion reproduces the observed differences in blood and tissue temperatures, whilst temperature independent perfusion does not. The model is extended to account for heat transfer between the blood pool (core), rectal regions and periphery. This three compartmental model is able to qualitatively reproduce the observed temperature differences in the three regions. Analysis of the model shows that a period of constant warming at the end of the rewarming period has a positive effect in reducing afterdrop.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tindall, Marcus","Peletier, Mark","Aitchison, Joyce","van Mourik, Simon","Severens, Natascha"],"dc:date":"2005-02-04","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Shtizer Biology, A and R C Eberhard.

If the sample contains the analyte (the substance being tested for) then an agglutination reaction occurs between it and the reagent in the channel, and the agglutinated complexes progressively slow the flow and may even block the channel, partially or completely, so that the flow only reaches the far end very slowly, or not at all. The aim is that this should give a reliable detection of quite low concentrations of analyte in the sample. Platform Diagnostics asked the Study Group to construct a mathematical model of the process, so that, for known binding forces in the agglutination complexes, we can design the channel size and shape, and the fluid viscosity, to maximize the reliable detection of low concentrations. A key question is how the flow time depends on channel size, fluid surface tension and viscosity, (a) in the absence of agglutination, and (b) in the presence of agglutination.","bibo:AuthorList":["Breward, Chris","Richardson, Giles"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Bell CG, Breward CJW, Howell PD, J Penfold and Thomas RK.

The first mathematical question is how one would quantify such a metabolic map in a statistical sense, in particular, where there are different levels of confidence for presense of different parts of the map. The next and most important question is how one can design a measurement strategy to maximise the confidence in the accuracy of the metabolic map.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tindall, Marcus","Rougier, Jonathan","Pickersgill, Laura","Melrose, John","O’Malley, Brendan","Jones, Janette"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A-L Baraba´si and Z N Oltvai.

The most promising one is based on the theory of time-delay systems, which allows capturing effects of the time-lag between the use of funds and the results related to scientific work. Moreover, the methodology gives an opportunity to seek the optimal spending scenario that would fulfill some prescribed constraints (e.g. it would minimize costs and at the same time remain above a desired level of quality of science).\r\n\r\nThe second methodology is premised on Stochastic Frontier Analysis and it can be applied to determine the form of relation between the amount of financing and the results of scientific work. It offers considerable advantages for analyses of several forms of relation at once (production functions) and for a suitable choice of the best one.\r\n\r\nBoth methods are promising, however, additional work is necessary to apply them successfully to some real-life problems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jakub, Lengiewicz","Krzysztof, Turek","Jacek, Lewkowicz","Poul, Hjorth","Agnieszka, Kaszkowiak","Anna, Kortyka","Mariusz, Marczewski","John, Ockendon","Wojciech, Okrasinski","Zbigniew, Peradzynski","Piotr, Wojdyllo","Karolina, Wojtasik","Maciej, Zmuda"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Pitcher.

The quality of these services is measured periodically using the so-called Key Performance Indicators (KPI).\r\n\r\nThere are more than 500 alternative operators and 63 different KPIs that measure the quality of services. The Office of Electronic Communications (UKE) receives periodic reports for each operator with specific data which can be arranged in one table. This table has a lot of cells that are not filled and its structure may differ in time, which poses the problem of how to compare alternative operators and indicate eventual discrimination. Proposed was the concept of defining discrimination. This approach is based on some additional parameters, which were determined, however, they have not been collected so far.\r\n\r\nThe main challenge was to design aggregated indicators measuring the quality of services rendered by the wholesale telecommunication operator to alternative operators. The indicators must be comparable, i.e. they should indicate whether some AOs are favoured or discriminated.\r\n\r\nAs a result, two different methods of computing aggregated indicators were proposed. The first one, Principal Component Analysis, is based on the reduction of data dimension, which facilitates further analysis. It shows whether some AOs are treated in a different way, when compared with others. This may indicate discrimination.\r\n\r\nThe second method aggregates all values of KPIs and assigns a real number to each alternative operator. Subsequently, rankings of AOs treatment can be set up. This method enables detection of a discriminated operator and was tested in simulations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Karolina, Baldys","Szymon, Charzynski","Karolina, Klepek","Krzysztof, Pytka","Mateusz, Zawisza"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2010).

The secondary objective was to provide methods for the evaluation of data loss and recovery. Additionally, we have provided the following initial constraints for the problem: a limitation of additional storage space, a minimal threshold for desired level of data integrity and a defined probability of a single-bit corruption.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the main objective, the study group focused on the exploration methods based on hash values. It has been indicated that in the case of tight constraints, suggested by PWPW, it is not possible to provide any method based only on the hash values. This observation stems from the fact that the high probability of bit corruption leads to unacceptably large number of broken hashes, which in turn stands in contradiction with the limitation for additional storage space.\r\n\r\nHowever, having loosened the initial constraints to some extent, the study group has proposed two methods that use only the hash values. The first method, based on a simple scheme of data subdivision in disjoint subsets, has been provided as a benchmark for other methods discussed in this report. The second method (\"hypercube\" method), introduced as a type of the wider class of clever-subdivision methods, is built on the concept of rewriting data-stream into a n-dimensional hypercube and calculating hash values for some particular (overlapping) sections of the cube.\r\n\r\nWe have obtained interesting results by combining hash value methods with error-correction techniques. The proposed framework, based on the BCH codes, appears to have promising properties, hence further research in this field is strongly recommended.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the report we have also presented features of secret sharing methods for the benefit of novel distributed data-storage scenarios. We have provided an overview of some interesting aspects of secret sharing techniques and several examples of possible applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Magorzata, Bladoszewska","Tomasz, Brozek","Michal, Zajac","Lucyna, Cieslik","Maria, Donten-Bury","Kamil, Kulesza","John, Ockendon","Lukasz, Stettner","Piotr, Wojdyllo","Wladimir, Zubkov"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Alfred J Menzes, Paul van Oorschot and Scott A Vanstone.

A model of simultaneous equations was developed which hoped to discriminate between the effect of the earth’s magnetic field and the possible UXO by solving for multiple dipoles using multiple data points. The simplifying assumption, that the location of each dipole is known, proved to produce unfavorable results when the flight path has a varying altitude making the model impractical.

The temperature in the water increases linearly with distance along the pipe and varies logarithmically with radial distance from the pipe in the concrete. Using these results we obtained estimates for the optimal spacing of pipes and pipe length. Some preliminary work on optimal network design has been done.

The elevated pressures are caused by the ignition of a propellant and may be as large as 1000MPa. We first consider time, length and pressure scales and then derive a model for the propagation of a two-dimensional crack. A number of aspects of this model are considered and similarity solutions and behaviour near the crack tip are investigated. Consideration is given to a simplified model where the elastic component of the interaction between the rock and the fluid is handled using an elementary closure law: in this case much progress may be made and closed-form solutions may be determined. Conditions are also identified where a model based on “impulsive” lubrication theory is appropriate. However, this leads to a very challenging problem. Finally, some other ways of extending the model to include (for example) fluid leak-off into the rock are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fitt, A.D.","Fowkes, N.D.","Mason, D.P.","Myers, T.G.","Moss, E.A.","Cheng, J."],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P W Bridgman.

One strategy adopted is to remove eggs from the mother, making her lay more eggs, and then incubating the removed eggs artificially. Artificial incubation machines must attempt to replicate the conditions of natural incubation as closely as possible. Aside from careful control of temperature and humidity within the artificial incubator, an important factor to reproduce is that eggs must be turned about their long axis from time to time. Hatching will not occur in an egg that is not subjected to some form of occasional rotation. The reason why eggs are turned and the way in which they should be turned are still not well understood. The Study Group attempted to gain some insight into why eggs have to be turned from a fluid dynamic perspective. A simple egg-turning model for an egg at the first stages of incubation was constructed, based on lubrication theory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edwards, Carina","Ovenden, Nick","Rottschäfer, Vivi"],"dc:date":"2003-04","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G K Batchelor.

The problem was divided into three sub-problems. First, calculations were made to describe the temperature of wine in a single bottle when subjected to an elevated external temperature, and then this was extended to pallets of cartons of wine. Second, equations were derived for the gas flow through the cork when a wine bottle is subject to oscillatory external temperatures, as is common in a domestic storage situation. Third, the temperature dependent reaction rates of the wine ageing process were considered and calculations performed on how elevated decrease shelf life. Suggestions were made as to relatively simple experiments that can be performed to test the models presented here.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mercer, Geoff","Wilkins, Andy","Crook, Jonathan","Barry, Steve","Fowler, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2284290,"sim:weight":0.819086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43107,"sim:weight":0.807179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101644,"sim:weight":0.782032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43122,"sim:weight":0.708477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16091,"sim:weight":0.702644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16093,"sim:weight":0.654209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16089,"sim:weight":0.646609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69568,"sim:weight":0.64258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50966,"sim:weight":0.642207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102041,"sim:weight":0.620481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934523,"sim:weight":0.5958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929856,"sim:weight":0.562806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43121,"sim:weight":0.55453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394133,"sim:weight":0.554376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103391,"sim:weight":0.455548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997548,"sim:weight":0.427474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43108,"sim:weight":0.394284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2284288,"sim:weight":0.392415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30600,"sim:weight":0.376778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98509,"sim:weight":0.372931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the manufacturing process, a melt stream emerges from a circular orifice and falls on to two successive spinning wheels, resulting in fiberisation. However, the process also results in a significant fraction of unfiberised material in the form of shot particles. The presence of shot tends to increase the thermal conductivity of the final product. Moreover, some areas of application, such as the automotive industry, require clean fibre with zero shot. Reducing the amount of shot that is produced in the fiberisation process would also reduce the costs of \u0027cleaning\u0027 the fibres for these markets. The Study Group was asked to look at how melt transfers on to the spinning wheels, what kind of melt layer exists on the wheels, and how this layer breaks up. By using a mathematical model to understand the relative importance of various parameters, it is hoped to guide experimental trials and then the scale-up to production levels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Breward, Chris","Dyson, Rosemary","Edwards, Carina","Metcalfe, Paul","Please, Colin","Zyskin, Maxim"],"dc:date":"2005-03-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":28024,"sim:weight":0.415858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.379915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43507,"sim:weight":0.363487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.336992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631632,"sim:weight":0.334699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.333045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.321452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43828,"sim:weight":0.311778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107076,"sim:weight":0.309263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.300334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.300334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.300334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.300334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.300334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.300334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.300334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.300334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.300334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.300334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.300334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In general, error probabilities depend on the tails of some probability distributions for which there has been no theoretical model.

NATS brought two questions to the Study Group, involving the horizontal (azimuthal) errors in radar data and the vertical errors in altimetry system data. In both cases, NATS asked the Study Group to analyse the data and assess whether the probability distributions that are currently used are good models for the errors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Budd, Chris","Hill, Andrew","Andre Leger, Andre"],"dc:date":"2004-11-23","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D J Higham and N J.

It forms a viscoelastic material.\r\n2. It has good gas retention since the diffusion of gases through the dough is small.\r\n3. It sets when cooked to form a solid foam.\r\n\r\nIn the study of dough rheology, mixing and baking, each of these properties generates the need for different types of mathematical considerations. For the Goodman Fielder problem presented at the 1997 Mathematics-In-Industry Study Group (MISG) meeting at Melbourne University, it is the first of these three properties which plays the crucial role in any study of the efficiency of the mixing of wheat flour dough.\r\n\r\nThe group studied the mechanics associated with the mixing of a large 300 kg dough mass within a Tweedy mixer rotating at 360 rpm subject to a cycle time of 4 minutes and concluded:\r\n1. The baffles along the side of the mixing chamber are essential for the elongation strains necessary for dough development.\r\n2. The impeller blades should have a circular rather than rectangular cross section to reduce the stress concentrations in the viscoelastic dough mass that lead to a cutting rather than stretching motion.\r\n3. A series of experimental tests needs to be performed to study the effects of: baffle geometry; mixing speed; and recirculating motions within the mixing chamber.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stump, D.","Anderssen, R.S."],"dc:date":"1997","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.306375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.300557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890288,"sim:weight":0.290796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.287382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.287382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.287382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.287382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.287382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.287382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.287382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.287382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.287382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.287382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.287382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.287382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.287382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.287382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.274383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.272859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43103,"sim:weight":0.26653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Seismic measurements are made by sending elastic waves into the earth (by setting off an artificial explosion at the earth’s surface) and recording the reflected elastic waves at the earth’s surface (using geophones on land and hydrophones offshore). Although this technique has been practiced since the beginning of the twentieth century, the major advances in seismic analysis have occurred during the last fifty years, and were spurred by the joint development of digital recording and the digital computer. Most of the techniques that have been developed for the analysis of seismic data can be classified as  deterministic. That is, we develop a deterministic physical model which relates the material properties of the subsurface of the earth to the physics of the transmitted and reflected seismic waves.\n\nMore recently, researchers have started using a statistical, rather than deterministic, approach to the determination of the earth’s subsurface and its reservoir parameters. That is one of the main approaches that we will use here. Thus, instead of assuming an underlying model, we will use multivariate statistical techniques to determine the earth’s subsurface, using a set of derived “attributes” from the seismic data.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yin, Yaling"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"C M Bishop.

A simplification is obtained by taking a hybrid approach where two different models are combined: relatively simple and fast models are used for simulating the tsunami event and the wave propagation through open water. The impact from tsunami inundation is simulated with another type of model which is suitable for resolving the details of the run-up process and the resulting inundation. The inundation modelling is conducted using the ANUGA model which is a result of collaboration between the Australian National University and Geoscience Australia. It solves the 2D nonlinear shallow water wave equations using a finite volume method.\n\nOne of the critical requirements for reliable inundation modelling is an accurate model of the earth\u0027s surface that extends from the open ocean through the inter-tidal zone into the onshore areas to be studied. Production of a sufficiently accurate elevation model is a complex and difficult process made more difficult because the available elevation data inevitably will come from a number of different sources and will have a range of vintages, resolutions and reliability.\n\nThere are two questions that arise when data is requested. The first deals with the true variability of the topography. Obviously, a flat surface needn’t be sampled nearly as finely as a highly convoluted surface. The second question relates to sensitivity; how are error bars derived for the impact results if the error bars on each elevation point is known? ANUGA solves the 2D nonlinear shallow water wave equations using a finite volume method and typical models can take days of computational time, so proper sensitivity analyses are often prohibitively expensive in terms of computational resources.\n\nThe main aim of this project was therefore to understand the uncertainties in the outputs of the inundation model based on possible uncertainty in the input data.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hocking, Graeme","Jakeman, John","Sexton, Jane","Wand, Matt"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101644,"sim:weight":0.669455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4891684,"sim:weight":0.636352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4886319,"sim:weight":0.631826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8929856,"sim:weight":0.607393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50966,"sim:weight":0.566814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9015667,"sim:weight":0.534536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4891609,"sim:weight":0.521361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4891675,"sim:weight":0.514252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930887,"sim:weight":0.502032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43108,"sim:weight":0.491828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394133,"sim:weight":0.489597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4891694,"sim:weight":0.456333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4891655,"sim:weight":0.452146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4891693,"sim:weight":0.439875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4891697,"sim:weight":0.427496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30600,"sim:weight":0.400579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98509,"sim:weight":0.393528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9537292,"sim:weight":0.381897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933921,"sim:weight":0.343573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3102953,"sim:weight":0.301611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At present such perturbations do not seemingly affect Nuclear Electric as most of their plant is run at more or less constant load, but they would like to be able to offer the national grid a mode of operation in which they \"followed\" the grid frequency: i.e., as the frequency rose above or fell below 50 Hz, the plant\u0027s output would be adjusted so as to tend to restore the frequency to 50 Hz. The aim is to maintain grid frequency within 0.2 Hz of its notional value. Such a mode of operation, however, would cause a certain amount of damage to plant components owing to the consequent continual changes in temperature and pressure within them.\r\n\r\nNuclear Electric currently have complex computational models of how plants will behave under these conditions, which allows them to compute plant data (e.g., reactor temperatures) from given grid frequency data. One approach to damage assessment would require several years\u0027-worth of real grid data to be fed into this model and the corresponding damage computed (via \"cycle distributions\" created by their damage experts). The results of this analysis would demonstrate one of three possibilities: the damage may be acceptable under all reasonable operating conditions; or it may be acceptable except in the case of an exceptional abrupt change in grid frequency (caused by power transmission line failure, or another power station suddenly going off-line, for instance), in which case some kind of backup supply (e.g., gas boilers) would be required; or it may simply be unacceptable.\r\n\r\nHowever, their current model runs in approximately real time, making it inappropriate for such a large amount of data: our problem was to suggest alternative approaches. Specifically, we were asked the following questions:\r\n\r\n- Can component damage be reliably estimated directly from cycle distributions of grid frequency? i.e., are there maps from frequency cycle distributions to plant parameter cycle distributions?\r\n\r\n- Can a simple model of plant dynamics be used to assess the potential for such maps?\r\n\r\n- What methods can be used to select representative samples of grid frequency behaviour?\r\n\r\n- What weightings should be applied to the selections?\r\n\r\n- Is it possible to construct a \"cycle transform\" (Fourier transform) which will capture the essential features of grid frequency and which can then be inverted to generate simulated frequency transients?\r\n\r\nWe did not consider this last question, other than to say \"probably not\".\r\n\r\nWe were supplied with data of the actual grid frequency measurements for the evening of 29/7/95, and the corresponding plant responses (obtained using Nuclear Electric\u0027s current computational model). A simplified nonlinear mathematical model of the plant was also provided.\r\n\r\nTwo main approaches were considered: statistical prediction and analytical modelling via a reduction of the simplified plant model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hunt, R.","Fowler, A.","Hanche-Olsen, H.","Drye, T.","Gilmour, I.","McSharry, P.","Please, C.P.","Smith, S.L."],"dc:date":"1996","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9039833,"sim:weight":0.465814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890329,"sim:weight":0.453535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.451579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4894931,"sim:weight":0.41704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.416514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186392,"sim:weight":0.400086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890288,"sim:weight":0.377081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45926,"sim:weight":0.376024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.374117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.374117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.374117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.374117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.374117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.374117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.374117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.374117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.374117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.374117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.374117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.374117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The radioactivity splits some water molecules into free radicals, which are thought to recombine on suitable catalytic sites to form hydrogen gas. The rate of production of gas (hydrogen and other species) is typically about 4m^3/day in the SY-101 tanks. When the concentration of hydrogen in the roof of the tank exceeds 4%, there is a risk of deflagration. The study group was asked to consider the mode in which the gas is released, whether as dangerous large eruptions or as acceptable continuous background release. We were also asked how much gas was stored in the sludge, where and in what form. The sludge is neither solid nor fluid, but rather a yield material with a yield stress of about 103 Pa.\r\n\r\nThe study group based its approach on a video produced by Pacific Northwest of a laboratory experiment in which gas was generated in a yield material. In these experiments oxygen was produced from hydrogen peroxide, and the material was a clay suspension. The video showed bubbles growing in the material, and the height of the sample rising, rather like baking bread. After some time, some bubbles were large enough to overlap, and they merged. The result of several mergers was to form cracks, fairly horizontal, which grew by being inflated by gas and then breaking sideways into a nearby bubble.

The process involves charging the paint particles as they pass through a \u0027gun\u0027; they then travel towards the workpiece under the influence of aerodynamic and electrostatic forces. At present two types of gun are used, these are:\r\n- the Corona gun in which particles are forced past a high voltage electrode which ionises the surrounding air and hence particles are charged by collecting ions (Paulthier Charging).\r\n- the Tribo gun in which particles are charged in an earthed gun directly by friction.\r\n\r\nThe main differences between these two types of gun are:\r\n- when using a corona gun the electric field is set up not only by the space-charge but also by the applied potential difference between the gun and workpiece.\r\n- free ions constitute 99% of the charge in a corona system, whilst no free ions are present when using a tribo gun.\r\n\r\nAs the corona gun involves many more complicated physical processes, it is the tribo gun, with a single species of particle, which is considered in this report.\r\n\r\nThe main questions asked by Courtaulds were\r\n- What factors affect deposition efficiency?\r\n- How is deposition efficiency maximised?\r\n\r\nThis report is organised into three main sections.\r\nFirstly, a tribo gun model is presented and non-dimensionalised, revealing that electrostatic and aerodynamic forces are in balance, whilst particle inertia and gravity may be neglected for the system in question. \r\nThen, a one-dimensional model is considered which gives vital information about the orders of magnitude of relevant quantities at the workpiece and the effect of charge saturation.\r\nFinally, a model is proposed for a narrow \u0027jet\u0027 of particles impinging on an earthed workpiece and it it shown that geometry is by far the most important factor affecting deposition efficiency.","bibo:AuthorList":["Addison, J.","Budd, C.","Forth, S.","Grinfield, M.","Harris, T.","Hogg, A.","Lister, J.","Tabraham, J.","Taylor, J.","Wylie, J."],"dc:date":"1996","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"C J Budd and A A Wheeler.

For the particular system considered by Perkins Technology, fuel at a temperature of about 300 K arrives in the injector at approximately 1400 bar and is then injected into the cylinder in 1.5 ms by raising a needle and uncovering the nozzle holes. The cycle period between injections is 40 ms. Each injection contains 85 mm^3 of fluid. This corresponds almost exactly to the amount of fuel stored in the annulus around the needle below the spherical reservoir. The physical quantity of interest is the temperature of the fuel when it is injected into the cylinder. Temperature measurements in the fuel storage volume are hard to make. A thermocouple placed in the wall of the injector tip, however, has measured a temperature of 550 K.\r\n\r\nThe various contributions to the change in temperature    of the fluid can be summarised as:\r\n  (a) -5 K from the adiabatic cooling\r\n  (b) 15 K from the convection near the nozzle\r\n  (c) ΔT_s/17 from the conduction in the annulus. This depends on the average temperature of the wall of the annulus, which is unknown, but certainly between 300 and 5.50 K, corresponding to ΔT_s \u003d 0-250 K. Hence the smallest and largest rises in temperature are 0 and 15 K respectively.\r\n\r\nThe maximal rise in temperature of the fluid is hence 25 K. A more likely estimate might be 10 K.\r\n\r\nSome useful data, in the absence of actual heat measurements inside the fuel reservoir around the needle, would be the temperature of the wall TB. Knowledge of its spatial variation would also be of interest, since it has just been been treated as an average in this report.","bibo:AuthorList":["Byatt-Smith, J.","Day, R.","Harlen, O.","Lister, J.","Smith, S.L.","Please, C.P.","Stone, R.","Howison, S.D.","Fowler, A."],"dc:date":"1996","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H S Carslaw and J C Jaeger.

Soot is mostly composed of polycyclicaromatic compounds and results from the incomplete combustion of the diesel fuel in the engine. The average size of the particles formed in the engine is in the range 3 to 10 nm in diameter, but this is known to increase within the exhaust system.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of this report we determine the minimum particle size that can be removed by centrifugal separation. \r\nThe second part discusses the mechanisms for particle growth within the exhaust system in order to estimate the particle growth rate.\r\n\r\nIn section two we estimate the minimum particle diameter that can be removed by a cyclone separator is around one micron. This estimate is consistent with current applications of hydrocyclones. The particle size  measurements by Perkins Technology together with our estimates from section three, suggest that the soot particles are an order of magnitude smaller than this. Although it may be possible to remove some particles less than one micron in diameter with a well designed high-speed cyclone, we do not think it will be possible to remove a substantial proportion of 100 nm or smaller particles.\r\n\r\nThe growth rate of the particles increases if the particles volume fraction or the polydispersity is increased.

These \u0027customer reels\u0027 must be cut from a set of wider \u0027jumbo reels\u0027, in as economical a way as possible. The first priority is to minimize the waste, i.e. to satisfy the customer demands using as few jumbo reels as possible. This is an example of the one-dimensional cutting stock problem, which has an extensive literature. Greycon have developed cutting stock algorithms which they include in their software packages.\r\n\r\nGreycon\u0027s initial presentation to the Study Group posed several questions, which are listed below, along with (partial) answers arising from the work described in this report.\r\n\r\n(1) Given a minimum-waste solution, what is the minimum number of patterns required?\r\n\r\nIt is shown in Section 2 that even when all the patterns appearing in minimum-waste solutions are known, determining the minimum number of patterns may be hard. It seems unlikely that one can guarantee to find the minimum number of patterns for large classes of realistic problems with only a few seconds on a PC available.\r\n\r\n(2) Given an n → n-1 algorithm, will it find an optimal solution to the minimum- pattern problem?\r\n\r\nThere are problems for which n → n - 1 reductions are not possible although a more dramatic reduction is.\r\n\r\n(3) Is there  an efficient  n → n-1 algorithm?\r\n\r\nIn light of Question 2, Question 3 should perhaps be rephrased as \u0027Is there an efficient algorithm to reduce n patterns?\u0027 However, if an algorithm guaranteed to find some reduction whenever one existed then it could be applied iteratively to minimize the number of patterns, and we have seen this cannot be done easily.\r\n\r\n(4) Are there efficient 5 → 4 and 4 → 3 algorithms?\r\n(5) Is it worthwhile seeking alternatives to greedy heuristics?\r\n\r\nIn response to Questions 4 and 5, we point to the algorithm described in the report, or variants of it. Such approaches seem capable of catching many higher reductions.\r\n\r\n(6) Is there a way to find solutions with the smallest   possible number of single patterns?\r\n\r\nThe Study Group did not investigate methods tailored specifically to this task, but the algorithm proposed here seems to do reasonably well. It will not increase the number of singleton patterns under any circumstances, and when the number of singletons is high there will be many possible moves that tend to eliminate them.\r\n\r\n(7) Can a solution be found which reduces the number  of knife changes?\r\n\r\nThe algorithm will help to reduce the number of necessary knife changes because it works by bringing patterns closer together, even if this does not proceed fully to a pattern reduction. If two patterns are equal across some of the customer widths, the knives for these reels need not be changed when moving from one to the other.","bibo:AuthorList":["Aldridge, C.","Chapman, S.

La misma consiste en un conjunto de herramientas informáticas cuyo objetivo es la detección y diagnóstico de eventos anormales en procesos. Dentro de la industria petroquímica el diagnóstico temprano de eventos anormales es de vital importancia por la peligrosidad de los procesos involucrados. Es ilustrativo mencionar que las pérdidas anuales asociadas a los eventos anormales en la industria petroquímica de Estados Unidos ascienden a los 20.000.000.000 de dólares.\r\nLos procesos de interés son procesos continuos que operan en estado estacionario. Los mismos son controlados por operadores en salas de control donde, desde una terminal de PC, pueden obtener información on-line de diferentes variables de proceso como así también, actuar sobre el proceso variando la apertura de válvulas. Además, existen sistemas de control automático que regulan la apertura de ciertas válvulas de control para estabilizar el proceso. El MIP pretende brindar soporte a los operadores en la tarea de diagnóstico de eventos anormales.\r\nEl método de diagnóstico de fallas planteado se basa en el seguimiento del signo de la desviación de cada variable (perturbación) como consecuencia de una determinada falla. En el paper adjunto, se muestra una técnica para determinar, a partir de las ecuaciones que describen el comportamiento de un proceso, el signo de la perturbación de cada variable frente a diferentes fallas que pueden ocurrir en un proceso dado.\r\nEl método de diagnóstico consiste en asignarle al vector de perturbaciones obtenido a partir de la medición actual de las variables de la planta, alguno de los vectores precalculados asociados a las fallas conocidas. Esto plantea dos problemas distintos. Por un lado la necesidad de automatizar la generación del vector de perturbaciones a partir del modelo analítico del proceso y por otro determinar el signo de la perturbación de cada variable a partir de la caracterización de la serie temporal y de la situación actual del proceso.\r\nEl primer problema está planteado en el paper adjunto y requiere de cierto conocimiento de los procesos involucrados y de teoría de grafos. Los interesados en el mismo pueden referirse dicho paper. El segundo es más abstracto y sólo requiere de conocimiento de series temporales. A continuación se da una breve introducción al mismo. Para determinar el signo de la variación de una variable perturbada es necesario tener en cuenta dos características del sistema en estudio. La primera es la variabilidad natural del mismo que nos permite saber si la perturbación medida es significativa o es parte del ruido natural del proceso. \r\nLa segunda es el tiempo característico de los procesos asociados a dicha variable que nos indica cuanto tiempo debemos esperar para que la perturbación se haga evidente en la medición.\r\nEl segundo problema a resolver consiste en la caracterización de las series temporales de las variables medidas para poder determinar la presencia y el signo de una perturbación en cada una de ellas. Para ello se contará con datos reales de una planta petroquímica tomados a intervalos cercanos a un minuto durante un periodo de 7 años.

Actualmente, durante los primeros y los últimos días de la zafra (cosecha temprana y cosecha tardía), la caña madura no es suficiente para satisfacer la demanda de los ingenios. Inversamente, en el período intermedio la cantidad de caña sobresatura la capacidad de procesamiento. Como consecuencia se produce menos azúcar de la que se podría. Teniendo esto en cuenta, la racionalización del transporte sería un primer paso en el avance hacia un sistema más eficiente.\r\nSin perder de vista este objetivo, la simple puesta en práctica, en el corto plazo, de un criterio optimizado de distribución representaría una mejora respecto de la situación actual. En primer lugar, disminuiría el consumo de combustible. Debe tenerse en cuenta que uno de los subproductos de la caña es el alcohol, a partir del cual se produce el bioetanol, y con el que se rebaja, por ley, un 5% de las naftas. En este sentido, la reducción del consumo de combustibles fósiles adquiere una doble importancia. Por otro lado, un mejor sistema de distribución tendría también una importante repercusión social. Los camiones que transportan la caña viajan usualmente de noche, sin luces y a muy baja velocidad y son, en consecuencia, responsables de numerosos accidentes de tránsito, puesto que no son vistos a tiempo por los automovilistas. La disminución de la cantidad de camiones recorriendo las rutas y caminos de la provincia contribuiría a reducir la cantidad de accidentes.\r\nFinalmente, un sistema optimizado de distribución serviría, en vistas del problema general, como herramienta de diagnóstico permitiendo señalar algunos puntos por mejorar.\r\nPodrían, por ejemplo, identificarse zonas en las que sería provechoso cambiar la plantación de una variedad de maduración tardía a una de maduración temprana, con la que proveer a los ingenios cercanos en el primer período de zafra.","bibo:AuthorList":["Diez, Oscar","Will, Adrián","Rodríguez, Sebastián","Charó, Gisela","Salvagni, Luciana","Moldavsky, Irina","Morrow, Santiago Basso","Carrá, Federico","Rosito, Claus","Ojea, Ignacio","Tarzia, Domingo","Spies, Rubén","Etcheverry, Javier"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":889624,"sim:weight":0.837419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1020829,"sim:weight":0.834014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":971375,"sim:weight":0.832647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":889651,"sim:weight":0.831907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":889649,"sim:weight":0.831802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1021181,"sim:weight":0.83169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2691361,"sim:weight":0.831625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":889563,"sim:weight":0.831124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":700684,"sim:weight":0.830557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1021180,"sim:weight":0.827491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":972037,"sim:weight":0.826607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":600941,"sim:weight":0.826516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":971362,"sim:weight":0.826253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":576884,"sim:weight":0.826123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":889622,"sim:weight":0.825576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":889647,"sim:weight":0.824574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1020666,"sim:weight":0.824495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":889557,"sim:weight":0.824375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090313,"sim:weight":0.824165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":889520,"sim:weight":0.822653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This problem involves the formation of calcium carbonate crystals in a gas diffusion process. Experiments showed the formation of clear shapes in the presence of a serum protein. These structures appear to be formed from calcium carbonate fibers arranged in cones, fiber bundles, discs, and other shapes. Some characteristics of the crystals, such as the layering of self similar structures, suggest a process which regulates crystallization. Here we propose a mechanism for the formation of calcium carbonate fibers and their assembly in the complex structures. We describe this process in two systems of partial differential equations. We aim to simulate the growth of these crystals in order to understand the effect of the concentrations and diffusion of the different elements and compounds that are present in the reaction, in the global regulator of the crystallization process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morfin, M.","Bohun, C.

Although the process for the removal of urea and other unwanted charged species is understood, the effect of this removal on the net sodium concentration in the blood after treatment is not clear. In this report, we focus on formulating a fundamentally-based model to address this question. We consider the formulation near the membrane at the pore scale in order to determine effective jump conditions in ionic concentrations, electric potential and flow rate based on the membrane properties, and in order to determine whether electroneutrality holds within the pore. Secondly, we consider the local blood-cell concentration within one of the fibres and how this varies axially within the dialysis cartridge. Lastly, we consider a simple one-dimensional model of the charged species problem and find that advection transport through the membrane is important for sodium transport, but less pertinent for transport of other cation species.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tilley, B.

Bone adapts to its mechanical environment by altering its shape and increasing its size in response to increases in mechanical load associated with exercise, and by decreasing its size in response to decreases in mechanical load associated with microgravity or prolonged bed rest. Changes in bone size and shape are produced by a cooperative action of two main types of the bone cells - osteoclasts that destroy bone and osteoblasts that build bone. These cell types come from different developmental origins, and vary greatly in their characteristics, such as size, shape, and expression of receptor subtypes, which potentially may affect their responses to mechanical stimuli. The objective of this study is to compare the responses of osteoclasts and osteoblasts to mechanical stimulation.\r\n\r\nThis study has allowed us to conclude the following:\r\n1. A mediator is released from a single source cell.\r\n2. The response to the mediator changes with distance.\r\n3. The value of the apparent diffusion coeficient increases with distance.\r\n4. A plausible proposed mechanism is that ATP is released and degrades to ADP.\r\n5. Future experiments are required to confim that ATP is the mediator as suggested.","bibo:AuthorList":["Komarova, S.

The challenge presented by Saudi Aramco is to solve the inverse problem for multiple point sources on the full elastic wave equation, taking into account all frequencies for the best resolution. \r\n\r\nThe state-of-the-art methods use optimisation to find the seismic properties of the rocks, such that when used as the coefficients of the equations of a model, the measurements are reproduced as closely as possible. This process requires regularisation if one is to avoid instability. The approach can produce a realistic image but does not account for uncertainty arising, in general, from the existence of many different patterns of properties that also reproduce the measurements.\r\n\r\nIn the Study Group a formulation of the problem was developed, based upon the principles of Bayesian statistics. First the state-of-the-art optimisation method was shown to be a special case of the Bayesian formulation. This result immediately provides insight into the most appropriate regularisation methods. Then a practical implementation of a sequential sampling algorithm, using forms of the Ensemble Kalman Filter, was devised and explored.","bibo:AuthorList":["Farmer, C.","Hoteit, I.","Luo, X.","Boonyasiriwat, C.","Alkhalifah, T."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K Aki and P G Richards.

A parallel finite element model was setup and run on one of the KAUST multiprocessor machines and produced significant speedups with very little effort allowing practical parametric studies to be performed. The study group also noted that additional optimizations both in the finite element model and in analytical or semi-analytical representations of the bodies in contact can produce additional speedups.

The apparatus consists of a rock disk attached to a rotating shaft; the rock is submerged in a solution of reactant which is transferred to the disk surface by convection and molecular diffusion. The former due to the rotation of the disk, and the latter due to the concentration gradient of the reactant between the bulk fluid and the rock surface.\r\n\r\nSchlumberger is interested in determining how to use the rotating disk experiments to extract parameters that govern the reaction rate between the acid and carbonate rock. For mass transfer limited reactions these include (i) the diffusion rate across the boundary layer, and (ii) the thickness of the boundary layer. For a reaction that is surface limited, (i) the reaction rate and, (ii) the reaction order are of paramount interest.\r\n\r\nThe Study Group began by reanalyzing the solution by Levitch coupled with numerical solutions of the flow in the hope that it would lead to a deeper understanding of the fluid dynamics in the neighbourhood of the rock. In particular, how the fluid flow changes as the Reynolds number is increased and how this might indicate the most ideal location to measure the calcium in the reaction vessel.\r\n\r\nThe modelling looked not only at the coupling of the fluid flow with the diffusion equation for the ions but also a preliminary Stefan problem for the dissolving rock.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bohun, C.

These high-permeability channels are created by pumping \\emph{fracturing fluid} into the bore hole at high pressure, which can crack the rock.\r\nOnce established most of the subsequent fluid flows out of the fractures as a result of their high permeability, thus inhibiting further cracking. This problem is resolved by injecting a \\emph{diverter fluid} containing particles and fibres, to plug the fractures temporarily and allow another cycle of fracturing fluid to stimulate a different region of the oil well. Finally the plugs, termed \\emph{filtercakes} are removed and oil production in the well commences.\r\n\r\nIn this report we investigate how the size and shape distributions, concentration, and material properties of particles and fibres in the diverter fluid affect the formation of the filtercakes. We consider how these properties may be engineered to maximize clogging in fractures and cavities, as near to the bore hole as possible, whilst minimizing the amount of material wasted.\r\n\r\nThe problem is approached by considering the two distinct aspects of the behaviour, namely the flow of particulates from the bore into the fracture, and the fracture clogging. A series of mathematical models are employed that elucidate the system behaviour, allowing us to offer guidance on the appropriate choice for the design parameters to optimize clogging.","bibo:AuthorList":["Griffiths, I.","Gallimore, L."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Aris.

This study analyzes the effect, for radiation of 1 to 100 Mhz, of discrete inclusions having a different permittivity from the surrounding medium. The focus is on the effect of certain geometric features, namely, the individual size of the inclusions, their overall volume fraction, the presence of sharp edges, and their aspect ratio. \r\n\r\nIt is found that the volume fraction has the strongest impact on the effective permittivity, linear at first but higher order at higher volume fractions. The aspect ratio of the inclusions has a moderate effect, which is exaggerated in the extreme case of needle-like inclusions, and which can also be seen in a stronger nonlinearity. There is also a possibility that some features in the shape of the inclusion boundaries may influence the frequency dependence of the effective permittivity. Inclusion size and sharp edges have negligible effect.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hadj-Sassi, K.","Clawson, R."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"K Asami. (2002).

Attempts have been made to desgin experiments in petri-dishes that mimic the \u0027Conditions of tumour growth. The first of the experiments is the \u0027matrigel\u0027 assay. Matrigel provides a matrix for the endothelial cells to grow on, and contains all the nutrients that the cells need. It is found that in the matrigel assay blood vessels didn\u0027t form, although some transient strucutres formed at early times in the experiment. The second experiment is the \u0027biocure\u0027 assay. In this experiment the petri dish is filled with both endothelial and fibroblast cells. The fibroblasts form a strucutal supporting network for the endothelial cells. Tubules resembling blood-vessels formed after about ten days in the biocure asssay. \r\n\r\nThe process of cell differentiation is thought to be important in the growth of blood vessels. Cells can sense that they are part of a blood vessel, and change their shape to form tubules. Also it is likely that they change their chemical messaging properties, and their abilities to bind to other endothelial cells. \r\n\r\nA model is developed that describes cell differentiation, and separates cells into different classes. For simplicity the spatial distribution of cells in different classes is ignored. Using simple population dynamics, a set of coupled non-linear ODEs is developed to describe the dynamics of the system. The system is found to have two different long-time states, one corresponding to the formation of blood vessels and one where vessels did not form. The ratio of the cell proliferation rate to the cell maturity rate (the time it takes to realise that it is part of a blood vessel) is critical in determining which is the final state of the system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hinch, R."],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46894,"sim:weight":0.457206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81367,"sim:weight":0.402803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710126,"sim:weight":0.398313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98810,"sim:weight":0.388402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890329,"sim:weight":0.385124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386752,"sim:weight":0.371124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890296,"sim:weight":0.35278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43075,"sim:weight":0.346964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105466,"sim:weight":0.340894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101404,"sim:weight":0.337048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85525,"sim:weight":0.334671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586790,"sim:weight":0.334408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98823,"sim:weight":0.33319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934278,"sim:weight":0.330042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386758,"sim:weight":0.329178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43308,"sim:weight":0.328466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768938,"sim:weight":0.324176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26952,"sim:weight":0.323193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98537,"sim:weight":0.317753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890320,"sim:weight":0.31328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

First, we derive a model for the oscillatory behavior of polymer flow in an extruder given a functional relation between the pressure and flow rate. A simple isothermal but temperature dependent model is constructed to find this relation. Unfortunately, the model is shown to be invalid in the physical regime of interest. We present several arguments to suggest that the isothermal assumption is reasonable but that a more detailed understanding of the small-scale molecular dynamics near the boundary may be required. Second, we show that a simplified model for thermoflow multiplicity in a cooled tube is inconsistent, when the stationary non-Newtonian flow is assumed to be incompressible without radial pressure gradients and without radial velocity. This inconsistency can be removed by allowing for weak compressibility effects in the down-steam area.","bibo:AuthorList":["Berg, J.B.","Bokhove, O.","Peletier, M.","Williams, J.F.","Zwart, H."],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"C F J den Doe1der.

For many reasons the reduction of the water production is a very important issue. The method presented in this paper is meant to provide a necessary tool for this. Most drilling wells consist of a network of bore holes. Some of them may produce water, others oil or a mixture. At the moment the net flow of all bore holes together is brought to the surface. It is desirable to be able to detect how much water a specific bore hole contributes. If this amount surpasses a critical value one could then consider to close that bore hole. This leads to the question how the composition of the flow in a pipe can be determined in situ. In this paper we analyze how tomography techniques, well-known from medical applications, can be applied in the case of a bore hole. These techniques allow to measure instantaneously the mass distribution over a cross section of the pipe. For velocity estimation, the idea is to detect the mass distributions at two neighbouring cross sections at successive times. Correlating the obtained time series, one might be able to estimate the local velocity profile. The basic idea was already mentioned in literature before, but it was believed that the number of correlations to be evaluated is so huge, that the approach would fail in practice. In this paper we describe the mathematical details of the method and conclude that the number of time consuming calculations is not necessarily a limiting factor. In addition, suggestions are made to facilitate the use of tomography for velocity estimation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cahyono, E.","Hochstenbach, M.","Moienaar, J.","Schilders, W.H.A","Terra, G.M."],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E Somersalo, M Cheney and D Isaacson.

Modern commercial paper-making machines are huge items of equipment. They may be as long as a football field and cost many millions of dollars each. Integrity of the process is extremely important; the paper in such a machine travels so fast (up to 20 km/sec) that a break is viewed as a major calamity and may take many man-hours and dollars to recover from. The size and speed of the machines means that it is not easy to make measurements as the paper passes through. The hostility of the environment therefore dictates that a thorough theoretical understanding of the important parts of the process is crucial if the processes involved are to be optimized.\r\n\r\nIn this study we do not seek to answer anyone specific question, but rather wish to propose a general framework for modeling the flow and deformation under a roll press nip. Because of the difficulty of making measurements in the nip region and the need to closely control the process, the distributions of pressure, velocity and felt porosity within the nip have traditionally been subjects of great debate. \r\n\r\nPrevious treatments have included lubrication theory models and \"Bernoulli\" based models. Although some progress may be made using thin layer theory, we shall show the required modeling does not take the form of standard lubrication theory. As far as models based on Bernoulli\u0027s equation are concerned, we simply note that the discussion below shows that the drag force exerted by the felt on the liquid is a key physical component of the flow process. Clearly, a full three-phase flow treatment is required. In this study we will thus address the following questions:\r\n\r\n(i) Is it possible to propose a general theoretical treatment of the roll press nip?\r\n(ii) What determines the physics of the water movement within the paper and felt in the roll press nip and how is this connected to the details of the air movement and the deformation of the felt?\r\n(iii) When a general model has been proposed, is it possible exploit the geometry within the nip to generate some simple exact solutions?\r\n(iv) What are the key non-dimensional parameters in the problem and how large are they likely to be for realistic paper-making machines?\r\n\r\nA further matter of interest concerns the influence that the size, shape and separation of the rollers have on the whole process. We approach the modeling from a rather general point of view, beginning by including all effects that might be important and then making clearly defined assumptions to simplify the equations. In this way it is possible to make changes to the model if circumstances change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fitt, A.D.","Schwendeman, D."],"dc:date":"1999","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":28024,"sim:weight":0.584083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.410316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.392104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25850,"sim:weight":0.380537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.352533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75482,"sim:weight":0.326333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.319213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.309179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An attempt was made to suggest schemes that improve system performance. We define system performance to be improved noise immunity with high reliability and increased message throughput.\r\n\r\nThree aspects were considered, with implementation schemes that incur minimal protocol changes over systems in existence.\r\n\r\n1. The present scheme is writing to the pacemaker and echoing each bit back within a 2ms frame. If any echoed bit is not in agreement with that sent, the message is re-transmitted from the start of the block. Because the return link is poor in terms of signal to noise ratio, echoing bits up this link degrades system performance, particularly as the noise power increases. An ARQ (autamatic repeat request) scheme is suggested as a solution to this problem.\r\n\r\n2. When data is to be read from the pacemaker, reply is via two 4ms frames each of 6 bits. A CRC (cyclic redundancy check) is performed on the returned data (8 bits) which checks for three or less errors, and the redundancy bits are appended to the end of the 9 bits. If any errors are detected, a retransmission is required. Using a FEC (forward error correction) scheme to correct errors, together with a CRC to check the integrity of data, throughput can be significantly improved especially in a noisy environment. The scheme we suggest is to encode data bits plus CRC with a 23,12 Golay code, and send the data using four by 4ms frames. The Golay code suggested is a perfect code, triple error correcting.\r\n\r\n3. The final aspect we considered is the possible system performance  improvement using soft decision quantization at the programmer of received data. This system gives gains of the order of 1.75 dB over current practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["\u003d, \u003d"],"dc:date":"1985","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R G Gallager. (1968).

Conduction is found to be the dominant mode of heat transfer, and the interface is characterised as imperfect contact if there are no surface manufacturing defects larger than 139 microns. A model is proposed to estimate the effective conductivity for imperfect contact. This thermal conductance depends on the area of contact, macroscopic roughness, the contact pressure and the interstitial medium. The transfer of heat and the distribution of stress in line red engine blocks are coupled, and the problem is strongly non-linear. A finite element solution procedure for solving the heat transfer problem in the linered engine block is outlined.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ha, J."],"dc:date":"1991","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R M Phelan.

If centre buckles occur, the strip is said to have a \u0027long centre\u0027 while edge buckles are usually attributed to \u0027long edges\u0027. If the wavelength and amplitude of the buckles are large, the shape of the buckles will obviously depend on the configuration in which the strip is held. For example, we expect the pattern of buckles of a strip laid on a flat table to be different those of a strip suspended between two rollers and subjected to tension. It is observed in practice, however, that buckling occurs in some cases with a characteristic wavelength that is relatively robust to strip configuration.\r\n\r\nAn understanding of buckling patterns is of considerable interest to manufacturers of strip, particularly as current trends are to produce thinner sheet which is consequently more prone to buckling. The specific question that BHP Coated Products Division asked the Study Group to consider was whether long centres and edges could give rise to buckling patterns with a robust characteristic frequency.","bibo:AuthorList":["\u003d, \u003d"],"dc:date":"1988","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4890291,"sim:weight":0.401382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28024,"sim:weight":0.389939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890341,"sim:weight":0.38173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386758,"sim:weight":0.379285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890296,"sim:weight":0.376257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.371598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890329,"sim:weight":0.357213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98585,"sim:weight":0.342516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101627,"sim:weight":0.341064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890320,"sim:weight":0.328785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890288,"sim:weight":0.323875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764134,"sim:weight":0.322068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43981,"sim:weight":0.315112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101588,"sim:weight":0.313608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101339,"sim:weight":0.302617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.300969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664613,"sim:weight":0.30013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.30003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.299312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4872629,"sim:weight":0.296492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The two-piece shaft requires less floor clearance, and hence a smaller floor tunnel, and does not suffer from the high-speed twisting resonances to which the one-piece shaft is susceptible.\r\n\r\nThe two-piece shaft is, however, susceptible to a lower speed, high load (high torque) phenomenon in which the propshaft whirls with increasing amplitude until its restraining rubber bush is fully compressed in its mounting bracket, causing a thump sound. The whirling amplitude builds up periodically, so that a regular series of thumps is heard at a frequency of about 5 per second.\r\n\r\nThe effect is very sensitive to the properties of the rubber bush and to its temperature. Different designs of bush are used by different makers, each with the purpose of minimizing both the whirling problem and the transmission of other vibrations to the car body. \r\n\r\nGMH has a particular design which it would prefer not to vary, because of retooling costs. It can however vary the properties of the rubber material itself. By trial and error it has achieved rubber properties which control the whirling problem to an acceptable level under normal conditions. GMH posed the question, to the MISG, of whether one can give theoretical guidelines for optimal rubber properties. This might lead to improved control of the whirling problem. It would also be useful for new and modified propshafts, if it could replace the tedious trial and error process previously employed.\r\n\r\nGMH were also anxious to gain a better understanding of the whirling phenomenon, and felt, with us, that a mathematical description of the phenomenon was a prerequisite for the study of the rubber properties. The thumping phenomenon is observed at both 40 and 80 kph approximately, although the phenomenon had a different quality at these two speeds.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gates, D."],"dc:date":"1989","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"N N Bogoliubov and Y A Metropolski.

Information on vehicle work content is available prior to arrival at the PBS, and GMHAL wants advice on using this data and the PBS to achieve a more satisfactory input to Final Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Study Group devised three approaches.\r\n1. Use the rules to show which short sequences are desirable and devise input and output strategies for the PBS to achieve these consistently. Choice between the strategies requires further investigation.\r\n2. Model Final Assembly to produce an optimality criterion for vehicle sequences and use combinatorial optimization methods to optimise it over possible PBS outputs. A characterization of these outputs was derived.\r\n3.

Industrially, it is important to control the size distribution of zinc particles. It is therefore necessary to understand the features of the process, guided where appropriate by simple mathematical models and estimates. This report examines qualitative features using simple models for number of drops produced, estimates for air speed and swirl, heat transfer in the molten zinc and droplets, and droplet collisions and stability. Results from a literature survey are presented. At this stage, the construction of more elaborate mathematical models for the process is not warranted; rather, we expect that better understanding of the process requires an experimental program involving flow visualisation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barton, N."],"dc:date":"1992","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G K Batchelor.

It is concluded that bulk flow models and the simple continuum model are inadequate for such use, principally because they are unable to account for geometrical effects which affect the flow. However, both the hydrodynamic models and the wet granular flow approach show considerable promise for the task, due to recent increases in computer power and improved models and algorithms. Of these two approaches, the hydrodynamic models are the more mature, but the wet granular flow approach has the advantage of being based explicitly on particle motion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jenkins, D."],"dc:date":"1992","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Bloor and D B Ingham.

The results suggest that the simplest mechanisms are not the cause of the problem, but combinations of these simple mechanisms might well be the cause. The results and discussion indicate some experiments that would be useful in a further study of the problem, and data from the drilling operations that should be kept for further analysis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Benjamin, B.","Whiten, B."],"dc:date":"1994","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":17969,"sim:weight":0.33397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383227,"sim:weight":0.314889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734349,"sim:weight":0.314038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931561,"sim:weight":0.304113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4872629,"sim:weight":0.293863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.287338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890288,"sim:weight":0.285459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269933,"sim:weight":0.270217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43103,"sim:weight":0.26433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.260389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.260389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.260389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.260389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.260389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.260389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.260389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.260389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.255105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25850,"sim:weight":0.253419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":878358,"sim:weight":0.249289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Amcor, a Melbourne-based producer of packaging, pulp and paper products, proposed the initial problem of explaining the large discrepancies which were sometimes observed between the nominal thickness, as determined by hard platen measurements, and the effective thickness which would account for the experimentally measured values of bending stiffness. The question was also raised as to whether or not ultrasonic waves could be used to measure directly, and on-line, the effective thickness.\r\n\r\nPaper can be regarded as a fibre-composite material, with a pronounced anisotropy due to the preferential alignment of fibres in the machine direction as a consequence of the manufacturing process. The salient features of elastic (ultrasonic) wave propagation in an anisotropic plate will be presented, with an emphasis on addressing the questions raised above. In particular, it will be noted that the characterization of the first anti-symmetric (flexural) mode should provide a convenient on-line measurement of the flexural stiffness, which is the more relevant property for quality control and structural design than the effective thickness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rose, F."],"dc:date":"1994","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

To increase productivity it is desirable to select trees that grow quickly and give high yields of top quality timber. Nevertheless it is important to maintain genetic diversity in the breeding population and thereby retain a robust capacity to adapt to changing environmental factors.

Heat satisfies a linear conduction equation and is found to rapidly penetrate the grain.\r\n\r\n2. Moisture satisfies a non-linear diffusion equation, and is found to penetrate the grain more slowly than heat. The more sophisticated moisture diffusion model is solved by numerical and analytic techniques for spherical and ellipsoidal grains.\r\nA vital role is played in the moisture diffusion model by the concept of the mean action time for wetting a grain.\r\nThese first two models are used to determine sensitivity to key cooking parameters, and to calculate the degree of over-cook in the existing batch steam process. Recommendations are made for improving and speeding up the cooking process.\r\nThe last two models are modifications of the nonlinear moisture penetration model 2. above. The results of these improved models have the potential to provide finer adjustments to estimates of wetting times.\r\n\r\n3. A cereal grain swells significantly during wetting. A model that takes this into account is developed and solved approximately.\r\n\r\n4. Another wetting model describes the effect of the gelatinisation reaction, slowing moisture penetration, and leading to a sharp front entering the grain. The effect of gelatinisation on the speed of moisture penetration is expected to be more important for the present high-temperature cooking process, than when soaking a grain at a lower temperature. This model is also developed and solved approximately.","bibo:AuthorList":["McGowan, P.","McGuiness, M."],"dc:date":"1996","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H S Carslaw and J C Jaeger. (1959).

Important metals like copper and gold are produced by this process. In this report, we study chemical and physical processes in heap leaching in order to gain a better understanding of leach heaps. These processes are complicated, not well supported by data, and generally not well understood. Heap leaching is investigated using a variety of complementary approaches: data analysis, microstructure models of the ore, overall chemical processes, and analysis of fluid motions by continuum and probabilistic methods. A significant finding of our work is that voids in the heap are not full of solution, and further the distribution of leach liquor within the ore is not uniform which decreases the efficiency of the leaching process. We suggest mechanisms by which the uniformity of the leach liquor distribution can be increased, thus increasing the efficiency of the process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barton, N.G.","Wake, G.C."],"dc:date":"1997","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"N Eriksson and G Destouni.

To increase paint production capacity it will be necessary for the company to implement more effective methods of cleaning and waste disposal at the manufacturing site. Paint is a substance composed of resins and pigments which are initially suspended in a mixture of liquid solvents. In this form the paint must be stored in sealed containers to prevent evaporation of volatile solvents. The liquid paint can be applied by brush or spray to a wood or metal surface where it subsequently dries to provide a durable protective coating. The resins are used for surface adhesion, the liquid solvents allow easy application of the paint and are sufficiently volatile to promote quick drying, and the pigments provide colour. Since colour is a particularly important characteristic it is essential that the tanks in which the paint is manufactured are scrupulously cleaned between batches. The cleaning process generates a large amount of liquid waste from which the solvents can be recovered by distillation. Unfortunately the high temperatures normally required to recover the less volatile solvents can result in baking of solid waste onto the walls of the container. In this article we propose a simple model for the distillation process and show that boiling temperatures can be lowered by reducing the pressure in the container. In particular we show that the required pressure reduction can be achieved using a condenser, provided that the heat exchange capacity of the condenser matches the heat exchange capacity of the boiler at the desired boiling temperature. In this way we suggest that baking of solid waste onto the container walls can be avoided. Since both the boiler and the condenser used for this process by Dulux Australia are vacuum rated it may be possible for the company to implement the proposed operation with only minor modifications to the current equipment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Howlett, P.G.","Thompson, C.J."],"dc:date":"1997","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":28024,"sim:weight":0.438024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46943,"sim:weight":0.381739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890288,"sim:weight":0.374371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383230,"sim:weight":0.354171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890825,"sim:weight":0.343631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890336,"sim:weight":0.33329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17994,"sim:weight":0.325528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.324217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4894931,"sim:weight":0.322433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102716,"sim:weight":0.316955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.305273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.305273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.305273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.305273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.305273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.305273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.305273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.305273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.305273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.305273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Its findings were that:\r\n• Modifying the way in which Materials Requirements Planning (MRP) is used may usefully increase autoclave utilisation.\r\n• A single product which will account for 60% of factory hours could and should be scheduled separately.\r\n• It is feasible and very helpful to group products into a small number of sets with common autoclave processing requirements.\r\n• Integer programming models modelling the production line show considerable promise and should be developed further.","bibo:AuthorList":["Panton, D.M.","Beaumont, N."],"dc:date":"1997","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.365061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.364786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.364389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.360575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108408,"sim:weight":0.359612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664656,"sim:weight":0.352475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383077,"sim:weight":0.341649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.339968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.339331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.339331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.339331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.339331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.339331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.339331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.339331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.339331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.339331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.339331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.339331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.339331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The existing ball trajectory models assume that as the ball spins, a layer of air, say a boundary layer, follows the motion of the ball, thus spins with it. This, in turn, induces a velocity difference on the sides normal to ball\u0027s trajectory. The velocity difference then leads to pressure difference due to Bernoulli\u0027s principle. If ω represents the axis of spin and 𝑣 is the linear velocity, the resulting Magnus force would be in the direction of ω×𝑣. Yet, the resulting trajectory models do not seem to account for rapid changes in the trajectories. The study group is then asked to analyse the assumptions of the existing models and modify them if necessary to come up with a satisfactory model.\r\n\r\nIn this study the trajectory of a soccer ball is investigated using a dynamical system that takes the Magnus, drag and gravitational forces into consideration. In particular, close attention is paid to the trajectory of a soccer ball under an initial rotational kick. We first note that balls which are rather smooth, such as the Jabulani, typically hit the critical conditions of the so-called “drag-crisis\" at crucial moments in a game of soccer, such as during a free-kick, so that “knuckling\" is more pronounced. We then propose a simplified system consisting of three ordinary differential equations describing horizontal and vertical acceleration and rotation rate as functions of the forces on the ball, and of its “roughness\". We find that the parameter controlling the roughness to play a critical role in the resulting trajectory. In particular, when this parameter is small, as we assume it to be for soccer balls such as the Jabulani, it is possible for the trajectory to develop two turning points, suggesting that the ball could appear to “bounce\" in mid-flight.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chen, W.","Cor, B.","Konuralp, A.","Reis, T.","Sengul, S."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G K Batchelor.

Continuous fibres, generally about 15 micro m in diameter and made of glass, carbon or kevlar, are embedded in a polymer matrix. The metallic liner is made of a ductile material - generally steel or aluminum alloy.\r\n\r\nAfter the metallic liner has been wrapped, the composite vessel is subjected to a process termed Autofrettage. In that process the vessel is internally pressurized to the point that the ductile metal liner undergoes a small amount of plastic deformation (unlike elastic deformation which disappears upon removal of stress, plastic deformation remains after the stress has been removed). Upon de-pressurization of the vessel, the metallic liner remains under compression and the FRP under tension.\r\n\r\nAcoustic emissions associated with fiber breakage are being developed currently as a non-destructive means of assessing the structural integrity of metal-lined continuous FRP over-wrapped vessels. Laboratory experiments have been carried out with flaws such as cracks and saw cuts of varying dimensions oriented in an axial-radial plane and located in the metallic liner, in the FRP or in both. Pressurization of the flawed vessel leads to fiber breakage, the extent of which is being examined with the intent that it will be a measure of structural integrity of the vessel. The results, however, suggest that the acoustic emissions attain a maximum for an intermediate flaw size. Low emissions are recorded when on the one hand the vessel has insignificant flaws, or on the other if the vessel has serious flaws. This non-monotonic variation of acoustic emission occurs whether the flaws are located in the metallic liner, in the FRP or in both.\r\n\r\nThe experiments suggest that the stress intensity at the discontinuity (crack tip) attains a maximum at an intermediate flaw size. A mathematical corroboration is desired.","bibo:AuthorList":["Westbrook, R."],"dc:date":"1997","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4890291,"sim:weight":0.398086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383227,"sim:weight":0.349838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18081,"sim:weight":0.3436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101430,"sim:weight":0.340811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.338927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664539,"sim:weight":0.334609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43797,"sim:weight":0.325836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101264,"sim:weight":0.325121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.32453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99041,"sim:weight":0.324223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316488,"sim:weight":0.323341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26027,"sim:weight":0.322627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225438,"sim:weight":0.322579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102720,"sim:weight":0.319828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101569,"sim:weight":0.317778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101339,"sim:weight":0.317419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98638,"sim:weight":0.308934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101421,"sim:weight":0.304825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98610,"sim:weight":0.30084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27098,"sim:weight":0.295555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To complete the process of solidification and cool the hot steel, jets of water are sprayed onto the surface of the steel. In this study we consider a two-phase flow model for the heating and vaporisation of the water drops. We concentrate in particular on the non-monotonicity in the measured heat transfer from the steel as a function of the steel temperature. The result of the model is that the vaporisation of a single drop has first to be considered and the resulting behaviour governs the mass and momentum transfer between the two phases. Some simple solutions are then derived for the resulting system of ordinary differential equations.

Most of the services are covered by public health insurance. Patients pay a small fraction of the costs for visits to doctors and hospital treatments. However, due to rising medical costs, declining government funding, and an aging population, the current public health plan will not be able to sustain, and more medical services will be covered by the private sector in the future. It is likely that additional medical insurance will be needed to cover the rising costs, especially for those who will retire in the future.\u003d\u003d\u003dBased on this projection, the presenting company proposes a special medical insurance product, which covers the medical expenses of the clients only after retirement. The main question is, therefore, when an individual should start contribute toward this medical plan after retirement? In other words, if it is necessary to obtain such a plan, should an individual start the plan immediately, wait until he or she retires? If not, is there an optimal time to start contributing and how to determine the amount of the contribution?\u003d\u003d\u003dWe propose several mathematical models which may be used to answer these questions. We will restrict ourselves to an idealized situation by assuming that the premium charged by the insurance will be used only to cover the actual medical expenses. We will neglect other direct and indirect costs as well as the profit.","bibo:AuthorList":["Huang, H."],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

There are three high chimneys in the mill which produce plume pollution and there are a big coal yard and many dusty roofs which produce dust pollution when the sea wind brings the dust up. Unfortunately, the downtown is just located at the downwind direction about 4km away. To reduce the pollution to the downtown, the administrator of Kimitsu works wants to identify the main sources of the pollution then to adopt some methods such as fixing new dust filter on the top of the chimneys or spraying water to the locations where main dust pollution are produced. Some monitoring instruments which are placed somewhere not far from the pollution sources in the downwind direction is used to measure the concentrate of the plume and dust. During three very busy days, we set up some mathematical models for this problem, obtained some initial results and made clear what future work should be done.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tan, Y."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Zibo is also abundant in natural resources. In support of the ceramics industry, they have large reserves of clay, limestone and bauxite. Consequently, there are a number of mines in the region and the outflow of acidic water from these metal and coal mines, known as acid mine drainage (AMD), is considerable. The AMD is rich in sulphate ions and contains other pollutants that are subsequently transferred to the soils and surrounding surface rivers through both irrigation and infiltration of the ground water.\r\n\r\nTo understand the behaviour of the soil in the presence of infiltrating pollutants and atmospheric precipitation, soil-column experiments were performed. A chosen soil sample was undisturbed in the sense that the structure of the soil layers and any pollutants within the column were preserved when the soil was transferred to the experimental apparatus. To simulate the processes that occur within the environment (infiltration and precipitation), polluted water (liquor) from a nearby source was introduced at the top of the column and once this material has infiltrated the column, clean water was allowed to flush through the apparatus. The initial concentration of various ions in the liquor were measured and throughout the experiment, the fluid that reaches the bottom of the column was collected and analysed.\r\n\r\nThe goal for the workshop is to derive a mathematical model that predicts the observed experimental time dependence of the ionic concentrations emerging from the bottom of the the apparatus. Developing the model will require an understanding of the physical and chemical mechanisms of the solute transport though the soil. This is an important first step in the eventual development of remediation schemes for the contaminated soil.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bohun, C.

A typical model of such pricing mechanism is the so-called g-expectation defined by solutions of a backward stochastic differential equation with g as its generating function. Black-Scholes pricing model is a special linear case of this pricing mechanism. We are mainly concerned with two types of pricing mechanisms in an option market: the market pricing mechanism through which the market prices of options are produced, and the ask-bid pricing mechanism operated through the system of market makers. The later one is a typical nonlinear pricing mechanism. Data of prices produced by these two pricing mechanisms are usually quoted in an option market.\r\n\r\nWe introduce a criteria to test if a dynamic pricing mechanism under investigation is a g-pricing mechanism.

In day time hours (convective situations), three over- lapped layers may be distinguished in the lowest part of the atmosphere: the superficial layer, the mixed layer and the entrainment layer. The latter is a thin atmospheric layer that reverses temperature and buffers the up- per free atmosphere. Commonly, atmospheric variables are discontinuous at the entrainment layer. In this approach this latter fact is used to develop a change point analysis for atmospheric measurements. Then, the change point considered in the statistical model is precisely the mixing height. We also discuss the a priori distributions for the parameters in our model and the techniques needed to perform the necessary calculations. Some examples are analysed using data obtained in Texcoco, Mexico.","bibo:AuthorList":["Christen, A.","Salcido, A."],"dc:date":"1995","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":700684,"sim:weight":0.752083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1020829,"sim:weight":0.750608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87520,"sim:weight":0.74854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387412,"sim:weight":0.748534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":522139,"sim:weight":0.746986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1021180,"sim:weight":0.746852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1019883,"sim:weight":0.74257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":971375,"sim:weight":0.741873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1021181,"sim:weight":0.740648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1020666,"sim:weight":0.739111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2691361,"sim:weight":0.738652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":972037,"sim:weight":0.735463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090313,"sim:weight":0.734995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":971362,"sim:weight":0.73389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":884390,"sim:weight":0.731478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":700685,"sim:weight":0.72773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5082399,"sim:weight":0.725577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":889624,"sim:weight":0.725265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109217,"sim:weight":0.724688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98471,"sim:weight":0.724623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This model captures exactly the elliptical velocity profile required in the formulation of the geophysical model from which we obtained exact formulas describing the travel-time through a two layer geological structure, and an exact inversion formula for computing the anisotropic velocity parameter (gamma). A robust numerical method based on a minimization technique was presented as an accurate method of computing both travel-time and the inverted gamma.\r\n\r\nThe exact formulas and robust numerical methods are significant improvements over the approximations and root finding methods discussed in the background material, and we note our formulation is no more difficult than these background methods.\r\n\r\nWe derived asymptotic formulas valid for the near vertical case, which describe accurately the high sensitivity of gamma to the input parameters in this case. Our numerical work also confirms this sensitivity, even using exact formulas and robust numerical methods.\r\n\r\nWe conclude that the computation of the anisotropic velocity parameter (gamma) for the given physical measurements from a series of surface signals and single borehole receiver is intrinsically unstable. By changing to the alpha,beta velocity parameter space, we obtain an inversion method that is much less sensitive to input errors. For certain geophysical problems, the alpha,beta parameters may suffice for an accurate description of the material.\r\n\r\nWhen the anisotropic velocity parameter (gamma) is needed directly, a different measurement technique is required.

A numerical scheme is also developed and simulations carried out for maturation over one day and then two months.

A simple plane strain model of a suddenly loaded fault is analysed to illustrate the possible transition from stable slip behaviour to accelerated, unstable slip. The model assumes that a peaked shear load is applied suddenly to the fault region. The rate of slip movement is assumed to be proportional to the difference between the applied shear stress and the cohesive and frictional slip resistance. It is found that the evolutionary fault movement can be described succinctly by a non-linear ordinary differential equation describing the activated length of the sliding fault as a function of time. The differential equation is found to depend on a single, dimensionless parameter whose value determines whether the fault slip decays monotonically or accelerates in an unstable manner.","bibo:AuthorList":["Napier, J.A.L."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The cost of rail transport can be reduced by improving the placement of containers on trains so that the number of wagons required is minimised and so that the train can be operated safely and efficiently. The cost of terminal operations, and the delays experienced by customers\u0027 trucks, can be reduced by improving the procedures used to load and unload trains.\r\n\r\nWe divided the problem into three subtasks. The first task is to develop a load plan for a train based on the expected mix of containers. An ideal plan specifies positions on the train for various container types in a way that minimises the number of wagons required while meeting a number of packing, safety and aerodynamic constraints. The second task is truck dispatching - when a truck arrives at the terminal, where should it be sent? This problem is not straightforward because trucks arrive randomly and loading and unloading occur simultaneously, and so the ideal position for a container may not yet be available. The third task is to dispatch the stackers that transfer containers between trains and trucks in such a way that truck waiting time is minimised.\r\n\r\nThe train planning problem can be formulated as an integer programming problem, but it can also be solved using the OASIS software already owned by National Rail Corporation. Train plans can be made more flexible by using container classes rather than specific container details.\r\n\r\nThe study group suggested several truck dispatch schemes, but did not have sufficient data to evaluate the schemes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ernst, A.","Pudney, P."],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E A Cornish and R A Fischer.

In particular WMC Resources Ltd has operations world wide looking for just that edge in the detection of very large deposits of, for example, gold. Since the pioneering work of Mandelbrot, geologists have been familiar with the concept of fractals and self similarity over a few orders of magnitude for geological features. This includes the location and size of deposits within a particular mineral province. Fractal dimensions have been computed for such provinces and similarities of these aggregated measures between provinces have been noted. This paper explores the possibility of making use of known information to attempt the inverse process. That is, from lesser dimensional measures of a mineral province, for example, fractal dimension or more generally multi-fractal measures, is it possible to infer, even with small increase in probability, where the unknown (preferably large) deposits might be located.","bibo:AuthorList":["Broadgate, M.","Cheng, Q.","Hayward, N.","Jennings, L."],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"F P Agterberg.

High explosives are inherently dangerous and their detonation can be triggered by low velocity impacts with speeds in the range of 10 to 70 m/s . The kinetic energy associated with impact is converted into thermal energy within the explosive, potentially leading to thermal runaway and detonation. The study group was asked to investigate the mechanisms generating heat and detonation in an explosive HMX, based on the compression of a sample of the explosive. The study group identified frictional heating in localized shear bands as the most likely mechanism for heat generation in the compression of both HMX and other high explosives formed from a granular material within a polymer bonding. The study group also considered the squeezing of explosive samples for a range of more general rheologies and investigated possible improvements to the numerical modelling already conducted by AWE.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hicks, P.","Hall, C."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J E Balzer, J E Field, M J Gifford, W G Proud and S M Walley.

The complex devices now being developed for biological applications involving the analysis of DNA (in genetics and genomics) and proteins (in proteomics) and bio-defense typically involve aqueous solutions and channels 30 to 300 μm in diameter. Unlike microelectronics, in which the current emphasis is on reducing the size of transistors, microfluidics is focusing on making more complex systems of channels with more sophisticated fluid-handling capabilities, rather than reducing the size of the channels. Although micro- and macro-fluidic systems require similar components including pumps, valves, mixers, filters, and separators, the small size of microchannels causes their flow to behave differently. At micron scales, fluid motions are primarily dominated by surface tension and viscous forces.\r\n\r\nIn the problem under consideration, the issue is one of wicking or leaking of the sample from the reaction reservoir to the waste region at elevated temperatures. A mechanism responsible for this phenomenon was thought to be the \"wedge effect,\" which refers to the tendency of liquids to move along a sharp corner by capillary effects if the conditions are right. The analysis performed during the workshop also mainly focused on this effect.\r\n\r\nWhile a definitive solution to this challenging problem posed in the workshop was not identified, it was felt that using a manufacturing process that can affect the corner angles in the channels may hold the most promise, allowing the wicking mechanism to be controlled without surface treatments that insert hydrophobic stops in the channel. For instance by \"rounding\" the side walls to increase the corner angles from 90 toward 180 degrees, the leaking of the sample away\r\nfrom the reaction chamber might be delayed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Daneshbod, Yousef","Kominiarczuk, Jakub","Kreykes, Jason","Nadim, Ali"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Norbury, G C Sander and C F Scott.

Para lograr este control es necesario medir apropiadamente la temperatura de la carga, lo que se debe normalmente realizar sin contacto (ya que la carga se traslada dentro del horno, a veces a velocidades considerables). La solución tecnológica actual consiste en utilizar pirómetros infrarrojos (instrumentos que miden la radiación en el infrarrojo que sale de la superficie de la carga en cierta dirección dada, habitualmente en un intervalo de longitudes de onda fijo, e infieren la temperatura de la superficie a partir de ella).\r\nEsta solución dista mucho de ser óptima, por varios motivos. Uno, la radiación que sale de la superficie no es sólo radiación emitida por la superficie (que testimonia su temperatura) sino radiación reflejada desde otros puntos de la cavidad del horno. Esta radiación reflejada en muchos casos puede ser mucho más intensa que la emitida (por razones de productividad la temperatura del horno es normalmente superior a la temperatura de la carga). En segundo lugar, las propiedades ópticas de las superficies que son relevantes para esta técnica (emisividad, por ejemplo) están habitualmente mal caracterizadas y dependen mucho del estado superficial de la carga que en muchos casos es incontrolable.\r\nLa tecnología actual ha desarrollado mucho estos instrumentos, hasta el punto en que es posible medir simultáneamente la radiación proveniente de varios puntos diferentes, en varios intervalos de longitud de onda distintos.\r\nLa propuesta de este trabajo consiste en pensar cuál es la promesa de estos instrumentos mejorados para la medición de temperatura; hallar, si es posible, configuraciones de distintas direcciones de vista/distintas longitudes de onda que proporciones mediciones más precisas, robustas, etc.\r\nDesde el punto de vista técnico, trabajar exitosamente con este problema involucraría hacer / perfeccionar modelos de los intercambios de radiación dentro de una cavidad con superficies a distintas temperaturas y con distintas propiedades ópticas; realizar análisis de sensibilidad de los parámetros que se desee medir respecto de las perturbaciones (tanto de temperaturas y propiedades de las superficies como ‘errores de\r\nmodelización’).","bibo:AuthorList":["Solanes, Jorge","Etcheverry, Javier"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The critical problem is the representation of a signal using a small number of computable functions, such that it is represented in a concise and computationally efficient form. It is shown that wavelets are closely related to filter banks (sub band filtering) and that there is a direct analogy between multiresolution analysis in continuous time and a filter bank in discrete time. This provides a clear physical interpretation of the approximation and detail spaces of multiresolution analysis in terms of the frequency bands of a signal. Only orthogonal wavelets, which are derived from orthogonal filter banks, are discussed. Several examples and applications are considered.","bibo:AuthorList":["Winkler, J.R."],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Aldroubi and M Unser. (1996).

The name of the problem derives from the fact that on its passage down the production line the tow passes through a J-shaped box, whose purpose is to provide a buffer where the tow is stored long enough and hot enough for certain chemical reactions to take place, mainly concerned with giving the right quality to the fibre surface. (The production line in fact involves two J-boxes, one containing wet tow, the other dry, and we are here entirely concerned with the first of these, the wet J-box.) \r\n\r\nThree aspects of the tow behaviour were proposed for investigation:\r\n1. What is the mechanical behaviour of the tow within the J-box ? Specifically, how do the time spent within the J-box and the shape of the tow outlet column depend on the J- box geometry, tow density and compressibility, flow rate, friction coefficients etc.\r\n2. What is the temperature history, and hence the chemical history, of the tow within the J-box?\r\n3. Why do dislocations and loops occur within the tow?\r\n\r\nWe first give typical parameters and other details of the process, and then further details of these three questions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Please, C.P.","Jones, M.","Allwright, D.J."],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(1950).

This analysis is aimed at explaining a 1% inaccuracy in the oscillator frequency under test conditions prescribed by a leading supplier of semi-conductor devices. During the test the package containing the oscillator was clamped to a circuit board by mechanical pressure. By considering the nature of the oscillator we show that tensile strains of the order of 10^-4 could explain the observations via the piezoresistance effect. Both a simple one-dimensional analysis based on the beam equation and an elastic finite element simulation show that strains of this magnitude can be generated during the test.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ward, J.A.","Lapin, V.","Lee, W."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Colin D Simpson.

A fully saturated zone is shown to occur. It is typically a thin layer, relative to the total soil thickness, and lies at the bottom of the soil layer. This provides a bottom boundary condition for the partially saturated upper zone. It is shown that after the onset of rainfall, well-defined fronts of water can descend through the soil layer. Also the rainwater flow is relatively quick compared with the moisture uptake by the roots of the plants in the roof. In a separate model the exchanges of water are described between the (smaller-scale) porous granules of soil, the roots and the rainwater in the inter-granule pores.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hewitt, I.","Lacey, A.A.","Mellgren, N.","Vynnycky, M.","Robinson, M.","Cooker, M."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M T Van Genuchten.

This process requires continuous aeration that may be energy consuming, and the final aim of the study is to identify how the process design can minimize the energy input per mass of treated sludge.

The energy received by the collecting solar panel is then calculated using a specially designed algorithm. The geometry of the device collecting the energy may then be optimised using different algorithms. The results show that for a given depth, devices of smaller width are more energy efficient than those of wider dimensions.

SOLA Optical asked the MISG to investigate this process as a means of applying a protective coating to spectacle lenses. The theory, as proposed by the group, involves the \u0027lubrication\u0027 form of the equations of slow viscous flow. This yields an estimate of the wet coating thickness variation, which in turn depends on the liquid properties, the pull rate, and the lens curvature. When this thickness is reduced by the volatile fraction of the coating, predicted thicknesses are in rough agreement with reported values. Once applied, the liquid film drains downward and this effect is modelled numerically. An outline of a more complete model, allowing evaporation and drying, is also presented.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schwartz, L.","White, L."],"dc:date":"1994","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Warkworth Mining is seeking to reduce the dust emissions caused by the dumping of raw coal at their facility in Singleton, NSW. The suggested strategy was the construction of windbreaks, for which commercial designs exist. The MISG was asked to advise on the placement and design of such windbreaks.\r\n\r\nThe problem was approached by studying results in the literature on windbreak design, selecting a few possible configurations, and then testing these by solving numerically for the wind velocity around the dumping site. It was concluded that a long fence on the upwind side of the dumping hoppers would provide moderate protection, but would interfere with current operating procedures. As a better option, a long downwind fence immediately behind the hoppers would provide a similar reduction in the dust emission, and allow more effective use of water sprays. Although fine details of the fence design could not be modelled numerically, we concluded that it was desirable for the fence to have an angled overhang in the vicinity of the hoppers, and a porous section near the base to reduce turbulent flows.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chan, D.","Zhu, Z."],"dc:date":"1995","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A model is proposed that locates the freeze point as that point where the unfavourable energy due to wetting of the PVC by water is dominated by the energy required to compress the gel network inside the droplets.

The desired profile varies depending on the future use of the optical fiber, but a standard profile is a simple parabola.\r\n\r\nThe actual profile in an optical fiber does not match the desired profile due to the way in which optical fibers are manufactured. A glass blank is spun on a lathe while a flame that is fed an appropriate level of silica and Ge02 moves rapidly back and forth along the cane. Soot from the flame is deposited on the spinning blank. Naturally the deposition will create spiral patterns of doping on the cane. This creates oscillations in the level of Ge02, and therefore in the desired refractive index. Because soot is being deposited at a constant volumetric rate, the wavelength of the oscillation decreases as the radius of the cane increases. The flame travels up and back along the cane in each layer, so the layer structure has two local maxima in each full oscillation.\r\n\r\nBecause the oscillatory behavior of n(r) is unimportant in the final product, Corning asked to determine a way to remove the noise in the measurements of n(r) caused by the oscillations, and determine the background profile.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bourland, J."],"dc:date":"1995","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26743,"sim:weight":0.435705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2183574,"sim:weight":0.376576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99111,"sim:weight":0.376523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.374429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890329,"sim:weight":0.371897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54114,"sim:weight":0.364271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4894931,"sim:weight":0.36407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44673,"sim:weight":0.347517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890296,"sim:weight":0.344387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.34257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890288,"sim:weight":0.342548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23197,"sim:weight":0.342518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268391,"sim:weight":0.340013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43385,"sim:weight":0.337316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71065,"sim:weight":0.332992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.332838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186392,"sim:weight":0.331658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29436,"sim:weight":0.328544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101235,"sim:weight":0.32816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271192,"sim:weight":0.319863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Due to these oscillations, a small gap opens and closes between the collar of a journal bearing and the axle box many times every second. The forces between these components reach peaks of over 10 tonnes. This is an environment in which wear of the soft spherical graphite iron of the axle box will eventually take place.\r\n\r\nDue to repeated unloadings of the weight on the bearing during oscillations, the bearing collar may slowly slip against the axle box wall. Although our calculations show that abrasive wear due to this slippage is negligible, the calculation raises general principles that apply to other possible wear mechanisms. If lifetime is proportional to hardness, we can estimate relative lifetimes of refurbished and new boxes. Although the resleeve material is softer than the original, the cost to lifetime ratio would favour refurbishment under this assumption.\r\n\r\nImportant unanswered questions are identified and a specific integrated program of field, laboratory, and theoretical study is suggested.","bibo:AuthorList":["Broadbridge, P.","Wake, G."],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Hanselman and B Little£ield.

There is a problem with the reliability of the feeders, particularly for thicker castings of the newer spheroidal graphite irons. An effective feeder remains molten until the casting has set. The setting of the melt in the feeder is delayed by making it large enough to retain its heat for longer than the casting, and by placing it close to the thermal centre of the casting. So a larger feeder is more reliable. But any metal remaining in the feeder is recycled, and has an associated energy cost. If a feeder is too small, it will set too soon, and the casting will have unwanted holes in it that may require the entire casting to be recycled. Thus there is a tension between making the feeder smaller so as to minimise recycled metal, and having the feeder large enough that the casting is good.\r\n\r\nExisting design methods use purely conductive models of heat transport. We investigate the relevance of convection in the cooling feeder, and set up a boundary-layer model of flow driven by density differences. We find that convection is a significant factor in the design of a feeder, effectively maintaining constant temperature across it. The height of the feeder is important mainly in providing the driving force for this flow.","bibo:AuthorList":["McGuinness, M.J.","Roberts, A.J."],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A C Fowler.

It concludes that some assumptions in the existing algorithm are overly restrictive, while, overall, this is an effective tracking method.

An investigation of the classical plane strain gravitational problem in a purely elastic medium shows that any fractures due to gravitational effects alone would occur at the base of the tunnel rather than the apex. Ignoring gravity we then explore an elastic/plastic solution in an idealized soil with no cohesion. To simulate the action of the TBM a point source is imparted on the medium extending in the horizontal direction. This model decouples into an elastostatic problem that predicts a wedge shaped region of plasticity extending from the point source and a hyperbolic flow problem in the plasticized region. Using a similarity solution, it is shown that the behaviour of the medium is very sensitive to the parameters that characterize the soil.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bohun, C.

The problem presented by Tegel was specifically to model the energy exchange between the chickens and their shed environment in order to better understand and control the shed climate and thereby maximize growth rate.\n\nA model for the heat production and water respiration rate of a typical chicken was developed, based on physical principles. A thermodynamical model of the whole chicken+shed system included the temperature of the external air, the internal air, the chickens, the litter, the concrete floor and the underlying soil. It also included the relative humidity (RH) of the external and internal air and the water flows into and out of the shed. \n\nModelling of the shed environment’s inputs and outputs will be particularly valuable for continuing assessment of three fundamental inputs of economic importance: feed nutrient density in terms of energy formulation, heating in terms of gas/power usage, and heat removal via extraction fans.

The aim is to maximise the number of boxes packed. The decision must be made after all information is known, but before the fruit passes the first outlet - a few seconds total. Further, information about fruit already packed in a given box is incomplete (we don’t know exactly which fruit ended up in a box). \n\nThe bagging problem requires bags to be filled to a minimum weight - no tolerance for underweights, and no constraints on the number of fruit per bag. In this case complete information is available on fruit already assigned to a bag.

The SWRCB demands a testing procedure that includes conditions as close to operational as possible, while still using environmentally safe gases as a test fluid. Although the test parameters (e.g., pressure) are allowed to deviate from operating conditions in order to facilitate the test procedure, a prescribed rescaling of the test thresholds must then be applied to account for the deviation. Whether the test is run at operation conditions or in a slightly different parameter regime, the fact that the testing must be done on the product and return lines after installation at a service station presents significant challenges in devising an effective test strategy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bader, Laura","Billingham, John","Callahan, Daniel","Catrina, Florin","Edwards, David","Fehribach, Joseph","Gemmrich, Simon","Hazaveh, Kamyar","Johnson, Katharine","Moore, Richard","Mykrantz, Andrew","Ni, Peng","Phillips, Joel","Tilley, Burt","Ware, Kimberly","Weekes, Suzanne"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G K Batchelor.

{"identifier":6183035,"ep:Repository":70,"dc:type":["Study Group Report","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The dynamics of liquid slugs forced by a syringe pump","bibo:abstract":"Microfluidic processes for chemical synthesis have become popular in recent years. The small scale of the chemical reactions promise greater control over reaction conditions and more timely creation of products. The small scale of microfluidics poses its own set of problems, however. At the microscale, the dominant fluid forces are viscous resistance and surface tension. The effects of viscosity and scale reduce the Reynolds number and make mixing difficult. Much work has been done to control mixing at the microscale.\r\n\r\nThis problem is concerned with a different microfluidic problem: delivering reactants to the site of reaction. A common setup is to attach syringes full of reactant to a reaction chamber by narrow hydrophobic tubing. Using a stepper motor, a controlled dose of liquid may be injected into the tube. The hydrophobosity causes the dose to curve outward on the sides, becoming a \"slug\" of reactant with air in front and behind. The syringe at the rear is then switched for one full of air, and air pressure is used to drive the slug to the reaction site.\r\n\r\nIf too much pressure is applied, the slug will arrive with a significant back pressure that will be relieved through bubbling in the reaction site. This causes the formation of a foam and is highly undesirable. We present a simple model based on Boyle’s law for the motion of a slug through a tube. We then extend this model for trains of slugs separated by air bubbles. Last, we consider the case of a flooded reaction site, where the forward air bubble must be pushed through the flooding liquid.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we have determined the dynamics of a single slug moving towards an empty reaction chamber giving the final equilibrium position of the slug. A phase-plane analysis then determined a condition on the size of the slug needed to ensure that it comes to rest without oscillating about the equilibrium position. The effect of a flooded reaction chamber was then considered. In this case it is impossible to avoid bubbling due to the design of the device. We found that it is possible, however, to reduce the bubbling by minimising the back pressure behind the slug. Finally, the dynamics of multiple slugs with or without a flooded reaction chamber has been investigated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miraghaie, Reza","Abouali, M.","Breward, C.","Chan, I.","Ellis, A.","Fehribach, J.","Gratton, M.

This alignment is necessary for the final mechanical properties of the fiber. After leaving the spinning hole, the fluid passes through a layer of air (the \"air gap\") and enters a bath, in which it solidifies almost instantaneously. Somewhere inside this bath, the fiber is being drawn by a wheel, which delivers the force, necessary for the stretching process.\r\n\r\nWhen the speed of the drawing wheel is set to high, it is impossible to obtain a uniform fiber: one clearly observes variations in the fiber diameter. This phenomenon is called draw resonance. Experimental evidence suggests that the draw ratio, that is, the ratio between the speeds at the wheel and at the exit of the spinning hole, is the unique parameter to steer the onset of draw resonance, and for Newtonian fluids this is known to be true. In the Newtonian case, the onset of draw resonance can be shown to be a Hopf bifurcation.\r\n\r\nThe question, asked to the Study Group, was to extend the results on Newtonian fluids to fluids with more general rheologies, with power law fluids as a first choice. What came out of the Study Group was not yet a final solution to this problem, but rather an attempt to come to an easier formulation of the model equations. At the workshop, we thought that we had succeeded, but afterwards we found that there was a hidden mistake, which we could not easily correct. This mistake in itself is worth mentioning, because the approach we tried may be successful in other cases, and this mistake may easily slip into the considerations there. In this note, we restrict ourselves to the Newtonian case, because it is easy to describe the mistake in this setting, and the power law setting would not add anything.\r\n\r\nAs a final remark, we note that the \"power law case\" has been solved now, by using similar methods as we did in the Newtonian case.

This is mainly because of its concentrated and contactless energy supply. This has led to many applications in the domain of laser materials processing. The most important applications in this domain are cutting, welding and marking. Laser drilling, the topic of this article, is a niche application.\r\n\r\nLaser percussion drilling (drilling by multiple shots) is for instance used in the process of gas turbine manufacturing, because of the fact that the components to be drilled are made of superalloys which are very hard to machine by conventional techniques. To fix ideas, the typical hole diameter, hole depth and pulse length are 0.5 : 1.0 mm, 3 : 10 mm and 1.0 ms, respectively. Laser percussion drilling is favoured over alternative drilling processes like spark erosion drilling and laser trepanning drilling because it is by far the fastest process.However, it suffers of problems with the quality of the hole. The main quality aspects are:\r\n\r\n- Tapering (Decrease of hole diameter with depth)\r\n- Recast layer (Re-solidified material at wall of hole)\r\n- Bellow shape (Local increase of hole diameter)\r\n\r\nThe laser drilling process depends on the material properties and on the laser beam characteristics: wavelength and intensity as a function of space and time.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the research being started at the study group is to come up with a simulation model based on a mathematical model which includes all relevant physical features. This model is needed to get a better understanding of the process and to be able to select proper settings of the process parameters. Once well validated, this model will be used to define the specification of the ideal laser used for drilling.

{"identifier":6183092,"ep:Repository":70,"dc:type":["Study Group Report","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Temperature and Moisture Gradients in Sugar Silos","bibo:abstract":"Danisco Sugar is the main sugar producer in Denmark. The sugar is extracted from sugar beets which are harvested during the beet campaign September -- December. The refined sugar is stored in huge silos and withdrawn on a regular, but not constant, basis for distribution until the next campaign. Danisco Sugar utilizes several types of silos for the storage of crystalline sugar. They differ in construction material e.g. concrete or steel plate silos, dimension, design with or without a central tower and isolation. Various methods of filling and emptying are utilized, that is first in - last out, or first in - first out. The silos are equipped with one or more facilities for sugar conditioning. Those includes temperature control of walls, control of the condition of the air space above sugar, ability to blow conditioned air through the bulk sugar etc.\r\n\r\nA number of problems arise when storing sugar for long periods. Due to distribution of heat and moisture the sugar can `cake\u0027 or harden and moist sugar is difficult to empty from the silos. The chemical and microbial stability of the sugar is influenced by the temperature and moisture distribution. On the other hand under very dry conditions there is a risk of dust explosions. The object is to control the temperature and moisture content within a lower and an upper limit. Danisco Development Centre wishes to employ mathematical modelling as a tool for understanding and predicting temperature and moisture distribution in sugar stored in silos.\r\n\r\nIn moisture migration the physical processes which have to be taken into account are diffusion in the porous bulk sugar, natural convection due to temperature gradients, forced convection due to bulk sugar air conditioning, conditioning of the air above the bulk sugar and migration of moisture through concrete silo walls. The temperature distribution is influenced by seasonal variations, the temperature of the air space above the bulk sugar, remixing processes when filling and emptying silos, air conditioning and others. The following physical properties are assumed of importance when formulating models to describe the formation of temperature and moisture gradients: bulk sugar heat capacity, heat conductivity, density, porosity, tortuosity and sorption isotherms. Most will vary with the sugar quality (that is: crystal size, reducing sugar content and ash content), some with temperature and moisture.\r\n\r\nMathematical models for moisture and heat conduction in stored cereal grains have previously been developed. In modelling moisture and heat conduction in sugar our starting point is to use the approach applied in modelling moisture and heat conduction in grain and adopt the model to the case of stored sugar, including the possibility of air conditioning.\r\n\r\nIn our modelling carried out during the week of the Study Group, we used a number of simplifying assumptions, such as air flow through the sugar being dominated by forced, and constant, convection, and having processes happening fast enough, so that local equilibrium holds. (Estimates obtained at the time indicated that the temperature varies very little over the length scale of the sugar grains and their interstices.)","bibo:AuthorList":["Lacey, Andrew","Sorensen, Mads Peter"],"dc:date":"1998","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":597486,"sim:weight":0.294592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664603,"sim:weight":0.237559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17994,"sim:weight":0.218099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385638,"sim:weight":0.215553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108096,"sim:weight":0.200756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146045,"sim:weight":0.199584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99369,"sim:weight":0.184124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383230,"sim:weight":0.180422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18159,"sim:weight":0.177965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108706,"sim:weight":0.16437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.1588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.1588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225444,"sim:weight":0.156334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385947,"sim:weight":0.155825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.15056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.15056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.15056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.15056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.15056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.15056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
