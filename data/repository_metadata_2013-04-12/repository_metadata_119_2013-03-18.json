Artistic activities are highlighted as a viaticum for people’s creativity, hence for their potential significance in influencing development in any sector or region. These prospects are positioned in an analysis of transnational corporations, uneven economic development, choices over globalisation and regional competitiveness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sacchetti, Silvia","Sugden, Roger"],"dc:date":"2007-08-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":65723,"sim:weight":0.238027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9847,"sim:weight":0.228369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.211518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46821,"sim:weight":0.206432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77832,"sim:weight":0.196171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631458,"sim:weight":0.193186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66889,"sim:weight":0.18595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8254,"sim:weight":0.179388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.179084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.178768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106035,"sim:weight":0.175312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632272,"sim:weight":0.174792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76011,"sim:weight":0.171081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666006,"sim:weight":0.169125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10761,"sim:weight":0.168433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.162938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.162938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.162938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.162938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.162938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The alluvium of the Ouse forms the limit to the north, and westwards the deposits of the River Went can be traced beneath the Turnbrigg Dyke, a diversion of the Don of mediaeval or earlier construction. The present surface of the Moors, after peat cutting, lies at about 2 m. O.D. \n \nThe canals area, east of the now defunct Thorne Moorends Colliery, has a very diverse acid bog flora and several uncommon species from the fen environment survive on the edges of the warplands.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buckland, P.

The data includes documentary analysis, official statistics, interviews and surveys with staff and students. Enjoyment of school tends to be promoted by factors such as successful social relationships, small classes, variation in learning, and students having some control of their learning. Enjoyment tends to be inhibited by perceived lack of respect or concern by teaching staff and passive pedagogy. For some disengaged students, a work or college environment with more adult relationships appears to restore enjoyment and enthusiasm. Enjoyment, unlike attainment for example, is not particularly stratified by the standard student background variables. Nor is there evidence of a clear school effect. This means that enjoyment should be easy to enhance more widely, positively affecting the learner identities of all young people, including the more reluctant learners.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gorard, Stephen","See, Beng Huat"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Barber and M Moursched.

We present a model that embodies a hybrid of two very different neural network architectures inside an animat: one that controls their high level deliberative behaviours, such as the selection of sub-goals, and one that provides reactive and navigational capabilities. Animats using this model are evolved in novel and dynamic environments, on complex tasks requiring deliberative behaviours: tasks that cannot be solved by reactive mechanisms alone and which would traditionally have their solutions formulated in terms of search-based planning. Significantly, no a priori information is given to the animats, making explicit forward search through state transitions impossible. The complexity of the problem means that animats must first learn to solve sub-goals without receiving any reward. Animats are shown increasingly complex versions of the task, with the results demonstrating, for the first time, incremental neuro-evolutionary learning on such tasks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Robinson, Edward","Ellis, Timothy","Channon, Alastair"],"dc:date":"2007-09-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":12338,"sim:weight":0.325498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.291557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26952,"sim:weight":0.281508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934278,"sim:weight":0.261009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.253926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934499,"sim:weight":0.241808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The dominant goal of a knowledge society in advanced countries, however, has prompted a weak debate on the pressures that originate from this new paradigm at local level and on the inequalities it generates. The variables that intervene to shape and steer local economic development (LED) in the knowledge-based economy are here considered in order to build a general framework of analysis. The proposed analytical framework for LED recognises the importance of six dimensions: contextualisation, expectations, timeliness, capabilities, interdependencies and inclusion. It is argued that a crucial policy dimension stems from the several asymmetries that may arise with regard to the different capabilities of the involved local actors (firms, institutions, individuals) vis-à-vis the cumulative advantage dynamics of knowledge and technology. A problematic issue, raised by means of a cross-country comparison between the US and Italy, pertains to the exclusion of “disadvantaged actors” (small firms and low-skilled individuals) in technology-based development programs. It is also argued that inequalities in terms of access to technology risk to hinder governance-based processes in local development. To this end, a countervailing investment in deliberative forms of democracy would require a policy path that aims at reducing LED disequilibria by means of an adaptive, democratic and creative process of learning. Implications for a future comparative research agenda among localities are introduced with regard to this perspective. \n \n \nKeywords \nLocal economic development; knowledge economy; governance; tech-based development; inequality","bibo:AuthorList":["Ciapetti, Lorenzo"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9847,"sim:weight":0.311936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.309236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.284387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.284387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.284387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.284387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.284387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.284387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.284387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.284387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.284387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.284387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.284387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.284387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.284387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.284387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.280845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76011,"sim:weight":0.279009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77832,"sim:weight":0.278205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10761,"sim:weight":0.27365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Motivation for considering a second order originates in Belnap’s four-valued logic. The infinitary connections of the two orders are based on a set of axioms which are derived from the Stone duality for bitopological spaces. In this paper it is shown that the axioms given by Jung and Moshier contain some previously unknown redundancies. The redundancies yield an isomorphism of two categories, one having special Scott domains as objects and the other a certain type of complete lattice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Klinke, Olaf"],"dc:date":"2008-10-28","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"N D Belnap.

Human society might one day treat a type of robot or computing system as an artificial person. Yet that would not answer scientific questions about the machine’s consciousness or otherwise. Indeed, empirical tests for consciousness are impossible because no such entity is denoted within the theoretical structure of the science of mind, i.e. psychology. However, contemporary experimental psychology can identify if a specific mental process is conscious in particular circumstances, by theory-based interpretation of the overt performance of human beings. Thus, if we are to build a conscious machine, the artificial systems must be used as a test-bed for theory developed from the existing science that distinguishes conscious from non-conscious causation in natural systems. Only such a rich and realistic account of hypothetical processes accounting for observed input/output relationships can establish whether or not an engineered system is a model of consciousness. It follows that any research project on machine consciousness needs a programme of psychological experiments on the demonstration systems and that the programme should be designed to deliver a fully detailed scientific theory of the type of artificial mind being developed – a Psychology of that Machine.","bibo:AuthorList":["Booth, David A."],"dc:date":"2004-05","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"I Aleksander.

It was first designed and written in the 1990s by Graeme Douglas and Alan Gamble and then updated in 2000 and is now available as freeware. \r\n \r\nThe programme was specially designed to meet the needs of visually impaired people (in particular children and young people). For example, it provides the means to set up different colours, dimensions and fonts for the exercise text displayed, and has speech capability. These features make it possible for Touch Typing Tutor to be operated independently by the learner. This program is easy to use, with a full set of touch typing exercises supplied. Additional exercises can easily be created using any text editor which is capable of writing plain ASCII files (e.g. the Windows \u0027Notepad\u0027), and organised into lessons. This means that you are able to use Touch Typing Tutor to teach according to the scheme of your choice - no particular approach is built into the program itself - even replacing the entire suite of lessons with your own if you wish. \r\n \r\nThe software has been used extensively in the UK as well as other parts of the world (particularly Africa).","bibo:AuthorList":["Douglas, Graeme","Gamble, Alan"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99101,"sim:weight":0.404648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99358,"sim:weight":0.388435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82345,"sim:weight":0.385927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17914,"sim:weight":0.377542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269918,"sim:weight":0.372308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45883,"sim:weight":0.356198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.347079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99217,"sim:weight":0.341827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.33196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.328527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.321254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933571,"sim:weight":0.31947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933572,"sim:weight":0.31947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.317776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.307617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381994,"sim:weight":0.306397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101522,"sim:weight":0.298022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.290484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352163,"sim:weight":0.288208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44568,"sim:weight":0.260987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":103629,"ep:Repository":119,"dc:type":["Article","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Measuring social identity in the professional context of provision for pupils with special needs.","bibo:abstract":"The educational inclusion of pupils with special, or additional, educational needs is being promoted internationally. One would expect that professionals for whom the group identity as ‘special professional’ is both important and perceived as being under threat, would only be supportive of inclusion if it could be orchestrated in a way which fosters that identity. This paper provides a review of the research literature concerning social group identification and perceived threat with particular reference to out-group derogation, perception of group structure and in-group affirming behaviour. This review provides the context for findings from a scale about social identity (devised for this research) concerning an e mail group oriented to professionals working with children with special needs (N\u003d105). The survey identified three social identity factors (perceived typicality, public reference to the group and identification with prototypical group members). High (compared with low) e mail group message senders were less likely to see themselves as typical of workers in the field but more likely to identify with SEN as a group. The work has conceptual interest in that it supports recent theorising in social identity, and in an area for which there is a need for a greater variety of studies having good ecological validity. The work also has considerable relevance as an example of the possible application of psychological theories to the special needs context of fostering effective change concerning inclusion and integration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lewis, Ann","Crisp, Richard J"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"V L Allen and D A Wilder.

EThOS will also establish workable and standards-based procedures for populating e-thesis repositories with current and retrospectively-acquired digital versions of theses and associated metadata. These developments must also fit with universities’ own internal administrative arrangements and regulations.

{"identifier":103639,"ep:Repository":119,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Community-based approaches to peacebuilding in conflict-affected and fragile contexts","bibo:abstract":"The impact of violent conflict and fragility on a country’s society, economy and political governance is devastating and encompassing. The effects can be tangible and visible, including killed and injured civilians, destroyed or derelict bridges and wells, and damaged or inadequate health and education facilities. They can also be intangible, such as the collapse of state institutions, mistrust in government, the destruction of social relationships, psychological trauma and pervasive fear. Addressing both types of effects are essential in conflict-affected and fragile contexts. \n \nThe ‘community’ has often proven to be resilient in such contexts, providing survival and coping mechanisms for insecurity and fragility. Experience has shown that even in areas of sheer desolation, social life and organisational systems can readily re-emerge within community networks. (Pouligny, 2005) Growing attention has thus been paid in recent years to the adoption of community-based approaches to help address the extensive needs in conflict-affected and fragile contexts. Fragile contexts are situations in which ‘state structures lack political will and/or capacity to provide the basic functions needed for poverty reduction, development and to safeguard the security and human rights of their population’. (OECD DAC, 2007) Conflict-affected contexts encompass situations prior to, during and after armed conflict. \n \nThis paper explores the rationale behind community-based approaches; and key issues, challenges and considerations in designing and implementing such approaches. It highlights overarching issues across sectors and country-contexts, with particular focus on implications specific to conflict-affected and fragile contexts. Section one provides an overview of community-based approaches to peacebuilding, including a brief look at typology and community institutions. Section two outlines the key aims of community-based approaches and how these aims are approached. It also discusses the various challenges in fulfilling these aims and how these challenges can be addressed. Section three highlights key considerations in the planning, execution and monitoring of community-based approaches, including the set up of participatory, community institutions and funding mechanisms. Section four examines issues of sustainability. In particular, it discusses linking community processes to government in order to ensure greater impact and consolidation of community-based interventions. The final section provides an annotated bibliography of specific case studies and evaluations of community-based approaches, highlighting lessons learned and policy recommendations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haider, Huma"],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46592,"sim:weight":0.532298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.448002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.430061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.390144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44822,"sim:weight":0.331127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91023,"sim:weight":0.312703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177155,"sim:weight":0.0869054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The crisis was greatly exacerbated by the behaviour of banks, which has inevitably made the position of any country that has borrowed money worse off. Sub-Saharan Africa was largely insulated from the initial stages of the financial crisis as the majority of the countries in the region are de-linked from the international financial markets. However, with the worsening of the global financial and economic crisis, the region as a whole has now been exposed to the downturn, and growth estimates have been continually lowered from 5 percent in 2008 to 1.7 percent in April 2009 (IMF, 2009). \n \nMany Sub-Saharan African countries are dependent on foreign finance inflows and are even more dependent on commodity based export growth (Naudé, 2009). This has left them particularly exposed to shocks and World Bank economists are warning that although Africa is the least integrated region, it could actually be the worst hit (Devarajan, 2009a). Given that Africa is already the most conflict ridden continent in the world, an exacerbation of resource scarcity could increase conflict across the continent. \nEmerging markets (e.g. South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya) were hit first through their stock exchanges and financial links with other regions in the world; but the crisis has now affected the region\u0027s lower income countries (LICs) through indirect channels and because they are reliant on the stronger regional economies for trade and remittances. \n \nIn addition to financial shocks, Sub-Saharan Africa is also reeling from the food and fuel price shocks of 2007-08. Many countries in the region are already making unsatisfactory progress in their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals; this “triple jeopardy” has thrown millions of households into poverty and will further hinder progress (World Bank, 2009).","bibo:AuthorList":["Bakrania, Shiv","Lucas, Brian"],"dc:date":"2009-07","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Amnesty International.

{"identifier":103641,"ep:Repository":119,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Topic Guide on Communications and Governance","bibo:abstract":"The role of communications in supporting democratic development and stimulating economic growth is an essential part of the so-called ‘good governance’ agenda. However, the available research has been fragmented across multiple disciplines with often conflicting priorities, including political science, communications, media studies, and development studies. There has also been little practical guidance available to policymakers on understanding and using communications in governance reform. \n \nCommunications, and in particular the media, have a great deal of power in influencing governance relationships and processes. Communications are vital for connecting states with societies, facilitating inclusive political systems, giving voice to the poor and marginalised, and enabling citizen participation and social accountability. Communications advocates also argue the strategic use of political communications tools and methodologies can influence the attitudes, opinions and behaviour of key stakeholders and secure the political will necessary for reforms to be successful on the ground. With the recent rise of the fragile states agenda, there has been increased academic and donor interest in how communications can contribute to state-building by improving state citizen relationships and helping to (re)build social contracts in conflict-affected states. \n \nNevertheless, legitimate questions remain regarding the role of donors in supporting communications in pursuit of good governance, not least what type of support is likely to be effective, what choices have to be made between supporting different types of media, and how to ensure interventions in this area are demand-led, sustainable and ultimately in the public interest; particularly the interests of the poor and marginalised. Many studies conclude there is a need for better understanding of the circumstances under which communications, and in particular the media, can be a powerful force for positive, developmental change, and why in other cases it can be a more malign force capable of blocking pro-poor reform, engendering political violence, and sustaining undemocratic political systems. \n \nThis guide highlights the major critical debates surrounding the relationship between communications, government accountability and responsiveness, and state-society relations in developing countries. It is intended primarily as a reference for policymakers, and highlights practical guidance, lessons learned and case studies on supporting the development of independent and plural media systems, increasing access to information, and using communications tools in governance reform processes across a range of contexts, including fragile and conflict-affected states.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mcloughlin, Claire","Scott, Zoe"],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929828,"sim:weight":0.473523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.429448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47362,"sim:weight":0.421244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48344,"sim:weight":0.38264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931405,"sim:weight":0.375112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47601,"sim:weight":0.348986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44822,"sim:weight":0.345895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.330507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.32341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91023,"sim:weight":0.248545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9543525,"sim:weight":0.130046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

An analysis of political settlements goes some way to answering this question by bringing into focus the contending interests that exist within any state, which constrain and facilitate institutional and developmental change. It provides a framework to analyse how the state is linked to society and what lies behind the formal representation of politics in a state. \n \nThe political settlement and the elite bargains from which it emerges are central to patterns of state fragility and resilience. The role of political organisation within the political settlement is crucial to both the stability of the settlement and the direction in which it evolves over time. The elite bargains that may lead to the establishment of what might be considered a resilient political settlement may also act as a barrier to progressive developmental change. \n \nAnalysis of political settlements suggests that state-building is far from a set of technical formulas, but is a highly political process. Creating capacity within a state to consolidate and expand taxation is fundamentally determined by the shape of the political settlement underlying the state. This is true as well for the development of service delivery or any other function of the state. This analytical framework provides a window for donors to grasp the politics of a place in order to design more effective interventions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Di John, Jonathan","Putzel, James"],"dc:date":"2009-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Acemoglu, S Johnson and J Robinson.

{"identifier":103644,"ep:Repository":119,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"State Capacity and Non-state Service Provision in Fragile and Conflict-affected States","bibo:abstract":"How can governments effectively engage with non-state providers (NSPs) of basic services where capacity is weak? This paper examines whether and how fragile and conflict affected states can co-ordinate, finance, and set and apply standards for the provision of basic services by NSPs. It explores ways of incrementally engaging the state, beginning with activities that are least likely to do harm to non-state provision. \n \nThrough the ‘indirect’ roles of setting the policy environment and engaging in policy dialogue, regulating and facilitating, contracting, and entering into mutual and informal agreements with NSPs, the state can in principle assume responsibility for the provision of basic services without necessarily being involved in direct provision. But government capacity to perform these roles is constrained by the state’s weak legitimacy, coverage and competence, lack of basic information about the non-state sector, and lack of basic organisational capacity to form and maintain relationships with NSPs. The experience of the exercise of the indirect roles in fragile settings suggests: \n \n * Governments may be more willing to engage with NSPs where there is recognition that government cannot alone deliver all services, where public and private services are not in competition, and where there is evidence that successful collaboration is possible (demonstrated through small-scale pilots). \n \n * The extent to which engagements are ‘pro-service’may be influenced by government motives for engagement and the extent to which the providers that are most important to poor people are engaged. \n \n * Formal policy dialogue between government and NSPs may be imperfect, unrepresentative and at times unhelpful in fragile settings. Informal dialogue - at the operational level - could more likely be where synergies can be found. \n \n * Regulation is more likely to be ‘pro-service’ where it offers incentives for compliance, and where it focuses on standards in terms of outputs and outcomes rather than inputs and entry controls. \n \n * Wide scale, performance-based contracting has been successful in delivering services in some cases, but the sustainability of this approach is often questioned. Some successful contractual agreements have a strong informal, relational element and grow out of earlier informal connections. \n \n * Informal and mutual agreements can avoid the capacity problems and tensions implicit in formal contracting but may present problems of non-transparency and exclusion of competition. \n \nParadoxically, the need for large-scale approaches and quick co-ordination of services in fragile and conflict-affected settings may require ‘prematurely high’ levels of state-NSP engagement, before the development of the underlying institutional structures that would support them. When considering strategies to support the capacity of government to engagement with NSPs, donors should: \n \n * Recognise non-state service provision and adopt the ‘do no harm’ principle: It would be wrong to set the ambition of \u0027managing ‘ non-state provision in its entirety, and it can be very harmful for low-capacity states to seek to regulate all NSP or to draw it into clumsy contracts. \n \n * Beware of generalisation: Non-state provision takes many forms in response to different histories and to political and economic change. The possibilities and case for state engagement have to be assessed not assumed. The particular identities of NGOs and enterprises should be considered. \n \n * Recognise that state building can occur through any of the types of engagement with NSPs: Types of engagement should therefore be selected on the basis of their likely effectiveness in improving service delivery. \n \n * Begin with less risky/small scale forms of engagement where possible: State interventions that imply a direct controlling role for the state and which impose obligations on NSPs (i.e. contracting and regulation) require greater capacity (on both sides) and present greater risk of harm if performed badly than the roles of policy dialogue and entering into mutual agreements. \n \n * Adopt mixed approaches: The choice between forms of engagement does not have to be absolute. Rather than adopting a uniform plan of engagement in a particular country, it may be better to try different approaches in different regions or sectors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Batley, Richard","Mcloughlin, Claire"],"dc:date":"2009-02","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"ADB.

{"identifier":103645,"ep:Repository":119,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Increased Religiosity Among Women in Muslim Majority Countries","bibo:abstract":"It has hitherto been assumed, at least by western development practitioners, that women\u0027s rights are best attained through secularist liberal interpretations of equality, of the sort reflected in conventions such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Yet what does increasing use of the veil and greater religious observances across the Islamic world signify in this context? Does it reflect a rejection of these standards? And if understanding this move to greater religiosity requires a different paradigm of rights then how does this \u0027Islamic\u0027 paradigm sit with the \u0027western\u0027 one? \n \nThis report argues that it is no longer possible to explain either women\u0027s various dress codes, nor their wider interest in understanding Islam, in terms of patriarchal norms and values because a large number of educated women are choosing to veil, immerse themselves in religious study and find other ways to be \u0027a true Muslim\u0027. The social, political and economic contexts within which women live in muslim majority countries (MMCs) are in a constant process of change. Their increased literacy, access to information and communication technologies, as well as to wage-earning work, and their appropriation of religious knowledge from previously closed, male-dominated circles means that Muslim women are constructing their own modernity. This symbolises a break from many traditional practices as well as from Western conceptions of progress and equality. \n \nThe issues paper argues that it is important for development policy makers and practitioners to take an interest in this upsurge in religiosity because it raises questions that are relevant to three key areas of their work: women\u0027s rights and gender equality; women as political actors (including in Islamist parties); and women\u0027s involvement in civil society (including religious movements). The annotated bibliography is written for those who want a more in-depth understanding of the issues introduced in the main paper; it nuances the debates around particular topics and includes more country examples. \n \nThe key findings of the main report and the annotated bibliography are below. \n \nOn gender equality: \n \n * The secularist approach to gender equality does exist within MMCs. However, it does not necessarily have wide appeal in MMCs; it is often seen as a foreign imposition; \n * Women throughout the Islamic world want social justice for themselves and others; the majority fervently believe that Islam can deliver this; \n * It is often difficult for women to unite as a political lobby for women\u0027s rights in MMCs; due to major divisions between a) those that believe that patriarchal and cultural interpretations of Islamic texts must be revisited and reinterpreted, and b) those that believe that these interpretations imply women are different not inferior so religious texts are not in need of reinterpretation. \n * The greatly increased propensity of women to veil today is a new phenomenon; its significance must be understood in terms of their Muslim identity but also their aspirations as modern women who want to work and travel safely, and be treated with respect not approbation. \n \nOn Islamist parties: \n \n * Islamist parties are evolving their democratic credentials and their positions on women. They have moved from a \u0027purdah\u0027 position to one that supports women as economic and political actors. But they are dragging their feet on women\u0027s personal and family rights - the power base of the religious establishment; \n * Islamist parties are out for votes; women are a critical constituency; evolving policies in line with what the majority of ordinary women feel comfortable with (Muslim identity plus social justice) makes electoral sense. Having entered the democratic process Islamist parties have an incentive to come over as politically and socially \u0027moderate\u0027, not as hard liners; \n * For donors: understanding the internal dynamics of Islamist parties is important as they may form future governments. Understanding their stand on gender issues is also critical. Donors can give non-interfering support (e.g. supporting opportunities for Islamist and non-Islamist women to build alliances; funding projects that interpret religious texts in ways that uphold women\u0027s rights; supporting women\u0027s struggles to become elected political representatives). \n \nOn religious civil society: \n \n * Millions of women in MMCs now attend religious study circles. This is a new experience for most women - in previous generations women had very little access to religious training; \n * Study circles need to be seen first and foremost as a piety movement; their adherents\u0027 main purpose is to get beyond formulaic manifestations of Islam and let religion guide their everyday actions and thoughts; but it is important to note that they do not encourage women to critique patriarchal readings of the texts; \n * There is little evidence to suggest study circles are politicised - although they may provide a link to Islamist parties in the longer term; \n * Religious instruction through study circles can be enormously empowering for women in a personal and familial sense rather than a political one. They give women an alternative means of gaining respect and authority within their households and immediate communities - an empowerment route most have not had before.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ladbury, Sarah","Khan, Seema"],"dc:date":"2008-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1381919,"sim:weight":0.65514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47205,"sim:weight":0.587754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101405,"sim:weight":0.562912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.552073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98951,"sim:weight":0.514828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47204,"sim:weight":0.501648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.486126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929831,"sim:weight":0.483727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.431592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45403,"sim:weight":0.427366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.383222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382973,"sim:weight":0.379974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930823,"sim:weight":0.37597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338285,"sim:weight":0.226409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336177,"sim:weight":0.2054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337470,"sim:weight":0.173789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788130,"sim:weight":0.101136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177145,"sim:weight":0.0851924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, this study finds that both the theoretical and empirical cases for using youth employment programmes as a tool for reducing violent conflict are extremely weak. Donor interventions have been poorly evaluated and evidence of success is usually limited to demonstrating the number of jobs created, with little effort made to assess the impact on conflict. The small number of evaluations that have examined the wider impact of job creation initiatives have found that their effects beyond direct beneficiaries are minimal. These studies also usually show limited long-term economic impacts. \r\n \r\nThe literature suggests that there are multiple motivations for youth engagement in armed violence, that these need to be understood in relation to each particular context, and that there may be considerable variation in the motivations of individual youth within any given context. In-depth case studies suggest that while youth unemployment may provide part of the explanation of why armed violence occurs, this factor is rarely a main or direct cause of violence. Even where youth employment may be a factor, its relationship to violence is complex and multi-faceted and should not simply be understood in opportunity-cost terms. Job creation initiatives alone are unlikely to generate a reduction in armed violence, even if they are successful in creating job opportunities. Evidence suggests that although frustration at lack of livelihood opportunities can play a part in motivating youth violence, social and political grievances are usually more central. \r\n \r\nThe study finds that donor approaches to reduce armed violence through job creation schemes have become more nuanced and sophisticated. There has been a growing emphasis on ‘holistic’, ‘comprehensive’ and ‘integrated’ approaches that go beyond simply addressing a lack of economic opportunities and seek to address the more complex array of factors that cause social exclusion for young people. These initiatives combine and integrate job-creation schemes with a range of other forms of intervention, such as capacity-building and training in conflict resolution. Donors have also sought to make job creation schemes more effective by conducting better contextual analysis. They have also looked to improve the effectiveness and relevance of these schemes by working more closely with the private sector and tackling the demand-side of youth unemployment. Despite this progress, there is a still a significant gap between donor rhetoric and practice in this area.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walton, Oliver"],"dc:date":"2010-10-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(1981). 5 According to the definition used by the United Nations, the term “youth” defines those persons age between 15 and 24 years old; this definition was endorsed by the General Assembly (see A/36/215 and resolution 36/28,","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"5 According to the definition used by the United Nations, the term “youth” defines those persons age between 15 and 24 years old; this definition was endorsed by the General Assembly (see A/36/215 and resolution 36/28,","dc:date":"1981"}],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48367,"sim:weight":0.309311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18142,"sim:weight":0.281409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46592,"sim:weight":0.279676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.252925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.251933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91023,"sim:weight":0.229388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A statistical analysis on a provincial panel data from 1978 to 2007 confirms the increasing regional inequality in China can be understood as different patterns of regional economic growth, which are affected by factors such as capital and labour inputs, education and institutional variables. We base our study on a growth accounting model with a Cobb-Douglas production function. We find that there are significantly positive associations between education and GDP per worker, total factor productivity and wage. In particular, senior secondary schooling is most important for China’s productivity and wage, especially for economic growth. University and above only improves the economic growth, suggesting that government should pay more for the university and above than individuals. The effect of education on economic growth appears to be much stronger after 1994 and mainly occurs in the coastal region. Moreover, institutional variables, such as FDI and openness affect positively, while inflation rate and birth rate have negative effect. The impact of semi-private and private units, fiscal expenditure on education and industrialization on the three productivity proxies are mixed. We conclude that investing in human capital with further market reform will be an effective policy to promote economic growth as well as a remedy to increasing regional inequality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kang, Lili"],"dc:date":"2009-07-23","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Agarwala.

Based on the standard Mincerian human capital earning function, we adopt the OLS and IV models to see the difference of controlling endogeneity of schooling or not. Education is measured in two ways: years of schooling (input) and highest educational qualification (output, 5 categories of educational levels). We find that OLS estimate of the returns to schooling in the 2000s is higher than the 1990s. The returns to “college and above” and “professional school” increase across time, while the returns to “upper and lower middle school” decrease from 1990s to 2000s. In addition, if we do not control for endogeneity bias of schooling, the OLS estimates of the returns to schooling will be underestimated, especially in the 2000s.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kang, Lili","Peng, Fei"],"dc:date":"2010-07-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Appleton, L Song and Q Xia.

Based on the standard Mincerian human capital earning function, we adopt the OLS and IV models to see the difference of controlling endogeneity of schooling or not. Education is measured in two ways: years of schooling (input) and highest educational qualification (output, 5 categories of educational levels). We find that OLS estimate of the returns to schooling and education levels in the 2000s is higher than before, and higher education, higher return. In addition, if we do not control for endogeneity bias of schooling, the OLS estimates of the returns to schooling will be underestimated, especially before 2000.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kang, Lili"],"dc:date":"2010-09-28","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J D Angrist and A B Krueger.

It first examines data from EUKLEMS using regressions standard in the literature and suggests ICT may have adversely affected older workers, in particular high skilled males aged 50 and over. The paper then uses data from the UK Labour Force Survey, linked to EUKLEMS, to examine whether the observed differences by worker type could be due to variations in on the job training. It shows that training linked to ICT use can explain some of the wage variation and that reluctance by older men to undertake training has a role as well as lower offers of training by firms.","bibo:AuthorList":["O’Mahony, Mary","Peng, Fei"],"dc:date":"2008-06-19","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Autor, L Katz and A Krueger.

We distinguish between job stayers (remaining in the same job), and within- and between-company job movers. Stayers are the large majority in both countries. Using changes in the unemployment rate as the cyclical measure, we find real wages of stayers in the private sector in West Germany – but not East Germany – to be procyclical, and quite sensitive to unemployment, comparable to the US and the UK. We find cyclicality in the public sector in neither country. Thus real wage flexibility is similar in the two countries, apart from East Germany, despite apparent differences in wage-setting institutions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Peng, Fei","Siebert, Stan"],"dc:date":"2007-03","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"x Devereu.

This paper analyzes the link between institutions and the skill premium in the UK controlling for other explanatory variables such as market conditions, international trade and skill-biased technology. \n \nFor the private sector, institutions are more important for the unskilled baseline group than the skilled groups. The trade union decline after 1979 brings different effect on wages of skilled and unskilled workers and pushes the skill premium up. We find that the trade union decline in unskilled workers can explain about one third degree premium increase over the period 1979-1998. The overall effect of trade union in all workers can explain about 13.34 percent of degree premium increase during the same period. Our results are insensitive to skill group categorization. \n \nMoreover, we find that minimum wages can only decrease skill premiums of high skilled workers rather than low skilled workers. The increase of unemployment benefit over the period 1979-1998 reduces the increasing the skill premium by about 13.6 percent. But, the mark-up effect of taxation increase skill premium by about 8.26 percent. We find no significant associations between above institutions and skill premiums in the public sector.","bibo:AuthorList":["Peng, Fei"],"dc:date":"2008-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Acemoglu.

The extant literatures mention little about the determinants of firm’s acquisition size at micro economic level. With recent available data of acquisitions in Chinese stock market (Shanghai and Shenzhen) during 2003-2008, we estimate the effect of institutional ownership on firms’ acquisition size controlling financial and governance characteristics. In an industry fixed effect model, firms’ acquisition size is significantly and positively associated with firm size, Tobin’s Q, leverage ratio, cash holing level and internal capital expenditure. Acquisition size is positively related to some governance characteristics of firms such as board size, independency of board and activity of board, but negatively related to the duality of chairman and CEO. However, annual dividend, management holding, intangible asset, ownership concentration and the identity of ownership seems unrelated to acquisition size. The monitoring effect of different institutional ownership including qualified foreign institutional investors (QFII), social security fund (SSF), security firms (SF) and security investment funds (SIF) on the acquisition of listed firms are investigated. We find that QFII and SIF increase acquisition size of those over-acquisition firms while only SSF have significant monitoring effects on those under-acquisition firms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Peng, Fei","Kang, Lili","Jiang, Jun"],"dc:date":"2010-07-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"O Andersen.

TVAAS is not a ‘test’ of anything, and other analysts have attributed the same student progress residuals as used in TVAAS to school, classroom, district, leadership, social and economic factors. \n \nThe analysis appears to be circular – effective teachers are defined by progress of students so students making progress have necessarily effective teachers. The analysis anyway cannot be sustained with the kinds of data available. \n \nThe estimated level of missing data, and of measurement and representational error in the data that is present, suggest that the estimated residuals for each student are composed largely of error terms.

Overall the lesson from care trusts appears to be that structure can provide additional benefits but only if there is a history of joint working and trust, a clear vision and the active engagement of prospective users, local community and staff. Furthermore their experiences underline that the historic differences and tensions between health and social care remain, and that integrating with one service can lead to a greater distance from another. These are important lessons for Health \u0026 Well-being Boards to build on as the English system moves to the new world of GP led commissioning, a national public health organisation and community services being delivered by a range of organisational forms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miller, Robin","Dickinson, Helen","Glasby, Jon"],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2002).

Evidence from an inner city community","bibo:abstract":"This paper examines the potential impact of social enterprise on exclusion. The case study research involved participant observation over a two year period. Selection of cases was based on a preliminary typology for social enterprise. Exclusion was conceptualised as multi-dimensional and relative to the standards of the society in which a person lives. The research literature suggests that the aggregate impact of social enterprise on economic dimensions of exclusion is marginal. This is a consequence of a mismatch between policy expectations and what is happening in the field. This study found that different forms of social enterprise impacted on exclusion in different ways. People could become included within a group, but remain excluded by the standards of the society they lived in. This paper outlines these different impacts in order to open up a more balanced perspective on the potential and limitation of social enterprise in combating area based exclusion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Teasdale, Simon"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Aiken.

The figure of 62,000 social enterprises has been regularly based on a minimum three year rolling average of the Annual Small Business Survey between 2005 and 2007. In this paper we show that different surveys have been based upon samples drawn from widely disparate populations. The Annual Small Business Survey is shown to be dominated by private enterprises (Companies Limited by Share, Partnerships and Sole Proprietors) while other surveys such as the National Survey of Third Sector Organisations, have only looked at particular elements of civil society. By understanding the origins of each source of data, a better evidence base can be developed that draws on the different data sources. While there is still on-going debate about the definitions of social enterprise, careful presentation of data sources can allow those using the data to be clearer about what they are including or excluding. We show how different definitions of social enterprise result in widely differing estimations of the population. Estimations of social enterprise activity may be more reliable as the definitions are more consistently applied. This working paper aims to present data and seeks feedback from the social enterprise community and researchers as part of improving the evidence base.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lyon, Fergus","Teasdale, Simon","Baldock, Rob"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Bridge, B Murtagh and K O‟Neill.

Case study findings summary to inform consultation at St George’s House, Windsor Castle, December 2010","bibo:abstract":"Self-help housing ‘involves groups of local people bringing back into use empty properties that are in limbo, awaiting decisions about their future use, or their redevelopment. It differs from self-build housing which involves constructing permanent homes from scratch’. It responds to the bigger picture of entrenched problems in society today including homelessness and unmet housing needs, empty homes, unemployment and low levels of construction skills, planning blight, neighbourhood dereliction and fear of crime, and low levels of local economic activity and enterprise. Yet despite these potential benefits self-help housing remains a small scale and largely unrecognised part of the housing third sector. TSRC research has been exploring the reasons for this limited and the ways in which its potential could be harnessed by local groups and key partners and the types of policies that might enable this. \nThis case study report is one of a series of outputs from TSRC research on self-help housing. It was produced to present evidence drawn from eight case studies of a variety of models of self-help housing in different local contexts to inform a consultation with policy makers, funders, umbrella groups and self-help housing projects held at St George’s House, Windsor in December 2010. The report describes the case study projects and potential benefits of self-help housing in meeting a variety of public policy outcomes, and presents evidence on the barriers and enablers and critical success factors found in the case studies. It raises a number of questions that were explored further in the Consultation event leading to policy recommendations. It is published here to provide wider access to the TSRC research data on which the Consultation report to be published by BSHF draws. The TSRC working paper that preceded this work (Mullins, 2010) and a separate briefing paper on implications for tackling homelessness (Teasdale et al, 2011) can be downloaded from the TSRC website.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mullins, David","Jones, Patricia A","Teasdale, Simon"],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Archer.

Whilst the term itself is recent, and accompanied by the ‘new language’ of social action, there are continuities between the current Coalition policy objectives and those of the previous New Labour administration: the devolution of powers to the local level, the reconfiguration of services and promotion of community engagement, empowerment and active citizenship. \nThis working paper explores the debates about, ‘below the radar’ (BTR) community groups and their assumed role in delivering ‘big society’. It argues that the motivators for community action are, and have been, ill understood in policy circles. Further, there is and has been little systematic analysis of the power relationship between the state (both locally and nationally) communities and neighbourhoods which can inform meaningful debate on devolution and localism. The paper examines the implications of the ‘new’ policy environment for small community groups and asks can such activity, which has often been independent of, and operated outside the state, be co-opted to deliver particular government policy objectives?","bibo:AuthorList":["McCabe, Angus"],"dc:date":"2010-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Alcock.

One of these, social return on investment (SROI) has received particular attention and is being promoted by third sector organisations, as well as public and private bodies. This paper examines this approach in detail and identifies a series of issues that require further investigation. These include technical and methodological issues related to this adjusted cost-benefit analysis such as quantifying the value of social benefits, and attribution; the judgement involved in setting indicators; whether projects deemed successful based on an SROI analysis can provide the basis for replicability and scaling up; and the ways in which SROI is being used by stakeholders. Through examining these challenges in detail, the approaches to measuring social impact can be strengthened, standardised and made more rigorous. While the issues raised here are essential to developing SROI further, they are also valid for more general discussions regarding the proving and improving of the value added by the UK third sector.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arvidon, Malin","Lyon, Fergus","McKay, Stephen","Moro, Domenico"],"dc:date":"2010-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"W Beckerman and J Pasek.

Building on the experiences of the Social Enterprise Pathfinder Programme it addressed key barriers that had been identified such as NHS staff transferring their current pension entitlements and security over the initial contract lengths. It also provided access to the Social Enterprise Investment Fund which could be used to support staff groups in completing their business cases and bringing in external consultancy and support. The Coalition Government continued the scheme, and it is estimated that approximately 10% of the community health services currently provided by Primary Care Trusts are in the process of completing their business cases or have already launched as social enterprises. The University of Birmingham have been supporting managers and clinicians within the West Midlands who are seeking to develop a social enterprise. In this paper we reflect on their experiences and the response of the local health systems in which they work. We identify that there have been a number of barriers to staff who were keen to pursue this option, and make recommendations for what could be done to encourage and support NHS staff to set up social enterprises in the future. The findings and recommendations are also of relevance for other parts of the public sector in which a ‘right of challenge’ is being introduced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miller, Robin","Millar, Ross"],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Austin, H Stevenson and J Wei-Skillern.

Using research methods which combined documentary analysis with qualitative interviews with key policy actors in the third sector, we examine the relative success of different campaigning methods in an election that was unique both in its uncertain electoral outcome and in terms of the relative consensus that political parties expressed at the outset towards the third sector. A range of third sector and political manifestos are considered, highlighting the ideological significance of the language employed and assessing the impact of one against the other. Attention is drawn to the raised profile achieved by the third sector early in the election campaign and reflected in its coverage in the three main political parties’ manifestos. This was followed by a relative lack of substantive sectoral discussion during the unusual period of the election and purdah, when the sector concentrated upon a consolidation and commentary role. The Conservative’s Big Society agenda lost momentum during the election, and the Citizens UK ‘fourth debate’ prompted an unexpected late surge of media interest in the sector. The new political realities of the post-election period have seen refocus on policy development and rebranding, return to third sector campaigning and realignment in sectoral–state relations in the context of a (revived) Big Society politics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Parry, Jane","Alcock, Peter","Kendall, Jeremy"],"dc:date":"2010-11","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Charity Commission.

This paper can be located in a new phase of conceptual research, which seeks to attend to the historical, cultural and politically contingent nature of this domain’s boundaries. The process of constructing, adapting and shifting the positioning of boundaries, and movement across those evolving boundaries comes especially into focus. It takes England as a case study, drawing on evidence and argument assembled by the authors in recent and ongoing research efforts, variously conducted with the support of the Third Sector Research Centre (TSRC) and the European Commission. The paper proceeds by discussing relevant literature; describing recent patterns of policy institutionalisation; and then tries to draw out more analytically how this process has indeed not been associated with a stable and consistent set of definitions and constructs, but rather with unstable and changing formulations, which reflect the playing out of a dual process of decontestation and contention.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alcock, Peter","Kendall, Jeremy"],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P and D Leat.

Much of the existing research into the Third Sector has focused on formal, larger, organisations leaving gaps in the knowledge base around the nature and function of small groups and more informal activities which happen at a community level. \n \nThe following working paper is based on interviews with representatives from national community sector organisations, development agencies, members of policy fora and academics with a background in community based research. It explores the scale, scope and functions of ‘below the radar’ activity in the Third Sector, why people become active within their community and the factors which both help and hinder community based action. Finally the paper explores the strengths and weaknesses of ‘below the radar’ action, issues of accountability and asks the question – are their features that make more informal community organisation and activity distinctive.","bibo:AuthorList":["Phillimore, Jenny","McCabe, Angus","Soteri-Proctor, Andri","Taylor, Rebecca"],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Murdoch Abram, J Marsden and T.

This was a period of rapid policy change with a rise in the profile of voluntary action to rival, if not outstrip, that at any point in the previous century. This rising profile was also accompanied by terminological change, and debate, in effect the creation of a new entity – the third sector. The paper reviews the institutional and policy changes introduced by the Labour governments between 1997 and 2010, setting these in the context of previous political and policy development of the sector. It concludes by assessing the extent to which this constituted a new and distinctive policy regime, characterised by the notions of partnership and mainstreaming, and speculates on the future prospects for this in changing economic and political circumstances.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alcock, Peter"],"dc:date":"2010-03","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P and D Leat.

Making sense of failure in a third sector social enterprise","bibo:abstract":"This paper examines the experiences of a single social enterprise that grew rapidly but ended in failure. Over more than 8 years, the author conducted intensive field research during the social enterprise’s life and held detailed post-mortems with key players after its death. This material is part of longitudinal research on social enterprise activity in the voluntary and community sectors, (Pharoah, Scott and Fisher, 2004; Russell and Scott, 2007). It is complemented by a review of five studies of social enterprise failure, together with some wider reflections about reporting on various ‘troubles’ (e.g. error, failure and scandal). The primary emphasis is upon problems involved in ‘making sense’, but is illustrated with reference to the experiences of this case study and the limited literature relating to social enterprise failure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Scott, Duncan W"],"dc:date":"2010-02","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Ahmed.

However, there is a high degree of confusion over what personalisation is and the types of changes that will be associated with this agenda. There are many ways in which the concept of personalisation might be interpreted, all of which have different implications for service users and service providers, particularly in terms of the mechanisms which have been introduced to try and facilitate these changes. Personalisation has a considerable history and has the potential to offer very different services to those that have been delivered in the past. Moreover, the underpinning philosophy of the personalisation movement is aligned with the types of values which a number of third sector organisations have been advocating for some time. Personalisation is more than a passing political fad and third sector organisations need to think carefully about how they will respond and shape the many changes which have already started to happen and that will increase in momentum over the coming months. This paper sets out the major features of the personalisation agenda and drawing on existing evidence sets out the key research, policy and practice implications of this for the third sector. Personalisation offers the potential for much improvement in terms of the way in which individuals with care needs are supported, but might also potentially mean significant changes for providers involved in the delivery of welfare services. It is important that third sector bodies understand these implications and are able to respond to these appropriately or else risk losing out in this change process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dickinson, Helen","Glasby, Jon"],"dc:date":"2010-02","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"V Alakeson.

Forty-eight separate pieces of research published between 2004 and 2010 on the themes of public service delivery, commissioning and procurement are reviewed. This body of literature represents the research response to the new third sector public sector delivery landscape which has developed out of the UK Labour government’s interest in promoting the sector’s role in service delivery. The review examines four themes developed from the literature: emerging commissioning and procurement practices; the experiences of third sector organisations in the new service delivery landscape; the support needs of third sector organisations, and the impact of the new service delivery landscape on third sector organisations. \n \nBy examining what we think we know and suggesting priorities for ongoing research, the paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion of the sector’s role in service delivery. The third sector’s experience of the new service delivery landscape has been somewhat mixed and varied. But new questions will be asked about the sector’s experience in an era marked by public finance retrenchment and under different political and ideological priorities. As a ‘stock-take’ and a baseline for a new economic and political context, the review indicates where research attention has been focused, and where it hasn’t. Overall greater attention appears to have been given to the voices and concerns of staff involved in TSOs, rather than other stakeholders such as trustees, volunteers and particularly TSO members and service users. By contrast, far less research attention has been given to the nature of the services commissioned, whether new commissioning processes are leading to service improvement, and fundamentally what difference services make.","bibo:AuthorList":["Macmillan, Rob"],"dc:date":"2010-07","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"ACEVO.

It argues that there is no one kind of economic analysis but that a certain form of such thinking, and associated techniques, has become dominant in thinking and practice. That mainstream approach is appropriate for certain functions and understandings but can also act to funnel or prioritise certain dimensions of third sector activity, ignoring others. It is important therefore in any economic analytic work on the third sector to engage with different forms of economic theory and practice (such as ecological, or institutional economics) as well as cross-disciplinary approaches (such as geographical or socio-economics). \nEconomic analysis may often just apply to the relative impact of the third sector on accepted statistical dimensions of the economy, such as employment or GDP. This paper argues that this approach misses the many and complex ways in which different parts of the third sector may impact on economic activity in the UK. Ultimately, the aim of this paper is to range over issues of both practical and conceptual importance, in order to enable a more informed and contextualised sense of options, priorities, and possibilities for further in-depth work in the economic analysis of the third sector.","bibo:AuthorList":["Westall, Andrea"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Alcock.

Their experience of 40 years of capacity building, struggles around combining public service delivery while preserving some independence and shifting from charity to social entrepreneurial models has considerable relevance for other third sector organisations. Their hybrid financial model places housing associations squarely between the state and the market. While the core activities of associations in constructing and managing affordable housing is a crucial contribution to society, greater attention is often given to their social investment and neighbourhood activities when considering their added value. While larger associations are sometimes seen as having grown away from third sector roots, the importance of generating a social as well as a financial return and the impact of successful neighbourhoods on their business results is generally recognised. Recent policy and regulation issues have included a legal challenge to the non-public status of housing associations, a major review of regulation and adjustments responding to the credit crisis and recession and most recently responding to the Coalition Government, including public expenditure reductions and the Big Society agenda. While the housing association field was, for 40 years, tightly structured around a single dedicated funding and regulatory body, the Housing Corporation, since 2008 it has had separate regulatory and funding bodies each of which relate to other social landlords as well. This looser field structure may have important implications for the future evolution and identity of housing associations. Further research on the sector could address the adaptation of the housing association sector to the new government, localism, neighbourhood focus and social investment impacts, mergers and alliances and responding to efficiency and accountability agendas.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mullins, David"],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Arvidson.

This is usually based on a time-limited licence or lease, but sometimes on a permanent basis, and there are possibilities for asset transfer. Models of self-help housing range from informal community housing projects, to social enterprises that also involve construction skills and other training for homeless people, young people, refugees and other disadvantaged groups as part of a more holistic approach to providing housing and employment. \n \nSelf-help housing constitutes a small part of the housing-related Third Sector. However it epitomises a form of bottom-up organisation that once played a more important role, particularly in the late 1970s when municipal housing schemes were delayed by public spending cuts, leaving empty properties which had already been acquired, and were then brought into use by ‘short-life groups’. Now there would appear to be a similar opportunity in the context of reductions in public expenditure and policy support for self-help. Self-help housing seems to tick all the right boxes in offering a low-cost approach to meeting community housing needs (particularly for single people and couples who are not usually given priority for social housing), and maintaining some momentum in regeneration programmes while offering work training and experience to those participating. \n \nHowever, while there are a number of successful self-help projects, these are generally small scale and ‘below the radar’. To be successful, self-help housing organisations need to secure a supply of properties, funding, volunteers and residents. Further research is required to identify how these success conditions can be met, drawing on the experience of self-help housing projects from the different organisational models identified above in different local contexts. It will be important to relate these experiences to contemporary policy and financial drivers and to use the research to engage with policy makers, property owners and funders and with self-help models in other service areas.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mullins, David"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Archer.

It seeks to define what we mean by ‘below the radar’ activity and identify different radars that might form the focus of research. \n \nIt is clear from discussion around BTR activity, that it is necessary to move beyond simplistic definitions that focus on registration to a more sophisticated approach encompassing a range of different radars. Similarly, there is a need to move away from a deficit model, which makes negative assumptions about what it means to be ‘below the radar’. \n \nWe have tried to develop a sampling frame to differentiate BTR activity from more mainstream activities being researched by other work streams. We want to ensure that small community based actions are also included in the economic/impact, service delivery and social enterprise elements of TSRC research. \n \nOur exploration of the characteristics of below the radar activity culminates in a series of issues to be researched further, rather than reaching definitive conclusions. Our understanding, and classification, of such activity will evolve, as we use theoretical and empirical knowledge to inform our thinking. Thus, while we have outlined our initial thoughts around defining BTR activity, we expect this thinking to be influenced by the findings from our fieldwork. \n \nThe next step for the BTR work stream is to develop a methodology to explore the full range of BTR activity sketched out in this paper.","bibo:AuthorList":["McCabe, Angus","Phillimore, Jenny"],"dc:date":"2009-07","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Burns and M Taylor.

At the time, the government was keen to demonstrate the radical and innovative nature of its proposals, but as opposition has increased the language seems to have changed, with policy makers stressing the way in which proposals build on previous policy. \n \nAs the Health and Social Care Bill goes to the House of Lords in forthcoming months, a policy paper from the Health Services Management Centre analyses this new reform programme. Overall, the paper suggests the reform proposals represent a large degree of continuity or evolution from previous reform agendas. However, they also raise the point that the combined impact of the reforms when implemented may have the potential to bring about radical change as the scale and speed of the proposed changes take effect. They reflect on the contextual factors likely to affect the implementation of the policy proposals and raise some practical implications for researchers and practitioners to consider in relation to this new reform agenda.","bibo:AuthorList":["Millar, Ross","Snelling, Iain","Brown, Hilary"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2006).

Third Sector policy across the UK since 2000","bibo:abstract":"Since the end of the last century the United Kingdom has been a less united country than it was. In 1999 a separate Scottish Executive (from 2007 the Scottish Government) and Welsh Assembly Government were established, followed later by a new Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, based on a power sharing agreement known from its date in 1998 as the ‘Good Friday Agreement’. A number of key policy making powers were devolved from Westminster to these new administrations; these include policy on and support for third sector activity in the different countries. Since 2000 therefore there have in effect been four separate policy regimes within the UK focused on the activity and organisation of third sector organisations, although, compared to the greater levels of regional devolution existing in many other developed industrial nations, the UK remains a largely centralised state in both political and policy terms. This paper explores some of the key implications of this recent devolution and examines the extent to which it has led to a divergence in policy development and delivery – asking the question, to what extent has devolution led to a divergence in third sector policy regimes across the UK?","bibo:AuthorList":["Alcock, Peter"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"N Acheson.

Rather than studying how existing information is used or not used in decision making, this report is looking at how decision makers go about searching, analysing, summarising, processing and interpreting information when they need to make a decision. \n \nThe report consists of three main chapters. \n- A summary of key government policy initiatives in the UK to stimulate the use of information in decision making \n- A review of the relevant research literature.

Furthermore, human genetic structure is masked by many regulatory genes. Hence environment is likely to specify any obesigenic pattern of metabolism, movement or ingestion. The least fattening patterns of behaviour therefore need to be identified in a culture’s own categories. The times at which an individual carries out such an eating or exercise custom detect a sustained change in its frequency, after which any change in weight is tracked to asymptote. The closest published approximation to this psychosocial approach to weight control was around Birmingham (England) in the late 1980s, cf. Appetite 43, 277-283 (2004). While the obesity research community continues to refuse support, a pilot study of the simplest effective design has been run in French Canada. In that culture, individual differences in eating vegetables and in avoiding calories, low-calorie meals or fruit and salad fairly consistently correlate at present with decline in weight over 2-4 weeks. Cross-lagged correlation shows when change in frequency of a custom one week causes subsequent change in weight, rather than weight change precipitating behaviour change. Effects of eating customs on weight emerge from 1970s calculations of energy exchange regulation (since replicated and extended by four other groups) but may be undetectable as sensory, digestive or social influences on states of appetite and its sating.","bibo:AuthorList":["Booth, David A.","Thibault, Louise","Chesneau, Caroline","Baek, Seolhyang"],"dc:date":"2006-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In 1888-9, E.H. Weber discovered one of the first basic principles of Experimental Psychology: equal ratios of the quantity of stimulation to the senses were rated as equally different in intensity, when the levels of input were moderate. This semilog linear range of an input/output function for physical or chemical stimuli is plain linear when the stimuli are symbolic such as quantitative descriptions. This discriminative sensitivity of an output can therefore be used as a scaling unit for quantities of any input. Furthermore, inputs that are treated as the same by an output will summate in discrimination units from the level to which the person or animal has learnt: that is, an information-transmitting channel through an adapted intelligent system constitutes a mental dimension. If two transforms operate over different channels, then their interaction is orthogonal. Hence the simplest account of a mind is as a Euclidean hyperspace of distinct causal processes. When two outputs are observed from one input, two distinct ways of processing the input may be distinguished. With sufficiently independent multiple inputs tested on specific outputs as well as on an overall output of interest, the set of possible processes and their interactions can be tested against each other on the individual’s multiple discrimination performance in acting on variants of a specific situation (Booth \u0026 Freeman, 1993; data-analytic program in Java: ‘Co-Pro’, 2006). Several examples of such cognitive diagnosis will be given: empathy, sympathy and compassion; emoticons; craving fior chocolate; appetite for foods in pictures. An argument offered for discussion -- made in a response to EC FP5 Models of Consciousness 2003 in an MS now on epapers.bham.ac.uk -- is that the development of intelligent robots needs to include a science of artificial performance, analogous to this psychological science of natural performance – i.e., ‘POEMS’, Psychology Of Emerging Machine Souls / Sentients / Symbolisers / Subjectivities!","bibo:AuthorList":["Booth, David A."],"dc:date":"2008-11-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Booth has research doctorates in biochemistry and in psychology. \n \nA main area of his research since 1964 has been the neural, digestive, metabolic, sensory and social influences on, and effects of, choices and intakes of foods and drinks, and how all these causal processes interact in the individual’s life. \n \nOne major effort in this area has been to characterise and to measure the least fattening customs of eating within local environments. This talk highlights a pilot study conducted in the School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition in McGill University that is now being extended by a nutrition graduate and obesity dietitian from Mexico who is studying for a research degree in Psychology with David Booth and colleagues at the University of Birmingham.","bibo:AuthorList":["Booth, David A."],"dc:date":"2008-11-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Psychological knowledge is not based on subjective contents of a private world, neural causation or brain activity, societal causation or cultural functions, bodily movements or physical dynamics and cannot be reduced to environmental or/and genetic origins. As I understand it, God is the sustainer of all things, the biosphere, human society, and the cultural, physiological and mental life of each of us. \nGod upholds the mechanisms of physics, politics and mind. God does not put the atoms in their places; rather, God keeps creating the same causal powers - ‘laws’ of nature, including red in tooth and claw, and‘laws’ of society, including powers of this dark world. To deal with all of this, human beings have been given the biosocial capacity to take complementing roles in a shared task - that is, to be loving.","bibo:AuthorList":["Booth, David A."],"dc:date":"2006-11-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The study researched a selection of 21st-century reading events which employ mass media (TV and radio) and city-wide reading projects which employ the ‘One Book, One Community’ model. \r\n \r\nThe primary aims of the transnational study were to investigate how mass reading events configure contemporary practices of reading and the cultural meanings of reading at local, national and international levels; to explain the uses and complexities of reading communities in different locations; to identify and analyse trans-national trends and differences in contemporary reading cultures and reading practices; and, to critique the popular function of literary fiction. \r\n \r\nThe file contains the merged data collected from a series of 9 online surveys of readers in Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool, Chicago, Huntsville (Ala), Seattle, Vancouver, and across Canada and the UK. Convenience sampling was employed. The surveys were advertised through adverts in newspapers, on-line advertisements; flyers and bookmarks distributed through public library systems and cultural centres; via email through the research team’s formal and informal social and professional networks. The data includes reading choice, habits and practices; participation in broadcast and community book programming; and, basic demographic information (anonymised). The statistical data is deposited in .sav .csv and .por formats. \r\n \r\nNB. The data from a pilot study conducted in Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge (Canada) in September-October 2004 (funded by the British Academy) does not form part of the deposited dataset but this material does inform the published results of the ‘Beyond the Book’ project. \r\n \r\nCollateral material includes: Codebook \r\n \r\nContent was created between ca. 2005-10-01 and 2008-08-25.

This work explores the effect of schooling on playing level and performance post compulsory physical education. After ethical approval an online questionnaire collected retrospective recall data on the sport practice patterns of people raised and schooled in the UK. 1,006 individuals provided information about their schooling along with their sport participation between 16 and 18 years old. \n \nThere was a significant association between type of schooling and the highest playing level achieved aged 16 to 18, 2(8) \u003d 29.1, p\u003c0.001. Individuals who received state schooling were less likely to play at national level than those who received grammar (0.94 times) and private (0.34 times) schooling. This pattern continued at the representative level (grammar, 0.73 times; private, 0.34 times) and school level (grammar, 0.43 times; private, 0.19 times). Compared to not playing at all individuals at private schools were more likely to play at national level (2.78 times), representative level (2.13 times), club level (1.67 times) and school level (2.25 times) than individuals at grammar school. In terms of overall sports participation individuals aged 16-18 at private schools were 2.7 times more likely to play sport than those at state schools a similar pattern was seen between grammar and private schools (2.5 times more likely to play sport). \n \nThe data suggest that there is a clear need to explore and address the imbalances in playing performance and participation created within the current UK schooling system. Such imbalances surely serve to undermine an individual’s opportunity for both sporting achievement and participation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bridge, Matthew W","Toms, Martin R"],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":1632927,"ep:Repository":119,"dc:type":["Image","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The Nestorian Stele","bibo:abstract":"The Orchard Learning Resources Centre in the University of Birmingham possesses a rubbing of this famous monument of Chinese Christian history which was made directly from the stele in the 1920s. This is a composite photograph of this rubbing made in 2008. \r\n \r\nThis limestone stele (about ten feet high) was discovered in the sixteenth century after it had been buried and lost for about 800 years. Today the monument is housed in the \"Forest of Tablets\" in Shaanxi Provincial Museum (formerly a Confucian Temple) in Xi\u0027an. \r\n \r\nThe monument was erected in 781 C.E. to commemorate the first coming of Christianity to China in the year 635 C.E. Arriving through the 5,000-mile Silk Road that linked ancient Antioch and metropolitan Changan (today Xi’an), the first Christians were essentially traders from Persia belonging to the Church of the East. They became known as “Nestorians”, a pejorative name given to them by other Christians who regarded themselves as being more orthodox. \r\n \r\nThe monument tells about the penetrating “illuminous religion” which began in Daqin (the Great Mediterranean), as opposed to Zoroastrianism, which had also come to Changan. It describes basic Christian doctrines: the “three mystery body” (trinity), the creation, the fall, the virgin birth, the holy books (of the bible), and practices such as the “holy mystery” (eucharist) and names of religious leaders, especially “Alopen” who was its Persian “missionary”. Names of priests and monks are listed in Syriac. The text ends with a hymn of praise. \r\n \r\nThe inscription also tells about the favourable treatment that the Nestorians received from Tai Zong (627-649 C.E.), the Tang emperor who himself constituted a Board of Rites (analogous to the Bureau of Religious Affairs today), approving this foreign religion. Emperor Tai Zong even granted land to the Nestorians and helped them build a monastery to which twenty-one newly ordained priests were attached. \r\n \r\nIn essence, what the stele conveys is that the followers of this foreign religion are good people who will not harm or threaten the Chinese way of life. They should be allowed to exist. Largely dependent on imperial patronage, Nestorian Christianity did not survive the several dynastic changes ofter the Tang (618-906 C.E.). \r\n \r\nCredits \r\nThe project to digitise the rubbing was led by Dr Roderic L. Mullen and Edmond Tang. The images were prepared by Dr Mullen and Dr Hugh Houghton. We are very grateful to Dorothy Vuong of the Orchard Learning Centre. The text of this abstract has been adapted from a description by Franklin J.

A longitudinal research gaze offers the promise of seeing things differently, and of understanding the dynamic processes involved in social change, of what happens next and why. This paper explores the potential of qualitative longitudinal research for developing understanding of the dynamics of the third sector. The Third Sector Research Centre has embarked upon a qualitative longitudinal study of third sector activities called ‘Real Times’. The paper sets out the thinking behind the study. As well as providing a basic description of the rationale, design and structure of ‘Real Times’, the paper discusses the methodological interest in qualitative longitudinal research in the third sector, the substantive contextual issues the third sector is experiencing as the study takes place, and some of the theoretical thinking involved in the study. In particular it discusses three theoretical ‘imaginings’ which inform the research: the different temporalities involved in the third sector; a ‘relational’ account of the third sector as a contested field; and lastly the idea of strategic action in context.","bibo:AuthorList":["Macmillan, Rob"],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"B Adam.

This study seeks to reflect on the commonly accepted portrayal of Bright’s popularity and question the extent to which it represents the reality. It will consider Bright as a parliamentary candidate for Birmingham, as an MP for the town, and as the guest of honour at the celebration of his silver jubilee. In each case, it will reflect on the currently accepted interpretation of him as an immensely popular figure and, through the examination of a wide range of evidence, reassess this accordingly.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bounous, Pete"],"dc:date":"2011-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382064,"sim:weight":0.397472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382037,"sim:weight":0.350915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99294,"sim:weight":0.333149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108340,"sim:weight":0.320504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108800,"sim:weight":0.319303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767710,"sim:weight":0.315646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4415,"sim:weight":0.315332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890342,"sim:weight":0.315283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.313574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43413,"sim:weight":0.312672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.311612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112506,"sim:weight":0.311145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929875,"sim:weight":0.309686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382035,"sim:weight":0.309433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43673,"sim:weight":0.306641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108592,"sim:weight":0.303087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46839,"sim:weight":0.293838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631941,"sim:weight":0.29044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43392,"sim:weight":0.285433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352209,"sim:weight":0.283089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Working paper on ideas for future research","bibo:abstract":"This paper provides a broad sweep across the ideas and practices around ‘value’, and how these relate to third sector organisations and activities. It argues that the current focus on outcome-based ‘social value’ by academics and policy-makers is limited and only part of how third sector organisations operate, why they exist, or how they contribute to society. It also shows how the new measurement approaches, predicated on ideas of blended value, open up opportunities for resources and impact but may downplay the inevitable conflicts in outcomes, stakeholder concerns, and ignore moral values or processes. These new measurement approaches also attempt to add together outcomes which cannot always be easily combined. The paper suggests ideas for a research agenda that begins to fill gaps in current understanding, and reweights policy and practice to better ‘value’ and support diverse third sector activity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Westall, Andrea"],"dc:date":"2009-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Auerswald.

In the Italian context, problematically heteronormative forms of sexuality are ever-present in the media, while sexual minorities face a hostile climate in which their rights are not yet fully recognised. I argue that this climate has been mitigated by activist initiatives, and forms of inhabiting and occupaying space, from everyday socialising, to participation in specific cultural activities, to large-scale demonstrations, which all contribute to ‘queerings’ of space. The article further suggests that the queering of space enables community building, increases the visibility and status of minority populations, and is a vital means to achieving greater livability. However, this queering is often temporary, amounting only to a ‘tactic’ rather than a ‘strategy’, to use de Certeau’s terminology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ross, Charlotte"],"dc:date":"2006-03","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Robert Aldrich.

Although the initial aims and objectives for the module were not all achieved, the module has formed an important element of the Access to Birmingham Higher Education Learning Module, replacing the Foundations of Learning Module.  The main advantage from this is that the students can access learning materials flexibly either at college or at home, rather than having to attend sessions at the University.  356 pre-entry applicants to the University were provided with academic writing skills support through the online module.  Through working with these materials students are encouraged to analyse written texts and to consider carefully their use of language in writing and presenting for academic purposes.  The module prepares students for the A2B summer academic assignment through its emphasis on understanding and avoiding plagiarism and its insistence on thorough and accurate referencing.  146 students completed the end of module test and these results were presented to Admissions tutors at the time of exam results publication, thereby providing additional information to help tutors when making decisions about borderline applicants. Although the module has met several of its aims, we would now like to take the project forward into a second phase using remaining project funds, in order to further develop the learning experience for the students.","bibo:AuthorList":["CLAD, LDU"],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However it was found that dial-up is not suited to downloading the kind of quantity of material that would be needed for an on-line lecture.

The Chemistry VLE is now at the heart of undergraduate teaching and learning. An example of the student use of the Chemistry VLE is reflected in the tracking data since the beginning of Spring term - all 325 students have used the VLE. The average time of use per student to-date is 4 hours and 7 minutes, with variation between ca. 1 hour up to a maximum of 31 hours. Staff engagement with the Chemistry VLE is also impressive – of the 25 staff involved in undergraduate teaching, 20 self-manage the uploading of their material (after appropriate training), and  2 require help in uploading material but still make use of the VLE. The Chemistry VLE is constantly evolving – each year more of the WebCT tools are used within the VLE, including online submission of assessments and assignments (where possible electronically), use of discussion tools, use of the “My Grades” tool for feedback of student marks, and the use of Questionmark Perception is being piloted as an assessment tool in the area of Spectroscopy, alongside some interactive animations. It is likely that use of Turnitin will begin next academic year, following a recent successful small-scale pilot.","bibo:AuthorList":["CLAD, LDU"],"dc:date":"2009-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Central to this review is an understanding of \u0027development\u0027 and how it has been conceptualised from different perspectives and in different areas. the review starts by examining the meaning of \u0027development\u0027, and different approaches to development, starting from classical understandings to contemporary conceptualisations.The debates leading to the current pre-occupation with \u0027poverty reduction\u0027 are summarised, with a specific section devoted to conceptions of poverty. In section 4, self-styled alternatives to the mainstream areas of development literature are discussed briefly. Finally an outline some areas within the development studies literature that deal with issues of religion/faith is included.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nkurunziza, Emmanuel"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Alkire.

It provides an overview of existing studies, discusses the views of some of the main academic interpreters who have drawn attention to links between Hinduism and issues relevant to development, and refers to relevant religious organizations.The paper is divided into three main sections. The first section aims to clarify what is meant by the \u0027Hindu Tradition\u0027. In the second section, the relationship between Hinduism and some concepts and debates relevant to development (social ethics, including human rights and inequality; political systems; and attitudes towards economics, including notions of wellbeing, poverty and wealth) are explored. The final section contains a more focussed investigation into some important contemporary development issues and the ways that Hindus might approach them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tomalin, Emma"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Kelly D Alley.

Specifically the purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of recent materials produced by relevant Islamic institutions and by some of the main academic interpreters, in order to assist in the development of a basic conceptual understanding of the factors that may influence particular Islamic approaches to development issues encountered in the field. As background, first some trends in the study of Islam are identified, and then a brief history of Islamic civilization is sketched. The paper then moves to explain the basic tenets of the Muslim face, followed by a description of the main Islamic sects. The article finally moves to an exploration of some key pan-Islamic organizations, and their role in development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kroessin, Mohammad R."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A J Abraham.

At its most general level, this review raises the question of whether the Sikh tradition is compatible with or hinders development, as generally understood in the mainstream \u0027development discourse.\u0027Various facets of development are discussed by examining the Sikh scriptural writings on those subjects, and how Sikh norms and beliefs have evolved into particular ethical practices bearing on developmental issues. Thus, the teaching of Sikhism on key development concepts and practices, such as wealth, poverty and inequality, are discussed along with related topics of debt, credit and usury. The paper also tests a popular image of Sikhs\u0027 contribution to rapid economic development in Indian Punjab and juxtaposes it with the contemporary crisis in Punjab agriculture, which is marked by decreasing productivity and an environmental crisis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tatla, Darshan"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Shashi Bala.

Firstly we provide some conceptual clarifications and then go on to examine and compare the key features of the traditional/bureaucratic model and the new public management model (NPM), as well as the theoretical frameworks and values that underpin them. We then move to assess the extent to which the mainstream literature in public administration/management considers aspects of values and beliefs and the role of religion with respect to these. This section also reviews literature that discusses the influence of culture on public administration and development. In section four we review the few studies that have directly addressed the role of religion in public administration/management, and finally, in section five, we attempt to identify research gaps.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shah, Rebecca","Larbi, George","Batley, Richard"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Abbas.

There has been a general belief in much of economic theory that \u0027religious beliefs, practices, and behaviour play no role in the life of homo economicus\u0027 (Tomes, 1985, p.245), and for the large part, the literature reflects a lack of acknowledgement of religion as anything but an obstacle to economic growth, usually placed in the same basket as \u0027culture\u0027 (Anderson, 1988). The \u0027resurgence\u0027 in religion worldwide, however, has contributed to a renewed interest in religion and economics. The development of Islamic economics has led to new approaches to the development of banking, whilst the resurgence of evangelical Christianity in the US has contributed to a rapid development of \u0027literature\u0027 on religion. This paper provides a literature review and discussion of the emerging field of religion and economics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jackson, Paul","Fleischer, Christiane"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Douglas W Allen.

These issues have occupied sociologists of religion since the nineteenth century and are also relevant to our current task of examining the relationship between religion and development. Also considered is the extent to which the debates that have emerged reflect a western context or if they provide theoretical models that are useful to understanding religion and its transformations globally. A second aim will be to discuss research within sociology that is relevant to the theme of religion and development. As there is considerable overlap here with other disciplines this review will focus upon several areas that have not been covered in other reviews - namely the issue of \u0027religions/spiritual capital and social capital\u0027 and, also, with \u0027civil society and social movements\u0027.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tomalin, Emma"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"I Ahmad.

The paper begins with discussion on the (contested) concept of a BME third sector (BME TS) and the existing narrative of distinctiveness; it then goes on to highlight the importance of robust comparative analyses to identify empirical trends of difference between subsectors in order to examine the policy implications for the different subsectors. In an attempt to bring together a disparate collection of material on the BME third sector the remaining section of the paper provides brief overviews of material about different types of organisation that might constitute the BME TS in the broadest sense of the term. These include: refugee and asylum seeker organisations (RCOs), faith based organisations, diasporic immigrant community organisations, black organisations, gypsy and traveller organisations and multicultural organisations. In closing, the paper identifies gaps in the current research base that will be of interest to the wider research community and will inform TSRC\u0027s cross-cutting equality research programme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mayblin, Lucy","Soteri-Proctor, Andri"],"dc:date":"2011-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Afridi.

This includes a lack of resources and skills but also illustrates how in recent years important progress has been made in community development. The paper concludes that the current cutbacks and reduction in resources for community development, combined with new policies that Gypsies and Travellers perceive as being hostile towards them, could undermine progress made. The paper argues that ’positive action’ combined with greater community involvement in service delivery could strengthen the Gypsy and Traveller third sector and foster intercultural dialogue and promote inclusion. Processes evident in other branches of the third sector (McCabe et al., 2010).

Although carers have been identified as an important group in translating personalisation into practice we know very little about how the third sector might support carers in order to make personalisation effective. In this paper we examine the literature to identify the existing evidence base available to examine the impact of personalisation on carers. We find that this evidence is limited at best and therefore set out those areas of further research which we argue are required to inform third sector practice. We illustrate these areas of further research via some real-life case studies in order to root these examples in everyday practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Larkin, Mary","Dickinson, Helen"],"dc:date":"2011-07","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Browning.

A central component of the marketisation thesis is that charities are substituting grants and donations with commercial revenue. However there is no consensus in the existing literature as to whether the two sources of revenue are substitutes or complementary. This paper shows that between 2003 and 2007 there was a significant increase in the proportion of overall revenue attracted from commercial sources by charities in England and Wales. Using our preferred Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimation model we show that the annual persistence of commercial revenue over time was 44%. In particular, a +10% change in grants and donations was associated with a -3.1% change in commercial revenue. Thus commercial revenue is an inelastic substitute for grants and donations. We therefore conclude that charities are succumbing to market forces.","bibo:AuthorList":["McKay, Stephen","Moro, Domenico","Teasdale, Simon","Clifford, David"],"dc:date":"2011-11","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"F Adaman and Y Madra.

It examines who becomes involved in collective action and why, the barriers to mobilisation and, where social movements do emerge, how these are able to sustain mobilisation and broaden their membership base to reflect the interests of the wider community. Evidence from this review suggests the importance of considering the interplay of movement activity and state stability, and of taking into account existing state-society relationships.

Prior to this, theory and practice largely ignored political and social context. Policies and programmes were planned and implemented in a technical manner, based on the presumption that expertise and aid was sufficient to generate growth. The failure of development interventions to produce expected results led to a growing awareness among donors that politics, ‘political will’ and local context matter to development. In order to gain a better understanding of these issues, donors have developed various tools for political and social analysis. This paper provides a detailed overview of five of these tools and frameworks: Power Analysis, Drivers of Change, Strategic Corruption and Governance Analysis, Poverty and Social Impact Analysis, and Problem-Driven Political Economy Analysis.  Under each tool or framework, it discusses how to use the tool (research methods, processes, outputs, and elements of the approach); skills and resources required; the value added and operational impact of the approaches; key challenges; and linkages with other analytical tools.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haider, Huma","Rao, Sumedh"],"dc:date":"2010-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"World Bank.

There is a large body of work on the critical importance of good governance in developing countries which argues that good governance has both intrinsic and instrumental developmental value. Our introduction charts the historical emergence of ‘the good governance agenda’ from the early 1990s to the present day, through narrow technical understandings of governance reform, to the concept of ‘good enough governance’, and on to current wider emphases on political economy approaches to governance.\r\n\r\nThe literature presents a mixed picture, showing that governance reforms have not always resulted in the expected improvements in development outcomes and poverty reduction. This is often argued to be because the success of governance reforms is often conditional on political factors. Other clear messages from the research are that bad governance impacts negatively on the poor and institutions matter for growth and poverty reduction. Policy implications from the research are that donors must take a long-term perspective as change to governance institutions takes place over long time horizons. Donors should also give more attention to the demand-side of governance, rather than focusing exclusively on top-down approaches to reform, as results have often been promising where citizens have been brought into governance interventions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Early, Lucy","Scott, Zoe"],"dc:date":"2010-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47601,"sim:weight":0.528674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44822,"sim:weight":0.459119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.43512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.429933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45075,"sim:weight":0.398161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47546,"sim:weight":0.372867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930217,"sim:weight":0.34735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91023,"sim:weight":0.335302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98922,"sim:weight":0.317711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78006,"sim:weight":0.316407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47461,"sim:weight":0.27895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76506,"sim:weight":0.278203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335180,"sim:weight":0.243818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":114040,"sim:weight":0.18607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176915,"sim:weight":0.164753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337990,"sim:weight":0.137522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":333357,"sim:weight":0.128721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":334014,"sim:weight":0.103691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In some cases the political space for CSOs to engage in issues of security and justice is being increasingly suppressed. Consequently, the success of donor support for security and justice CSOs often depends to a great extent on the political will of respective governments to enable CSOs to work freely. Furthermore, donors who wish to support security and justice CSOs need to take account of the extent to which donor interactions with government security and justice structures may influence the extent and quality of donor interaction with CSOs.\r\n\r\nIn many countries, an understanding of security and justice as conceptualised and defined by donors is lacking amongst civil society – and an understanding of these issues as conceptualised by civil society is often lacking among donors and governments. This scenario even holds true in those countries where civil society as a whole is otherwise vibrant. Consequently, there is a need to increase the basic level of understanding on security and justice matters (both within CSOs and governments), to broaden the strategic community (those working in think tanks or engaged in policy analysis), and to support the development of research capacity and expertise in security and justice areas.\r\n\r\nJoined up approaches to security and justice work are rare in almost all contexts and common/collaborative/networking fora do not exist. Recommendations were made in almost all sub-regions stating that donor approaches should encourage collaboration at the outset between security and justice CSOs and devise schemes that reward or encourage joined up working.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bakrania, Shiv","Gasana, Jean-Marie","Rauch, Janine","Kamenju, Jan","Tadesse, Medhane","Hutchful, Eboe","Andoseh, Priscilla","Malebang, Gabriel","Chakravarthi, Rekha","Karthika, Annapoorna","Chawla, Gautam","Hernandez, Carolina","Pabelina, Karla Mae","D\u0027Amato-Adib, Flavia","Kabbara, Khaled","Ghdayed, Ghaydaa"],"dc:date":"2010-08","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"DFID’s.

The query asked for illustrative examples and lessons of integration;  in particular, examples of integration into armies, integration into non-military forces (police, armed police, intelligence, etc), and creation of new security structures (industrial security forces, border police, etc) into which ex-combatants are then integrated.\r\n\r\nOne of the most contentious current challenges of the Nepali peace process is related to the future of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) - the military organisation of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) – CPN(M). The main parties struggle over the key questions of whether, how and according to what criteria the PLA should be integrated into the Nepali Army (NA) or other security forces. Furthermore, the question of integration of the PLA is linked to other issues, such as the prevalence of other militias and armed groups, and a broader debate on the cornerstone of a national defence strategy.\r\n\r\nThis paper provides a synthesis of key issues and lessons from academic and policy papers focused on issues relating to the integration of non-state and government military forces, as part of a wider peace settlement following civil war. As well as drawing upon existing studies the paper synthesises themes by examining the data from eight primary and fifteen secondary case studies, drawn from various sources.\r\n\r\nAn overarching and consistent theme throughout all case studies examined is the requirement, with integration endeavours, to view the process as the outcome. The integration of non-state military forces into the state security apparatus is an element of wider post-conflict peacebuilding and  statebuilding processes and as such the outcome is rarely predictable. An effective and sustainable solution from one context cannot be assumed to represent a template solution for other contexts. Support to the process of decision-making, and bodies established to implement decisions has been seen to be an effective strategy for external assistance.\r\n\r\nThe paper has highlighted the complex and diverse nature of efforts to integrate ex-combatants into state security forces. There exist as many approaches and solutions as there are contexts in which they have been attempted. An examination of the available case study material has, however, provided some consistent themes that have been highlighted throughout the paper as lessons identified.","bibo:AuthorList":["Knight, Mark"],"dc:date":"2009-08","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"I Aboobaker.

{"identifier":1633027,"ep:Repository":119,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Changing intelligence dynamics in Africa","bibo:abstract":"A common public perception about modern day intelligence services in Africa is that they are mere extensions of the too-often authoritarian leaders under whom they operate. In some cases, the intelligence services appear to tolerate this perception – some would suggest even fuel it – because of the apparent power, access and influence intelligence provides. As despised or ridiculed as intelligence services might be, they often hold a trump card in domestic and international relations, and are quite aware of this relative advantage.\r\n\r\nAnother view is that intelligence services are ineffectual and irrelevant dinosaurs, and that effective power and influence in society and the state lies elsewhere. Genuine power and influence may be, for example, in the hands of the armed forces or political parties or whoever controls the disbursement of finances. In this scenario, intelligence services, if they know what is good for them, had better seek accommodation with these elements.\r\n\r\nThere is a third, alternative and global narrative, one which argues that traditional intelligence services - secret intelligence gathering entities still in their Cold War vestments - are wholly unsuited to anticipating and addressing the complex security threats facing whole countries, regions and blocs. This narrative ponders the proliferation of sources of information and asks whether innovations in information gathering and dissemination are rendering intelligence organisations as just another resource that must compete with other state actors for resources, respect and the space to perform. An extension of this school of thought is that the world in which intelligence services operate is so complex that it will require very different architectures and capacities to make an impact on the kinds of security threats currently faced by countries and the world.\r\n\r\nWhich school of thought is the most valid: intelligence as the power behind the throne, the mediocre bureaucracy that delivers unhelpful intelligence reports, or the entity that must adapt to the times and constantly reinvent itself to stay relevant and to ensure its survival? Though there has been little critical analysis of the role of African intelligence services – not least because they have tended to operate in the political shadows - there is enough anecdotal evidence to suggest that talk of their pervasive powers is reasonably well founded. And yet a more introspective study reveals a more nuanced picture - their power is wielded at varying times and in differing circumstances, to differing and not always spectacular effect.\r\n\r\nThe book discusses the intelligence capacities of both larger, more established states and those of smaller and weaker states. Sometimes such states exist in a regional context, as is the case in the Great Lakes region. Here stronger states (Tanzania, Uganda) coexist with smaller ones (Burundi, Rwanda). Sometimes the size of a state does not necessarily translate into strength; the Democratic Republic of Congo is geographically large, but its state formations are relatively weak and in need of further development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Africa, Sandy","Kwadjo, Johnny"],"dc:date":"2009-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Sjeard Bouta.

{"identifier":1633028,"ep:Repository":119,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"SSR and post-conflict reconstruction: armed wing of state-building?","bibo:abstract":"This paper directly challenges some of the popular SSR mythology that has grown around the UK’s involvement in Sierra Leone and the subsequent policy developments associated with SSR. It raises questions about the underlying political assumptions of the SSR process and contemporary SSR material, much of which lacks analysis of underlying theories of SSR relating to broader state building and construction of a liberal peace.\r\n\r\nUsing a case taken from the reconstruction of Sierra Leone this paper outlines some of the key issues emerging after ten years of reconstruction efforts. Sierra Leone is usually over-cited, but given its importance to any orthodoxy that may be said to exist, it is relevant here. Fundamentally, Sierra Leone remains a relatively small state in West Africa and the fact a viable state remains elusive challenges assumptions about time taken in reconstructing socio-political norms and structures, and also questions state-building as a post conflict approach.\r\n\r\nThis paper will argue that SSR in Sierra Leone was never a developed strategy but came to represent a series of policies that evolved on the ground largely as the result of the interaction of individuals and groups engaged in those early decisions, sometimes against the wishes of Whitehall, but always sharing a ‘direction of travel’. This is an important point in terms of how SSR policy was actually developed and also how approaches come to be seen as being far smoother and well planned with hindsight but also in terms of how policy-makers and academics can learn about social, governance and security processes.\r\n\r\nFinally the paper moves on to analyse what lessons can and can’t be drawn from this experience and what the implications are for SSR going forward. It argues that the example of Sierra Leone as a ‘classic’ post conflict situation is enlightening but also damaging in the sense that any future SSR intervention will face radically different circumstances and needs to take into account broader issues of state-building and in particular recognising the deeply political aspects of what is being done when an international agency engages in SSR.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jackson, Paul"],"dc:date":"2009-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930821,"sim:weight":0.699619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183829,"sim:weight":0.593359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586633,"sim:weight":0.52527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586597,"sim:weight":0.467486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187618,"sim:weight":0.44579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090413,"sim:weight":0.423673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43767,"sim:weight":0.413538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.411063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.411063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.411063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.411063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.411063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.407014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145159,"sim:weight":0.405134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145598,"sim:weight":0.388152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6199817,"sim:weight":0.386738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090401,"sim:weight":0.38479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709917,"sim:weight":0.359807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187744,"sim:weight":0.35452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154411,"sim:weight":0.352364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is the most important issue because the higher the level of secrecy, the harder it is to ascertain and assess the features and performance of the services. In the absence of adequate information, it is impossible to have a meaningful discussion on the role and orientation of the intelligence community, on the need for intelligence reform and on the vital question of whether the services are protecting or undermining the security and freedom of citizens.\r\n\r\nThe subject is vexed because it is characterised by strong competing pressures. On the one hand, certain aspects of the intelligence community and its activities must be kept secret in order to avoid compromising the security of the country, the integrity of operations, and the lives of intelligence officers and their sources. On the other hand, secrecy is antithetical to democratic governance, it prevents full accountability, and it provides fertile ground for abuse of power, illegality and a culture of impunity.\r\n\r\nGiven these competing pressures, many governmental and non-governmental publications on intelligence assert that ‘a reasonable balance must be struck between secrecy and transparency’. This formulation is too abstract and non-committal to be of any value. This briefing note begins with an outline of a democratic approach to intelligence secrecy, and then makes practical recommendations on expanding intelligence transparency without prejudicing the security of the country.\r\n\r\nThe approach and recommendations with reference to South Africa, whose intelligence transformation over the past fifteen years has been substantial, but remains incomplete. In 2008 the Ministerial Review Commission on Intelligence in South Africa released a report that highlighted a number of areas in which the intelligence dispensation was inconsistent with the Constitution. This briefing note is based on that report.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nathan, Laurie"],"dc:date":"2009-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":1633031,"ep:Repository":119,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"No ownership, no commitment: a guide to local ownership of Security Sector reform","bibo:abstract":"A major problem in security sector reform (SSR) has been a lack of local input to and ownership of the emerging reform agenda. Consequently, many donor governments and organisations have made commitments to the principle of local ownership. Yet this has become more a rhetorical device than a guide to donor practice. This paper, by the Crisis States Research Centre, aims to contribute to operationalising donor countries’ policy commitments to local ownership of SSR. It discusses the content and political nature of SSR, and presents guidelines on guaranteeing the engagement of local actors and ensuring the security needs of citizens are met. It identifies obstacles facing SSR and a framework for their analysis. It suggests means by which donors can improve local ownership and makes proposals on institutionalising local ownership in donor governments’ procedures. The paper also draws on case studies of Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Liberia, Sierra Leone and South Africa.\r\n\r\nIn practical terms, local ownership of SSR means that the reform of security policies, institutions and activities in a given country must be designed, managed and implemented by local rather than external actors. Donors should support projects initiated by local actors rather than local actors supporting donor programmes.\r\n\r\nThe principle of local ownership is applicable in both strong and weak developing states, and in sectors other than security, such as development and post-conflict peacebuilding. The absence of local ownership of SSR is inimical to development and democracy. Local ownership should be pursued as a matter of both respect and of pragmatic necessity. Support for local ownership should be the primary objective and outcome of all donor programmes as without it, SSR is bound to fail. Such failure is evident in that:\r\n\r\n- domination and paternalism by external actors generate resentment, resistance and inertia among local actors. Local actors have little commitment to externally imposed products which generally do not reflect local needs, dynamics and resources;\r\n\r\n- a process orientated approach is more likely to yield good results in the long term than a product orientated approach. However good the content of an SSR initiative, a poor process that treats people as objects rather than subjects will lead to flawed outcomes; and\r\n\r\n- while donors justify the absence of local ownership of SSR on the grounds that often local institutions and actors lack capacity and legitimacy, only though enhancing the capacity and legitimacy of such institutions can the security of citizens improve.\r\n\r\nSSR takes place in a variety of environments, this limiting the applicability of generalisations that are often made. The strongest general recommendation that can be made is that donors should avoid a mechanical or formulaic approach to SSR and should instead develop programmes that are flexible and responsive to local actors and conditions. This paper also makes the following policy-relevant observations:\r\n\r\n- the major obstacles facing SSR are complexity, lack of capacity, resistance to change, and instability and insecurity;\r\n\r\n- to enhance local ownership donors should offer support in five areas: research of parliamentary committees that deal with security, security policy and planning units in government, small grants schemes for civil society that focus on SSR, drafting legislation, and comparative SSR exchange and study; and\r\n\r\n- the principle of local ownership should be institutionalised in donor governments through inclusion in their funding, evaluation, reporting and other bureaucratic procedures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nathan, Laurie"],"dc:date":"2007-10","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Louise Andersen.

{"identifier":1633033,"ep:Repository":119,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Religious studies and development: a literature review","bibo:abstract":"This literature review will begin with a section on method and theory in religious studies. Although the Religions and Development research programme is concerned with the intersection between religion and development, it has not been conceived as a \u0027religious studies\u0027 project per-se. However, the debates around method and theory that have occurred within the discipline do offer useful insights into the issues that arise when deciding how to study people\u0027s religious beliefs and practices. While religious studies scholars employ many of the same methodological and analytical tools as scholars in other disciplines, an important focus within method and theory discussions has been the viability of religious studies as a separate discipline. The contours of this discussion are of interest to this programme because they address the key issue of what it is to study \u0027religion\u0027 as a non-believer or outsider. The first part of this paper therefore provides a discussion of the broader theoretical and epistemological concerns of research religion, and the consequences for various interdisciplinary approaches. In the second part of the paper, we turn to look at some of the ways in which religious studies scholars have investigated the influence of religious values and organisations upon social, economic and political change in developing countries. In addition, the main focus of this review will be on regions of specific interest to the RaD programme, namely sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tomalin, Emma"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Chawla.

There has, in recent years, been a vigorous interest in political science in examining the relationship between politics and religion. Surprisingly, perhaps, very little of the current output is focused on developing countries, with attention instead being concentrated on religion and politics in more strategically salient regions - such as the Middle East. This review, however, reflects a more recent trend within development studies to redress this gap. Because the explicitly relevant literature in political science is so scant, we have chosen to pull out threads from  within other areas in the discipline. For this purpose, we have provided an overview of literature on democratisation, good governance, human rights, social capital, conflict and drivers of change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Singh, Gurharpal","Marquette, Heather","Alhassan Alolo, Namawu"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Abe.

Mainstream work in the area of \u0027gender and development\u0027 is primarily concerned with issues such as the social differences between men and women, the economic marginalisation of women, or violence against women as a product of gender bias. However, studies in this field have not, on the whole, taken the impact of religious values, beliefs and organisations upon gender relations seriously. \u0027Gender and development\u0027 discourse is typically both materialist and secularist. Religion is often cited as an impediment to women\u0027s access to employment, healthcare or education, but the dynamics of this interaction are less often the research focus. It is argued that in the mainstream development literature there is a failure to engage with the ways in which some feminists across the globe seek to transform their traditions as a source of empowerment, as well as a lack of interest in the ways in which religion can inform alternative, sometimes more culturally appropriate, understandings of development. The second part of this review discusses research that is concerned with the impact of religion upon the types of concerns that form the content of gender-development debates.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tomalin, Emma"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Abu Daia and J M.

It was motivated by the increasing realization amongst social scientists that there is a need to take faith seriously in understanding the complexity of discourses of development, as promoted by the imperatives of democratic nation building in post-colonial India. Beginning, in the first chapter, with a contextualisation of the study of religion and development in post-colonial India, the review then moves to provide a discussion of the historical forces that shaped religion in the subcontinent; an analysis of the demographic aspects of religious communities in India; a consideration of the role of Roman-Catholic faith-based organizations (FBOs) in the provision of education; a sociological perspective on religion and development in North-east India; and, finally, an exploration of FBOs at the State level in Bihar.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jodhka, Surinder, S.","Mishra, Umakant","John, T.

Traditionally, the role of religion in development has been viewed as both important and non-problematic. The colonial state generally regarded Christianity, and to a lesser extent Islam, as allies in the modernization process: after all, religious groups provided important services, such as education and health, and pacified colonial subjects by urging them to seek spiritual and material self improvement. The post-colonial state also supported religious organizations: it saw them as development partners that silently provided services to citizens, especially in areas the state was unable to reach.  More recently, however, tensions have surfaced between the state and religious groups in Tanzania. In this introduction I identify some key aspects of recent relationships between the Tanzanian state and faith traditions in the country.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mhina, Amos"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A-M Holenstein.

Modern Western political, economic and social structures have emerged as a consequence of the repudiation of religion associated with the Enlightenment and are based on secular principles. Many of these are inimical to Islamic principles, and cannot be adapted to an Islamic society. Muslim societies achieved freedom from colonial rule in the first half of the twentieth century and have sought to construct institutions in conformity with Islam. The development of Islamic economics is part of this process of transition away from Western colonial institutions. This paper is a survey of the literature on Islamic economics, which focuses on the contrasts between Western economic theories and Islamic approaches to the organization of economic affairs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zaman, Asad"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T M Aziz.

It finds that little of the psychological literature published in English focuses on developing countries or religions outside the Judeo-Christian tradition. Nor is there much research that directly links psychology, religion and development. Nevertheless, it is suggested that some of the general psychological literature highlights areas where studies of religion have illuminated some correlations between religious beliefs and practices and various aspects of well-being. The main concepts used in psychological research that have contribute to an understanding of religion are identified as motivation, personality, needs, identity and coping. The paper identifies work on a variety of topics relevant to socio-economic development, broadly defined, especially well-being, happiness and quality of life; physical and mental health; and coping with adverse personal and social circumstances. Other potentially relevant areas include identity and group membership; women\u0027s experience of religion; child development; and politics and corruption.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martin, Faith"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Abe-Kim, Fang Gong and D T.

Most academic attention within India has generally focussed on its role in generating conflict and underpinning societal divisions. Religion has also been seen as an impediment to modernization and an obstacle to the formation of a secular state. The pursuit of secularism in the political sphere fails to recognize that the vast majority of people in South Asia are active practitioners of a religion and that the religious traditions with which they are affiliated encompass the entirety of their lives and are a key source of values and meanings, with the result that for them the public and private spheres are intertwined. This review was undertaken in preparation for a study of how well-being is understood by poor people associated with different religions in India, the roles religion plays in their conceptions of well-being, the resources on which well-being depends and the processes by which it is increased or undermined. The review conceptualizes religion as a source of identity, community and values but notes that the existing literature does not make the links between religion and well-being explicit.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jha, Shreya"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Arjun Appadurai.

Specifically, it explores the beliefs and values that shape visions of the future towards which people strive. The research was prompted by a desire to assess how appropriate western development discourses are in the different religious contexts of developing countries. It aimed to examine how religious values and beliefs are reflected in the teachings imparted by local religious leaders and interpreted by their adherents, with particular reference to key concepts that underlies ideas about \u0027development\u0027, such as inequality, poverty and social justice. This research focused on the daily struggles of Pune\u0027s poor and the role played in these by religious values, beliefs and practices. It explored whether poor people in Pune talk about their society and their visions of the future in terms of the development concerns of mainstream development agencies, such as wellbeing, poverty and inequality, especially gender inequality. It also explored the attitudes of Pune\u0027s poor to some of the tools commonly promoted to achieve a more prosperous and equitable society, for example, gender equality and higher standards of education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bradley, Tamsin","Ramsay, Zara"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D C Ahir.

It documents that, despite a shared emphasis on charity and \u0027helping the other\u0027 within the dominant religions in South Asia, the practical manifestation if this ethic has taken a distinct form in each religious tradition. The consequence is a complex diversity of faith-based organisations (FBOs) in South Asia. Developing an historical account of the rise of FBOs in South Asia, this paper documents the numerous ways in which the state can affect the working of an FBO. The paper develops these arguments with a focus on changes in the working of FBOs in South Asia in response to colonial rule. The study shows that FBOs that are involved in religious education are more likely than others to attract state attention, as they exert power in the public sphere by promoting a specific vision of the world. In this context, the review notes that madrasas are one form of FBO in South Asia that has attracted state-led reform across India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. It also shows that all religious political parties in South Asia maintain a heavy emphasis on welfare work and often establish independent FBOs as part of their party networks. The madrasas and the welfare wings of the religious political parties are thus identified as two forms of FBO in South Asia that provide interesting opportunities to study the relationships between states and religious groups in the three countries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bano, Masooda","Nair, Padmaja"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"H Anheier, M Glasius and M Kaldor.

{"identifier":1633047,"ep:Repository":119,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Allowing for diversity: State-Madrasa relations in Bangladesh","bibo:abstract":"Within South Asia, Bangladesh has apparently been most successful in implementing state administered madrasa modernization: 30 per cent of secondary students in Bangladesh are in Aliya (reformed) madrasas. Given the current emphasis on madrasa reform programmes by many donor agencies, this study attempts to understand the nature of madrasa reforms in Bangladesh and to identify factors that led to acceptance of the programme within the religious establishment. The study argues that Aliya madrasas have indeed been able to combine secular subjects with religious education. On the other hand, while some present day Aliya madrasas might have converted from the traditional Qomi madrasas, as argued by some authors, these state reformed madrasas have failed to displace the Qomi madrasas’ control over the Bangladeshi religious establishment. It is the Qomi madrasa students that are being trained to fill religious positions in Bangladeshi mosques. Aliya madrasa students, on the other hand, are being trained to compete for jobs teaching the children enrolled in the secular schools. The control over religious authority and public interpretation of Islam remains in the hands of the ulema of the Qomi madrasas. Therefore, the study argues that it is misguided to see the Bangladeshi madrasa reform programme as a model for a more liberal interpretation of Islam, which is the focus of current reform efforts. Rather it is a very good model for making madrasas an effective tool for promoting education in conservative societies, where there is a clear demand for combining secular education with a strong religious input. Also, it argues that good financial incentives alone do not explain the rise of Aliya madrasas. The spread of the Aliya madrasa is embedded in a complex interaction between Islam and the Bengali language movement, in pre- and post- liberation (1971) politics, and in the support for the Aliya tradition within an influential segment of the Bangladeshi religious establishment, that is Jamiat-i-Islami. The paper thus argues that in studying madrasa reform programmes, it is important to be clear about the objectives of the reform. Modern interpretations of Islam within madrasas cannot be achieved simply through the introduction of secular subjects. They are only possible if the leadership of Qomi madrasas is successfully convinced of the need for a modern reinterpretation of religious texts and is supported in that process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bano, Masooda"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Ahmed.

By using and adapting tools used in the 1990s for the well-recognised work of LOVAS (Local Voluntary Activity Surveys) we sought to identify all community activities in two small local areas of England. This revealed a diverse range of 58 self-organised activities going on in and around 11 streets of England – groups that do not appear on regulatory listings and thus tend not be included in wider statistical trend analyses on the third sector. Six ‘types’ of below-groups were identified from the study. Most were embedded into their local community and operated within a very specific socio-cultural context delivering services to their immediate local communities. \r\n\r\nOur findings also revealed a combination of ways in which groups obtain resources from their own users by ‘tapping in’, and obtaining resources from others, ‘tapping out’. In addition, the work shows that several of these groups are also distributing resources to others, ‘giving out’. The findings also highlight the importance of the opportunities arising from publically shared-spaces and the support from paid and unpaid staff operating in the buildings that they use.","bibo:AuthorList":["Soteri-Proctor, Andri"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Backus and D Clifford.

This highlighted the lack of  research into the contribution of grass-roots or amateur arts organisations make in communities. This gap in knowledge is substantial, given that there are an estimated 49,000 such groups in England.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with the Universities of Exeter and Glamorgan as well as Voluntary Arts, and with financial support from the Arts and Humanities Research Council’s Connected Communities programme, the Centre undertook a scoping study to assess the lessons from the academic and grey literature across the arts, social sciences and voluntary sector. This identified a range of different impacts and outcomes in terms of amateur arts groups. For individuals, participation in arts based activities ‘for their own sake’ could promote their mental health and wellbeing. Some involved, particularly young people, made the transition from amateur arts to paid employment in the creative industries. Improvements in educational attainment and functioning in the work-place were also reported as positive outcomes in some of the literature.  Claims were also made about the economic role such activities play in communities: through the hire of village halls, the management of local assets, equipment hire or the employment of professional artists in, for example, preparing for performances.  However in this, and other areas, there was a lack of empirical evidence exploring or quantifying the exact nature of impact.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of the impact of amateur arts was explored further with members of grass-roots arts networks at a day conference in October 2011 at Cecil Sharp House (Conference Report – Growing the Grassroots: the contribution of amateur arts to communities). It is the hope of the current partners that further research can be undertaken over 2012 to develop a practical toolkit for assessing the outcomes of amateur arts activities in communities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ramsden, Hilary","Milling, Jane","Phillimore, Jenny","McCabe, Angus","Fyfe, Hamish","Simpson, Robin"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":337716,"sim:weight":0.280056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337245,"sim:weight":0.196632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The project then developed academic skill development modules within the School of Education based upon these results and focus groups held with staff. The modules have been successfully used in the first semester of year one to assist students in making the academic transition to University work.  One of the key elements that the modules aim to develop is students’ ability to reflect upon their work. This is developed in the modules through a structured reflective journal within webCT which is built upon in other modules on the programmes. The reusable learning objects and module webCT section have been adapted and used throughout the College of Social Sciences","bibo:AuthorList":["CLAD, LDU"],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":1633060,"ep:Repository":119,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Contesting ideologies and struggle for authority: State-Madrasa engagement in Pakistan","bibo:abstract":"Thought the current Madrasa Reform Programme launched by the government of Pakistan in 2002 has faced resistance from the ulema, being viewed as the USA\u0027s brainchild, the fact is that Pakistani state\u0027s aspiration to reform Islam is much older. The state\u0027s agenda to reform madrasas, and through that the conservative interpretation of Islam within Pakistan, goes back to the 1960s. From the start the government has pursued a similar objective: to introduce modern subjects to the madrasa curriculum so that the student\u0027s \u0027integrate into the mainstream economy and society\u0027. The fate of the various efforts has been the same: madrasas have successfully resisted state pressure to change their curriculum; even the current madrasa reform programme has managed to enroll less than 200 of the 16,000 registered madrasas. This study highlights two main reasons for the madrasas\u0027 ability to resist state-led reform: one, weak political will due to close links between political legitimacy and Islam; two, strong madrasa leadership resulting from an alliance between senior ulema and a strong base of domestic patronage. The paper reveals that the involvement of bigger madrasas is critical to reform because it gives legitimacy to the reform programme, which in turn makes it more acceptable to smaller madrasas. The paper therefore argues that winning the trust of the senior ulema and making them active partners in developing a reformed curriculum is the only way to develop a reform programme that will have broad-based acceptance among the madrasas. This requires a major shift in the mindset of the government and the donor agencies supporting the madrasa reform programme. Rather than starting their planning from how to secularize the madrasa, they need to accept the madrasas\u0027 primary role as a producer of Islamic knowledge, and then explore how modern interpretations of the religious texts can be included within madrasa education, rather than exclusively focusing on adding modern subjects to the madrasa curriculum.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bano, Masooda"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T Ali.

Post-September 11, concern has heightened in some countries. Reasons for state intervention vary but the usual explanation points to the modernizing ambitions of the secular elite in post-colonial Muslim states who, led by a vision of modernization and nation-building, have aimed to reform religious schools to bring them in line with the demands of modernity. In particular, the reforms have typically sought to introduce secular subjects into the curriculum to enable graduates to compete for jobs in government and the wider economy, pay and train some or all teachers, improve buildings and teaching materials, and, through curriculum reform, create a religious leadership that will propagate a more liberal interpretation of Islam. The State government\u0027s engagement with Islamic Schools in Kano, one of the most populous Muslim states of northern Nigeria, has been essentially tolerant of traditional religious authorities. Drawing on interviews with key informants from the state government, Muslim leaders and informed observers, this study examines the aim and content of attempts to reform various types of Muslim primary and secondary education, by encouraging the adoption of curricula containing both secular and religious subjects and providing other types of support. Unlike elsewhere, in Kano, the State government has not intervened in the higher levels of Islamic education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bano, Massoda"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A U Adamu.

Is their welfare work merely a means of winning votes or does it serve other purposes? An investigation of the welfare programmes of the Jama\u0027at-i-Islami parties in Pakistan and Bangladesh shows that they provide a wide range of charitable, welfare and service provision activities, including health care and training, education, emergency relief, water supply and orphan support. The claim that political parties are \u0027membership groups\u0027 that compete with other membership groups for citizens\u0027 loyalty and resources is borne out by this study. Rather than providing forums for public deliberation on the full range of issues on the public agenda, the religious political parties\u0027 emphasis on creating a cadre of ideologically committed members supports the argument that they are driven primarily by their religious ideology. Their engagement in welfare programmes is regarded as critical to their identity as parties and for mobilizing party members; the possibility that welfare provision might win votes is a less important motivation. This study shows that religious political parties are more complex organizations and have more complicated relationships with the state than is recognized by political theorists.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bano, Masooda"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2007).

Some of the main religious political parties in South Asia are also engaged in the provision of welfare services. Their reasons for doing so are often suspect, although evidence on their motives and strategies is scarce. As part of a larger study of the welfare wings of religious political parties, this research examined the Indian context. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which as head of a coalition has held power at the national level and by itself in several states, is not a religious political party as such. However, it has strong historical and ideological bonds with the self-proclaimed \u0027social organization\u0027, the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), which pursues a \u0027Hindutva\u0027 agenda and has established a large network of affiliates, many involved in social welfare activities. Based on existing sources and extensive interviews with key informants in Madhya Pradesh, where the BJP was in power at the time of the study, and Uttar Pradesh, where it had been ousted some years previously, this study seek to understand why the BJP and RSS have a compelling need for each other and to what extent the BJP, as the political offspring of the RSS, is influenced by it. In addition, it examines the relationship between the BJP and Vidya Bharati Akhil Bharatiya Shiksha Sansthan (VBABSS), the educational affiliate of RSS, in order to obtain a better insight into the BJP\u0027s role in furthering RSS\u0027s \u0027Hindutva\u0027 agenda.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nair, Padmaja"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L K Advani.

It suggests that number of female madrasas has grown because they provide an education for young women from middle income families, which responds to many of the pressures resulting from economic and cultural change. The paper charts the birth, growing demand for and increasing numbers of female madrasas (Islamic schools) in Pakistan since the 1970s, noting that this reflects both demand from families and a positive response by the Islamic educational establishment. It attributes the recent surge in demand for Islamic education among girls who have already completed a secular education (mostly aged 16+) to the uncertain external environment. Globalization, development processes and wider availability of the mass media (especially cable television) are exposing young women from middle income families to western notions of gender equality and increasing their desire to access good jobs. However, the state has failed to provide educational and employment opportunities to match their aspirations. In addition, the erosive effect of cultural change on values that stress the importance of being a good Muslim, wife, mother and daughter concerns religious teachers, parents and many young women alike.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bano, Masooda"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Karachi Andrabi, T Das, J and A I Khwaja.

Instruction in modern interpretation and visualization methods gives students hands-on experience of the unique and exciting views of the subsurface afforded by 3D seismic data. To date, a comparable exercise has employed paper copies of 2D seismic data. The recent introduction of a network licence server by SMT, the US company who donate their seismic software to the School, makes possible for the first time a whole-class exercise using 3D seismic data. The software runs on any PC which can connect to WebCT, assuming it has sufficient graphics capability.","bibo:AuthorList":["CLAD, LDU"],"dc:date":"2007-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The module aims to use a flexible, student-centred approach along with groupwork to develop key subject-specific and transferable skills.  The project mapped directly onto this School’s learning and teaching strategy which places emphasis on responding in a timely and effective way to changes in disciplinary, educational, technological and professional environments and to producing graduates with high quality transferable skills so as to be effective participants in their post-university careers.","bibo:AuthorList":["CLAD, LDU"],"dc:date":"2007-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In this extractive fermentation, pH was precisely controlled by the regulated extraction of acidic products. The solid particles and inorganic salts present in real wastes were not problematic when hydrothermal pre treatment was incorporated. The selective separation of OA from waste-fed fermentations provides a nitrogen free carbon source for further biohydrogen production in a parallel photofermentation. H2 yield could be up to 10 fold enhanced by combining extractive fermentation and photofermentation. Therefore, ED provides the key link in an integrated process (IP) for efficient bioH2 production from organic wastes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Redwood, MD","Orozco, RL","Majewski, AJ","Macaskie, LE"],"dc:date":"2011-10-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"L E Macaskie, V S Baxter-Plant and etc. (2005).

Therefore we must take student induction seriously and where possible improve on current practice. Many students withdraw from higher education during the first few weeks of study. This suggests the importance of starting to build institutional and disciplinary engagement and commitment as early as possible. This can be achieved by helping students to understand the programme they are able to participate in, developing communities of learners and encouraging the formation of friendships and social networks’ (Crosling, 2007:173).

The aim is to consider what potential there is for tapping into diaspora communities and the possible benefits this could have on diasporas themselves and on peacebuilding processes in the homeland. The goal is also to explore and reflect on ways in which reconciliatory attitudes can be encouraged among diaspora communities, as well as their participation in transnational activities.\r\n\r\nThe paper begins by providing a brief overview of diasporas, followed by a discussion on relationships and attitudes within conflict-generated diaspora communities in the aftermath of violence. The paper then explores the various roles that diasporas can play in transitional justice, such as providing input to strategies and participating in established mechanisms; or mobilizing on their own to push for transitional justice measures. This is followed by a brief look at diaspora involvement in other processes of reconciliation, including dialogue and media initiatives. The paper then discusses how integration policies and outcomes in the hostland can influence the views of diasporas and their involvement with the homeland. The paper concludes with challenges related to diaspora participation and some overall reflections.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haider, Huma"],"dc:date":"2012-02","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"F Abdulkadir and R Abdulkadir.

Both have a history together that has included some of the most epic clashes and collaborations of all time. It stands to reason that even though both countries differ markedly in culture, values, socially accepted norms and conventions, there exist similarities as well, especially in the way mass media texts are related to the social domains for which they exist. This critical analysis of two editorial news articles covering the tragedy at Virginia Tech in April of 2007 - one from a Japanese/International perspective and the other from an American perspective - will attempt to show, through critical discourse analysis, how the authors’ texts, reflect and serve to at least contribute to defining the society for which they have been written (Coulthard, 1991).\r\n\r\nNorman Fairclough, who is considered one of the founders of critical discourse analysis, lays the foundation upon which this analysis is built. This analysis will first identify five “aspects of textuality” (Fairclough, 1989) as they appear in the articles, and then will proceed with the Fairclough’s “interpretation of the interaction” in part 2. Part 3 is devoted to explaining how the identification and interpretation above “are inserted in social action” (Fairclough, 1992a and b, 1995). How discourse is shaped by relations of power and ideologies will be brought to light in parts two and three through a critical analysis looking at the following five aspects: 1) visibility and invisibility, 2) consistency, 3) modality, 4) relational processes, and 5) common sense appeal.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jego, Eric H."],"dc:date":"2009-04","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Coulthard, R Moon and A Johnson.

Yet the concept lacks a theoretical context and poses the empirical problem of distinguishing between hybrid and non-hybrid forms.  This paradox – a concept that is widely used but seems to play no useful function in theory building or advice to policy-makers – is explored through a discussion of five theories.  Transaction cost economics, management theory, archetype theory, and institutional theory begin to resolve the theoretical and empirical problems, but significant difficulties remain.  Cultural theory offers a productive solution to the paradox by understanding hybridity as a process through which new possibilities for public administration and governance can emerge within a diverse and plural society.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skelcher, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2012-03","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Henrik P Bang and Eva Sørensen.

There has been some discussion of the meaning of the term \u0027FBO\u0027 in academic circles, but little empirical research has been conducted on how the term is defined in different contexts. In addition, especially in developing countries, there is little research on what kinds of FBOs actually exist, and how they approach and either contribute to or hinder processes of development. Futhermore, little is known about how, if at all, these organizations differ from \u0027secular\u0027 non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This report explores how \u0027faith-based organizations\u0027 are understood and operate in the Pakistani context, with a focus on Karachi and Sindh.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kirmani, Nida","Zaidi , Sarah"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Agha Khan.

They provide greater opportunities for wider participation than traditional approaches to policy making and have to some extent been adapted to local circumstances and integrated with national planning and resource allocation processes. Despite a number of concerns, in a number of countries the ongoing process of PRSP monitoring and review has widened the political space for deliberation and the scope of poor people (or civil society organizations that purport to represent their views) to influence policy and resource allocation. However, despite their organizational strength, legitimacy and grassroots membership, religious organizations in Tanzania and Nigeria have been little involved in such policy consultation processes.Drawing on a number of interviews with various religious and civil society respondents this paper explores the reasons for such neglect. It moves then to detail findings from a number of pilot projects carried out by the RaD programme with networks of religious organizations in Nigeria and Tanzania.","bibo:AuthorList":["Taylor, Michael"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"E Bboh.

This paper emphasises the distinctiveness of the Indian conception of secularism. Experience of the working of Indian democracy over the last six decades reveals that competitive electoral politics compels parties to woo people from different communities. Even when a religious community has an organized religious political party that claims to speak on its behalf, not all sections of the community align themselves with that party. Other axes of identity, such as caste, divide religious communities. The spaces opened by democratic politics and the dynamics it creates need, therefore, to be factored into any discussion of religion and politics. \r\n\r\nRelationships between religion, politics and governance are further examined through case studies from the states of Punjab and Maharashtra of political mobilizations by marginalized groups within three religious communities: Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. Each of these mobilizations involves a cluster of castes and occupational groups in a region. They highlight the different ways in which religion and caste intersect and are implicated in the political process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mahajan, Gurpreet","Jodhka, Surinder, S."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Flavia Agnes.

The question at the heart of the inquiry is whether religion can play the role of a driver for change in terms of pro-poor policy and practice. The study analyses the nature and direction of the latent force and dynamism of the Islamic establishment, especially in its organizational setting, both in government and in opposition. It shows that the state in Pakistan has typically pursued a policy of exploiting the functional uses of Islam as a source of legitimacy in the absence of, or in combination with, a mass mandate. In so doing, it has played on the turf of Islamic groups by seeking to control the production and the spread of the religious message, co-opting the Ulema and managing religious affairs, ranging from levying Islamic taxes to the management of shrines, policies towards madrasas and a role in sectarian conflict. However, it is necessary to go beyond a purely instrumentalist explanation of how religion is used by the state to understand the structural dynamics of Islam as a constant, pervasive and intense force that includes, but at the same time transcends, the manipulations of the ruling elite.","bibo:AuthorList":["Waseen, Mohammed","Mufti, Mariam"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2005).

Whilst both Islam and Christianity in Nigeria provide moral frameworks for people and groups to articulate their demands and critiques of the state, they also challenge institutions provided by the state: the Muslim critique of secular law has led to the introduction of Shari\u0027a penal law in twelve states, while Christian demands for a re-privatization of former mission schools currently under state control might reinforce Muslim disadvantage in the educational sector. The ability of religious organizations to participate in politics and governance is strongly related to patterns of inclusion and exclusion based on linguistic, ethnic and regional identity, as well as on intra-Nigerian struggles to limit the political participation of certain groups through the requirement of \u0027indigeneity\u0027 at State level. As a result, and given the close links between ethnicity and religion, religious competition is interwoven with the other rivalries that dominate Nigerian local politics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nolte, Insa","Danjibo, Nathaniel","Oladeji, Abubakar"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Wale Adebanwi.

The starting point for these studies was the need to examine the implication of the ‘return of religion’ for ‘good governance’, in particular the extent to which religious actors (religious communities, faith based organizations and religious political parties) help or hinder development, especially with respect to pro-poor policy and practice.  \r\n\r\nEach country study provided a historical evaluation of state-religion relationships since independence and detailed case studies of religious actors that assess contemporary patterns of governance and engagement with politics. The analysis draws on the sociological principle of differentiation between politics and religion, set within the comparative historical context of the post-colonial state. What emerges is the gradual demise of the secular state to a condition today in which there are strong pressures towards conflictual relationships between politics and religion in  highly differentiated polities and consensual relationships in integrationist (low differentiated) polities. These pressures, moreover, are reflected in the electoral mobilization of religious identities; state co-option of religious demands; modes of\r\nresistance by marginalized groups through ‘religions of revolution’; and, post-9/11, new discourses and policy innovations centred on religious identities. Historically, the ‘crisis of governance’ in these states from the late 1970s onwards played a critical role in undermining the coalition of social and political forces that had underpinned the post-colonial secular state, in the process creating new public spaces for religious actors to occupy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Singh, Gurharpal"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Scott Appleby.

This paper explores how the new ‘myth’ about the relationship between religion and corruption is based on assumptions not borne out through the evidence. The paper then examines whether a discursive relationship exists instead, and what the significance of such a relationship might be.\r\n\r\nBased on a review of several studies of the statistical relationships between religion and corruption, the paper concludes that the evidence for a causal relationship between religion (or type of religion) and either higher or lower levels of corruption is in no way convincing. The methodologies that have been employed thus far are insufficient for proving – one way or another – a causal relationship. This literature is largely quantitative, with a dearth of empirical, fieldwork-based evidence. The results are often contradictory, depending upon which dataset has been used, which raises important methodological issues. The literature is tentative at best, offering comparisons between various datasets and pointing towards possible explanations, sometimes rooted in theory, sometimes not. The\r\ndata used are often flawed, making the explanations that are advanced problematic. The data are aggregated at the country level; they do not reveal intra-country variations and cannot tell us anything about how individuals’ attitudes towards corruption are formed, the impact of religious (and other socio-cultural influences) on attitude formation, or the ways that individuals condemn or justify corrupt behaviour using the language of religion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marquette, Heather"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Allafrica com.

{"identifier":8771854,"ep:Repository":119,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Corruption, religion and moral development","bibo:abstract":"Lacking in much of the current research on religion and corruption is a sense that there may be alternative ways that people view corruption, which in their minds may be moral, and that if we are to truly develop an understanding of how religion influences people’s attitudes and behaviour towards corruption, we must start from a critical and interpretive perspective at the individual level of analysis. This paper argues that the methodologies used in many current studies are not adequate to study what is ultimately an individual decision, and one that is at least in part informed by a person’s own ethical and moral standpoint. As such, starting research with the mindset that particular types of activities are corrupt, and thus ‘wrong’, may prevent researchers from uncovering why people develop particular attitudes to corruption, or why they choose to behave in a way labelled by some as corrupt.\r\nIf corruption research is to explore some of these issues at the individual, as well as the regional and national levels, it is important to learn from existing work that examines how attitudes are formed, both on religion and the impact that religion has on attitudes to moral issues and on moral reasoning. A number of studies, few of which deal specifically with corruption, are reviewed in order to establish useful ways forward for corruption researchers.\r\n\r\nResearch on religion and attitudes towards deviant behaviour shows that individuals’ interpretation of messages on moral behaviour is significant in determining their acceptance or rejection of deviancy. However, there is little evidence to suggest that the religious reject behaviour that is ‘anti-social’ any more than the non-religious. Indeed, there is little evidence to suggest that religion, in terms of religious content, impacts upon individuals’ attitudes to public morality. Membership of a religious community\r\nthat rejects behaviour seen as being ‘corrupt’ seems more likely to have an impact, but a lot depends upon whether members of the community are encouraged to use religious principles to think through moral issues, or to interpret religious teachings literally.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marquette, Heather"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Alolo Al-hassan and N.

Religion provides many with a language of ethics and, often, an actual \u0027list\u0027 of rules by which to live, some of which may be relevant to fighting corruption. Problematically, however, many of the world\u0027s most corrupt countries also rank highly in terms of levels of religiosity, suggesting that the relationships between widespread religious adherence and levels of corruption are not straightforward. Attempts to reduce corruption have had limited success, leading to a renewed interest in the role hat religious values might play in future initiatives. This study assembles a picture of people\u0027s religious beliefs, values, perceptions of corruption, and notions of tradition and modernity, based on extensive semi-structured interviews in several locations across India.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pavarala, Vinod","Malik, Kanchen"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J V Abueva.

Hindu violence against Muslims has roots in the Partition of India and Pakistan but also, more recently, in the emergence of a Hindu nationalist agenda.

It sets case studies of two \u0027contested cities\u0027 -Jhang and Gilgit- within a wider national and international framework, examining the historical roots of sectarian conflict, the trajectory and nature of the violence, and the restoration of relative calm. It draws on existing analyses of sectarian conflict in Pakistan and case studies in the two cities based on individual and group interviews with key informants, including political and religious leaders, government officials and residents. it argues that unless peace-building tackles the underlying dynamics of intra-religious conflict, it results in negative peace rather than conflict transformation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Waseem, Mohammad","Kamran, Tahir","Ali, Mukhtar Ahmed","Riikonen, Katja"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Tor H Aase.

Because much of the violence has been urban and because the violence itself and subsequent recovery and reconstruction are strongly influenced by contextual factors, the research was conducted in two cities: Kano in northern, predominantly Muslim Kano state (1999 and 2004), and Jos, the capital of Plateau State, in the religiously mixed Middle Belt (2001 and 2008). Hostility between Christians and Muslims in Nigeria has deep historical roots and is linked to politics characterized by struggles between the northern and southern states over access to federal power and resources, inequalities in access to opportunities and different views about legal regimes. Over the last thirty years, the frequency of violence with a religious dimension appears to have increased. It pits Muslims against Christians and Islamic sects against each other. The study used secondary sources, including the media, semi-structured interviews with a wide range of informants and focus group discussions to ascertain the role of religion in the causes, triggers and consequences of the violence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Best, Shedrack Gaya","Rakodi, Carole"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Mahdi Adamu.

{"identifier":8771860,"ep:Repository":119,"dc:type":["Teaching Resource","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Individual Rights and the Democratic Boundary Problem","bibo:abstract":"Boundary problems arguably are primary in democratic theory. Until we settle who ‘the people’ are, numerous questions around rule by the people cannot themselves be settled. Recent accounts have advocated extending participatory boundaries outward, up to the fully global level, in order to better match decision makers to decision takers in a more integrated global system, or to appropriately account for coercion to which all are said to be subjected. Some critics of these accounts would give much stronger emphasis to national or other bonds between democratic participants. They would limit inclusion and participation accordingly. Defended here is an approach that is focused on enhancing individual rights protections through extending political boundaries. It would challenge the idea, implicit in ‘all-affected’ and ‘all-subjected’ approaches, that expanding the franchise is the appropriate tool for protecting participants’ vital interests. It challenges also any strong necessity claims for shared national sentiment to sustain democratic rule. The case of Turkish accession to the European Union is given some attention, for ways in which it highlights issues around the rights protections at stake, as well as ways in which some problematic identity questions lie at the root of much resistance to boundary extensions. While the application of a rights-based approach to the boundary problem will not be so straightforward in all cases, the approach can significantly inform participatory inclusion and institutional design at various levels of governance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cabrera, Luis"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Whilst religious organizations\u0027 involvement in welfare and charitable activities has a long history, the objectives of the religion reform movements and faith-based organizations that emerged during the colonial era were to strengthen their respective faith communities, drawing clearer boundaries between them, fighting against perceived \u0027social evils\u0027, and gaining legitimacy vis-a-vis the colonial state. The nationalist struggles and coming of independence significantly changed this social context. After independence, a state-centred development model, whilst it did not displace religious organizations from some of their traditional spheres of operation, deterred further growth in the numbers of FBOs.\r\n\r\nThe new communitarian and religious consciousness that has emerged since the 1980s has, however, resulted in growing numbers of FBOs that participate in the so-called \u0027secular spheres\u0027, including education, health and community development. Little systematic information in available on the extent and characteristics of these organizations and their activities. This preliminary study therefore sought to \u0027map\u0027 the scale and characteristics of FBOs and to provide an overview of their engagement in development activities in contemporary India. Limited resources led to a focus on the cities of Pune and Nagpur in Maharashtra, an Indian state with a large Hindu majority and a number of religious minorities - a typical religious demography. Using a snowball sampling approach, and despite definitional difficulties and the contentious nature of the label \u0027faith-based\u0027 in India, 133 organizations were identified and interviewed. While this is not necessarily a representative sample, it reveals some of the organizations\u0027 key characteristics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jodhka, Surinder, S.","Bora, Pradyumna"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"W Anderson and S D Damle.

The structural refinements showed that all samples adopt the T΄-structure, in contrast to the previous observation of the T -structure for Sr2CuO2F2+δ, when the phase is synthesised using F2 gas. The difference can be related to the lack of interstitial fluoride ions (δ \u003d0) in the samples synthesised via fluorination with the polymers, and hence highlights that the T- structure is only formed if there is partial oxidation of Cu through incorporation of interstitial fluoride ions (δ\u003e0), as is the case when F2 gas is employed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Slater, Peter R","Heap, Richard"],"dc:date":"2009-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S C Bhagava and B N Wani.
