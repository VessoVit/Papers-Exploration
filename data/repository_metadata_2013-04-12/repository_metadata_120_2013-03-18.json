Participants (N \u003d 93) were physically active female university students. State self-objectification was manipulated by participants wearing tight revealing exercise attire (experimental condition) or baggy exercise clothes (control condition). Significant interactions emerged predicting depression, anger, fatness, and satisfaction with body shape and size. For participants in the self-objectification condition who had low (as opposed to high) appearance evaluation, low self-esteem was associated with high depression, anger, and fatness and low satisfaction with body shape and size. In contrast, for participants with high self-esteem, these mood and body satisfaction states were more favorable irrespective of their levels of appearance evaluation. For female exercisers, self-esteem-enhancing strategies may protect against some of the negative outcomes of self-objectification.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thøgersen-Ntoumani, Cecilie","Ntoumanis, Nikos","Cumming, Jennifer","Bartholomew, Kimberley","Pearce, Gemma"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101201,"sim:weight":0.605738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101471,"sim:weight":0.605738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98634,"sim:weight":0.336887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23812,"sim:weight":0.322949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18997,"sim:weight":0.267378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23524,"sim:weight":0.264244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.249885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.249779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.237723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.237723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.237723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.237723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.237723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.237723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.237723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.237723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.237723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.237723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.237723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.237723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Systematic reviews of good methodological quality are essential to provide valid inferences and to produce usable evidence summaries to guide management. This review assesses the methodological features of existing systematic reviews in maternal medicine, comparing Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews in maternal medicine. \n \nMethods \nMedline, Embase, Database of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) were searched for relevant reviews published between 2001 and 2006. We selected those reviews in which a minimum of two databases were searched and the primary outcome was related to the maternal condition. The selected reviews were assessed for information on framing of question, literature search and methods of review. \n \nResults \nOut of 2846 citations, 68 reviews were selected. Among these, 39 (57%) were Cochrane reviews. Most of the reviews (50/68, 74%) evaluated therapeutic interventions. Overall, 54/68 (79%) addressed a focussed question. Although 64/68 (94%) reviews had a detailed search description, only 17/68 (25%) searched without language restriction. 32/68 (47%) attempted to include unpublished data and 11/68 (16%) assessed for the risk of missing studies quantitatively. The reviews had deficiencies in the assessment of validity of studies and exploration for heterogeneity. When compared to Cochrane reviews, other reviews were significantly inferior in specifying questions (OR 20.3, 95% CI 1.1–381.3, p \u003d 0.04), framing focussed questions (OR 30.9, 95% CI 3.7- 256.2, p \u003d 0.001), use of unpublished data (OR 5.6, 95% CI 1.9–16.4, p \u003d 0.002), assessment for heterogeneity (OR 38.1, 95%CI 2.1, 688.2, p \u003d 0.01) and use of meta-analyses (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.3–10.8, p \u003d 0.02). \n \nConclusion \nThis study identifies areas which have a strong influence on maternal morbidity and mortality but lack good quality systematic reviews.

Whereas in the monkey, proprioceptive eye position signals have been recorded in the somatosensory cortex, in humans, no brain site has yet been associated with eye position. We aimed to disrupt the proprioceptive representation of the right eye in the left somatosensory cortex, presumably located near the representation of the right hand, using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Head-fixed subjects reported their perceived visual straight-ahead position using both left and right eye monocular vision, before and after 15 min of 1 Hz rTMS. rTMS over left somatosensory but not over left motor cortex shifted the perceived visual straight ahead to the left, whereas nonvisual detection of body midline was unchanged for either brain area. These results can be explained by the underestimation of the angle of gaze of the right eye when fixating the target. To link this effect more tightly to an altered ocular proprioception, we applied a passive deviation to the right eye before the visual straight-ahead task. Passive eye displacement modulated the shift in the perceived straight ahead induced by somatosensory rTMS, without affecting the perceived straight ahead at baseline or after motor cortex rTMS. We conclude that the anterior parietal cortex in humans encodes eye position and that this signal has a proprioceptive component.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miall, R.

Humans rely on near-optimal integration in decision-making tasks (involving e.g., auditory, visual, and/or tactile afferents), and some support for these processes has also been provided for discrete sensorimotor tasks. Here, we tested optimal integration during the continuous execution of a motor task, using a cyclical bimanual coordination pattern in which feedback was provided by means of proprioception and augmented visual feedback (AVF, the position of both wrists being displayed as the orthogonal coordinates of a single cursor). Assuming maximum likelihood integration, the following predictions were addressed: (1) the coordination variability with both AVF and proprioception available is smaller than with only one of the two modalities, and should reach an optimal level; (2) if the AVF is artificially corrupted by noise, variability should increase but saturate toward the level without AVF; (3) if the AVF is imperceptibly phase shifted, the stabilized pattern should be partly adapted to compensate for this phase shift, whereby the amount of compensation reflects the weight assigned to AVF in the computation of the integrated signal. Whereas performance variability gradually decreased over 5 d of practice, we showed that these model-based predictions were already observed on the first day. This suggests not only that the performer integrated proprioceptive feedback and AVF online during task execution by tending to optimize the signal statistics, but also that this occurred before reaching an asymptotic performance level.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miall, R.

The study additionally examined the role of coping strategies in the persistence of goal-directed effort. Structural equation modeling analysis with a sample of 97 British athletes indicated that start-of-season autonomous goal motives were linked to midseason effort, which subsequently predicted end-of-season goal attainment. Attainment was positively related to changes in psychological need satisfaction, which, in turn, predicted changes in emotional well-being. In a second model, autonomous and controlled motives positively predicted task- and disengagement-oriented coping strategies, respectively. In turn, these strategies were differentially associated with effort. The findings provide support for contextual adaptations of the self-concordance model and demonstrate the role of coping strategies in the goal striving process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Alison L.","Ntoumanis, Nikos","Duda, Joan L","Vansteenkiste, Maarten"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19167,"sim:weight":0.46429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387053,"sim:weight":0.376895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53691,"sim:weight":0.363026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18992,"sim:weight":0.343256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76502,"sim:weight":0.321466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19168,"sim:weight":0.309341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19127,"sim:weight":0.304797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631186,"sim:weight":0.300828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19142,"sim:weight":0.295321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19194,"sim:weight":0.289075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52534,"sim:weight":0.286815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19152,"sim:weight":0.278075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.271698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103148,"sim:weight":0.25619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98621,"sim:weight":0.254328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930580,"sim:weight":0.23818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102909,"sim:weight":0.223179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106970,"sim:weight":0.215872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.212988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.212864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The experimental group included two PE teachers who were first educated on the benefits of an autonomy supportive style and then followed an individualised guidance programme during the 8 lessons of a teaching cycle. Their behaviours were observed and rated along 3 categories (i.e., autonomy supportive, neutral and controlling) and were subsequently compared to those of three teachers who formed the control condition. The results showed that teachers in the experimental group used more autonomy supportive and neutral behaviours than those in the control group, but no difference emerged in relation to controlling behaviours.

The correlation coefficient for the raw- and value-added scores of these 457 schools is around +0.75. Scatterplots show that there are no low attaining schools with average or higher value-added, and no high attaining schools with below average value-added. At least some of the remaining scatter is explained by the small size of some schools. Although some relationship between these measures is to be expected – so that schools adding considerable value would tend to have high examination outcome scores – the relationship shown is too strong for this explanation to be considered sufficient. Value-added analysis is intended to remove the link between a schools’ intake scores and their raw-score outcomes at KS2. It should lead to an estimate of the differential progress made by pupils, assessed between schools. In fact, however, the relationship between value-added and raw scores is of the same size as the original relationship between intake scores and raw-scores that the value-added is intended to overcome. Therefore, however appealing the calculation of value-added figures is, their development is still at the stage where they are not ready to move from being a research tool to an instrument of judgement on schools. Such figures may mislead parents, governors and teachers and, even more importantly, they are being used in England by OFSTED to pre-determine the results of school inspections.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gorard, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2008-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19173,"sim:weight":0.671249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82296,"sim:weight":0.607679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19203,"sim:weight":0.547867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.534254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.518688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82850,"sim:weight":0.517521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45828,"sim:weight":0.512744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94289,"sim:weight":0.506773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3214,"sim:weight":0.487465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.460649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2859,"sim:weight":0.457275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50117,"sim:weight":0.439558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43722,"sim:weight":0.426817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2851,"sim:weight":0.418357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.410381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.40125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270152,"sim:weight":0.392789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.390658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.371014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49910,"sim:weight":0.346414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Rejection of schooling is therefore very far from being an irrational or ill-considered act. The paper reviews evidence supporting this argument including both the failure of schools to protect young people from danger and violence and also their direct role in actively perpetrating \nviolence and threatening the safety of those they are there to protect. The paper ends by arguing that disaffection with schooling stems from its fundamental nature and purposes \nwhich have been shaped by its historical origins.

Three themes emerge: the nature and purpose of the school science curriculum, the recruitment of science undergraduates, and the teaching of science in schools. The review suggests that many of the concerns which pre-occupy us today, such as the perceived ‘quality’ of the science teaching workforce, are the very same that existed when science was first introduced as a school subject. This raises issues about the role of policy in influencing educational change more generally but also questions whether there ever was a ‘golden age’ for science education in the UK.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Emma"],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":82272,"sim:weight":0.520884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82321,"sim:weight":0.509213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.485495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.452805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101495,"sim:weight":0.441442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.439056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101576,"sim:weight":0.395527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101496,"sim:weight":0.394337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383522,"sim:weight":0.345689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929827,"sim:weight":0.331273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46631,"sim:weight":0.312089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82037,"sim:weight":0.307511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5418,"sim:weight":0.307316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81967,"sim:weight":0.299196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106236,"sim:weight":0.297388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1286,"sim:weight":0.292855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48236,"sim:weight":0.290878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100473,"sim:weight":0.274131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.272337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382009,"sim:weight":0.270988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Both authors present a series of propositions about quality standards in education research. Cook’s propositions, as might be expected, concern the importance of experimental trials for establishing the security of causal evidence, but they also include some important practical and acceptable alternatives such as regression discontinuity analysis. Gorard’s propositions, again as might be expected, tend to place experimental trials within a larger mixed method sequence of research activities, treating them as important but without giving them primacy. The paper concludes with a synthesis of these ideas, summarising the many areas of agreement and clarifying the few areas of disagreement. The latter include what proportion of available research funds should be devoted to trials, how urgent the need for more trials is, and whether the call for more truly mixed methods work requires a major shift in the community.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gorard, Stephen","Cook, Thomas"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.5224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.504554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.498787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.497237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.494649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.460214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.453498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.453228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.449671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69411,"sim:weight":0.449411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.440455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103044,"sim:weight":0.434615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.431005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47362,"sim:weight":0.426708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.424396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.41985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.386984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19206,"sim:weight":0.286167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47545,"sim:weight":0.246112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46829,"sim:weight":0.187389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The downhill trajectory of English university continuing education in the first decade of the twenty-first century is compared with the apparent buoyancy of the situation in New Zealand during the same period. The paper discusses some of the contextual factors which may have contributed to sustaining continuing education in New Zealand, against the tide of developments elsewhere, and in spite its subjection to the influence of neoliberal policies since the 1980s. These factors include: an ethos of public dissemination of knowledge, an acknowledgement of the universities’ role as ‘critic and conscience’ of society, a broad commitment to educational equality and an approach which has been strategic as well as pragmatic. The paper describes developments in one New Zealand continuing education department between 2006 and 2010 as it experiences further institutional and political change. The author concludes that, in spite of having demonstrated considerable resilience, the current structures and activities of continuing education departments in New Zealand are as fragile as they have been shown to be in England. Possible responses to the current situation are discussed and ‘radical hope’ (Brookfield 2005) is advocated as the university-based adult educators’ response in difficult times. Radical hope, founded on critical theory, involves recognising and challenging the assumptions of neoliberalism, as well as critical praxis (Carr and Kemmis 1986), and a reaffirmation on the part of academics and adult educators of the political nature of adult education (Freire 1972; Crowther et al 2005; Martin 2008; Wallace 2008).","bibo:AuthorList":["Bowl, Marion"],"dc:date":"2010-11-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.323238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387169,"sim:weight":0.316365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1613,"sim:weight":0.300176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81572,"sim:weight":0.276052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383597,"sim:weight":0.270844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.258023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2909,"sim:weight":0.241297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18068,"sim:weight":0.229303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101576,"sim:weight":0.226923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3533,"sim:weight":0.220731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16185,"sim:weight":0.220482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.220179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.220065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.219041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81717,"sim:weight":0.210318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930934,"sim:weight":0.207689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45818,"sim:weight":0.207409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48298,"sim:weight":0.206645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.204887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383645,"sim:weight":0.201489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here, we employ a commonly used rat cell line for VSMCs (A7r5 cells) to investigate the effects of glucose on the expression and activity of the SPCA1 (secretory pathway Ca\\(^{2+}\\)-ATPase 1; also known as ATP2C1), which is a P-type Ca\\(^{2+}\\) pump located in the Golgi apparatus that plays a key role in the secretory pathway. Our results show that mRNA expression levels of SPCA1 are significantly increased in A7r5 cells cultured in high glucose (25.0 mM)-supplemented medium compared with normal glucose (5.55 mM)-supplemented medium. SPCA1 protein expression levels and thapsigargin-insensitive Ca\\(^{2+}\\)-dependent ATPase activity were also consistent with a higher than normal expression level of SPCA1 in high-glucose-cultured A7r5 cells. Analysis of AVP (arginine-vasopressin)-induced cytosolic Ca\\(^{2+}\\) transients in A7r5 cells (after pre-treatment with thapsigargin) showed faster rise and decay phases in cells grown in high glucose medium compared with cells grown in normal glucose medium, supporting the observation of increased SPCA expression/activity. The significant levels of both Ca\\(^{2+}\\)-ATPase activity and AVP-induced Ca\\(^{2+}\\) transients, in the presence of thapsigargin, indicate that SPCA must play a significant role in Ca\\(^{2+}\\) uptake within VSMCs.

We have shown previously that the Proline-Rich Homeodomain protein (PRH/Hex) self-assembles to form oligomeric complexes that bind to arrays of PRH binding sites with high affinity and specificity. We have also shown that many PRH target genes contain suitably spaced arrays of PRH sites that allow this protein to bind and regulate transcription. Here, we use analytical ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy to further characterize PRH oligomers. We use the same techniques to show that PRH oligomers bound to long DNA fragments self-associate to form highly ordered assemblies. Electron microscopy and linear dichroism reveal that PRH oligomers can form protein–DNA fibres and that PRH is able to compact DNA in the absence of other proteins. Finally, we show that DNA compaction is not sufficient for the repression of PRH target genes in cells. We conclude that DNA compaction is a consequence of the binding of large PRH oligomers to arrays of binding sites and that PRH is functionally and structurally related to the Lrp/AsnC family of proteins from bacteria and archaea, a group of proteins formerly thought to be without eukaryotic equivalents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Soufi, A.","Sawasdichai, A.","Shukla, A.","Noy, P.","Dafforn, T.","Smith, C.","Jayaraman, P.-S.","Gaston, K."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4185139,"sim:weight":0.227894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.212448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709980,"sim:weight":0.206776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154372,"sim:weight":0.202201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99431,"sim:weight":0.192076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.182698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47658,"sim:weight":0.181349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154366,"sim:weight":0.178597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47359,"sim:weight":0.175373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98590,"sim:weight":0.174476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48460,"sim:weight":0.160631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98670,"sim:weight":0.158318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98501,"sim:weight":0.154672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.153404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98668,"sim:weight":0.151417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98866,"sim:weight":0.145796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.139997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182562,"sim:weight":0.13935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.124618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336873,"sim:weight":0.124285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

When multiple potential sites of nitration exist, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods provide unique tools to locate the nitro-tyrosine(s) precisely. Electron capture dissociation (ECD) is a powerful MS/MS method, different in its mechanisms to the “slow-heating” threshold fragmentation methods, such as collision-induced dissociation (CID) and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD). Generally, ECD provides more homogeneous cleavage of the protein backbone and preserves labile PTMs. However recent studies in our laboratory demonstrated that ECD of doubly charged nitrated peptides is inhibited by the large electron affinity of the nitro group, while CID efficiency remains unaffected by nitration. Here, we have investigated the efficiency of ECD versus CID and IRMPD for top-down MS/MS analysis of multiply charged intact nitrated protein ions of myoglobin, lysozyme, and cytochrome c in a commercial Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer. CID and IRMPD produced more cleavages in the vicinity of the sites of nitration than ECD.

Lower fornix shortening is often documented subjectively or semi-objectively, whereas upper forniceal obliteration is seldom quantified. Although tools such as fornix depth measurers (FDMs) have been described, their designs limit upper fornix measurement. The purpose of this study was to custom-design a FDM to evaluate the upper fornix and to assess variability in gauging fornix depth. \r\n \r\nMethods A polymethylmethacrylate FDM was constructed using industry-standard jewellery computer software and machinery. Two observers undertook a prospective independent evaluation of central lower fornix depth in a heterogeneous cohort of patients with clinically normal and abnormal conjunctival fornices both subjectively and by using the FDM (in mm). Upper central fornix depth was also measured. Agreement was assessed using Bland–Altman plots. \r\n \r\nResults Fifty-one eyes were evaluated. There was 100% intraobserver agreement to within 1 mm for each observer for lower fornix measurement. The mean difference in fornix depth loss using the FDM between observer 1 and 2 was 1.19%, with 95% confidence of agreement (±2SD) of −15% to +20%. In total, 86% (44/51) of measurements taken by the two observers agreed to within 10% of total lower fornix depth (ie, ±1 mm) versus only 63% (32/51) of the subjective measurements. Mean upper fornix difference was 0.57 mm, with 95% confidence of agreement of between −2 and + 3 mm. \r\n \r\nConclusions This custom-designed FDM is well tolerated by patients and shows low intraobserver and interobserver variability. This enables repeatable and reproducible measurement of upper and lower fornix depths, facilitating improved rates of detection and better monitoring of progression of conjunctival scarring.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Geraint P.","Saw, Valerie P J","Saeed, Tariq","Evans, Simon T","Cottrell, Paul","Curnow, S.

The source of arabinose ultimately destined for deposition into cell wall AG or LAM, originates exclusively from phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (pRpp), a central metabolite which is also required for other essential metabolic processes, such as de novo purine and pyrimidne biosynthesis. In M. tuberculosis, a single pRpp synthetase enzyme (Mt-PrsA) is soley responsible for the generation of pRpp, by catalysing the transfer of pyrophosphate from ATP to the C1 hydroxyl position of ribose-5-phosphate.

In this study, we show that phosphorylation of CLEC-2 by the snake toxin rhodocytin is abolished in the absence of the tyrosine kinase Syk but is not altered in the absence of the major platelet Src family kinases, Fyn, Lyn, and Src, or the tyrosine phosphatase CD148, which regulates the basal activity of Src family kinases. Further, phosphorylation of CLEC-2 by rhodocytin is not altered in the presence of the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2, even though PLCγ2 phosphorylation and platelet activation are abolished. A similar dependence of phosphorylation of CLEC-2 on Syk is also seen in response to stimulation by an IgG mAb to CLEC-2, although interestingly CLEC-2 phosphorylation is also reduced in the absence of Lyn. These results provide the first definitive evidence that Syk mediates phosphorylation of the CLEC-2 hemITAM receptor with Src family kinases playing a critical role further downstream through the regulation of Syk and other effector proteins, providing a new paradigm in signaling by YXXL-containing receptors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Severin, S.","Pollitt, A.

The relationship between body dissatisfaction and obesity is well documented in older children and adults, but is less clear in young children, particularly South Asians. A better understanding of this relationship in young South Asian children will inform the design and delivery of obesity intervention programmes. The aim of this study is to describe body image size perception and dissatisfaction, and their relationship to weight status in primary school aged UK South Asian children. \n \nMethods \nObjective measures of height and weight were undertaken on 574 predominantly South Asian children aged 5-7 (296 boys and 278 girls). BMI z-scores, and weight status (underweight, healthy weight, overweight or obese) were calculated based on the UK 1990 BMI reference charts. Figure rating scales were used to assess perceived body image size (asking children to identify their perceived body size) and dissatisfaction (difference between perceived current and ideal body size). The relationship between these and weight status were examined using multivariate analyses. \n \nResults \nPerceived body image size was positively associated with weight status (partial regression coefficient for overweight/obese vs. non-overweight/obese was 0.63 (95% CI 0.26-0.99) and for BMI z-score was 0.21 (95% CI 0.10-0.31), adjusted for sex, age and ethnicity). Body dissatisfaction was also associated with weight status, with overweight and obese children more likely to select thinner ideal body size than healthy weight children (adjusted partial regression coefficient for overweight/obese vs. non-overweight/obese was 1.47 (95% CI 0.99-1.96) and for BMI z-score was 0.54 (95% CI 0.40-0.67)). \n \nConclusions \nAwareness of body image size and increasing body dissatisfaction with higher weight status is established at a young age in this population. This needs to be considered when designing interventions to reduce obesity in young children, in terms of both benefits and harms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pallan, Miranda J","Hiam, Lucinda C","Duda, Joan L","Adab, Peymane"],"dc:date":"2011-01-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75581,"sim:weight":0.636021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98634,"sim:weight":0.600397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44016,"sim:weight":0.547234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43962,"sim:weight":0.470492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43840,"sim:weight":0.468708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43964,"sim:weight":0.466232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43619,"sim:weight":0.445052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.444865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43057,"sim:weight":0.443184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26489,"sim:weight":0.430358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43848,"sim:weight":0.429665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18046,"sim:weight":0.428665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23524,"sim:weight":0.417331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57812,"sim:weight":0.413038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145844,"sim:weight":0.404822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75341,"sim:weight":0.382115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85180,"sim:weight":0.369346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46324,"sim:weight":0.334859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43944,"sim:weight":0.316047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23812,"sim:weight":0.29331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Our aim was to review evidence about who uses self-tests and other self-care activities (over-the-counter medicine, private sector,complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), home blood pressure monitors). \nMethods: During April 2007, relevant bibliographic databases (Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, PsycINFO,British Nursing Index, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Sociological Abstracts, \nInternational Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Arthritis and Complementary Medicine Database, \nComplementary and Alternative Medicine and Pain Database) were searched, and potentially relevant studies were reviewed against eligibility criteria. Studies were included if they were published during the last 15 years and identified factors, reasons or characteristics associated with a relevant activity among UK adults. Two independent reviewers used proformas to assess the \nquality of eligible studies. \nResults: 206 potentially relevant papers were identified, 157 were excluded, and 49 papers related to 46 studies were included: 37 studies were, or used data from questionnaire surveys, 36 had quality scores of five or more out of 10, and 27 were about CAM. Available evidence suggests that \nusers of CAM and over-the-counter medicine are female, middle-aged, affluent and/or educated with some measure of poor health, and that people who use the private sector are affluent and/or educated. \nConclusion: People who engage in these activities are likely to be affluent. Targeted promotion may, therefore, be needed to ensure that use is equitable. People who use some activities also appear to have poorer measures of health than non-users or people attending conventional \nservices.

As technologies to design and manufacture diagnostic tests have developed, a range of self-tests have become available to the public to buy over-the-counter and via the Internet. This study aims to describe how many people have used self-tests and identify factors associated with their use. \n \nMethods \nA postal questionnaire will elicit basic information, including sociodemographic characteristics, and whether the person has used or would use specified self-tests. Consent will be sought to recontact people who want to participate further in the study, and interviews and focus groups will be used to develop hypotheses about factors associated with self-test use. These hypotheses will be tested in a case-control study. An in-depth questionnaire will be developed incorporating the identified factors. This will be sent to: people who have used a self-test (cases); people who have not used a self-test but would use one in the future (controls); and people who have not used and would not use a self-test (controls). Logistic regression analysis will be used to establish which factors are associated with self-test use. \n \nDiscussion \nSelf-tests do have potential benefits, for example privacy and convenience, but also potential harms, for example delay seeking treatment after a true negative result when the symptoms are actually due to another condition.

Two studies were carried out to assess content, criterion and construct validity, as well as internal consistency, of the Greek Coach-Athlete Relationship Questionnaire (GrCART-Q). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated the multidimensional nature of the Gr-CART-Q, which was underlined by the latent factors of Closeness, Commitment, and Complementarity. In addition, the predictive validity of the Gr-CART-Q was evidenced through the associations of the latent factors with the criterion variable of interpersonal satisfaction. This study was conducted in parallel with Jowett and Ntoumanis’ (2002) study so that the CART-Q was validated employing a sample of Greek and British coaches and athletes respectively. Taking both studies together, the generated findings reveal subtle differences; these differences are discussed in terms of the collectivism/individualism framework.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jowett, Sophia","Ntoumanis, Nikos"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, that experiment did not test strict alternation of the limbs but short alternate blocks of trials. We have therefore tested adaptation under alternate left/right hand movement with opposing rotations. It was clear that the left and right hand, within the alternating conditions, learnt to adapt to the opposing displacements at a similar rate suggesting that two adaptive states were formed concurrently. We suggest that the separate limbs are used as contextual cues to switch between the relevant adaptive states. However, we found that during online correction the alternating conditions had a significantly slower rate of adaptation in comparison to the unimanual conditions. Control conditions indicate that the results are not directly due the alternation between limbs or to the constant switching of vision between the two eyes. The negative interference may originate from the requirement to dissociate the visual information of these two alternating displacements to allow online control of the two arms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Galea, J.

We hypothesised that subjects would exhibit predictive coordinative responses which would co-vary with the state of the moving arm. Our null hypothesis is that they develop a time-dependent template of forces appropriate to compensate for the imposed perturbation. Subjects were trained to make 500 ms duration reaching movements with their dominant right arm to a visual target. A force generated with a robotic arm that was proportional to the velocity of the moving arm and perpendicular to movement direction acted on their stationary left hand, either at the same time as the movement or delayed by 250 or 500 ms. Subjects rapidly learnt to minimise the final end-point error. In the delay conditions, the left hand moved in advance of the onset of the perturbing force. In test conditions with faster or slower movement of the right hand, the predictive actions of the left hand co-varied with movement speed.

Mutant POR causes congenital adrenal hyperplasia with combined glucocorticoid and sex steroid deficiency. P450 oxidoreductase deficiency (ORD) commonly presents neonatally, with disordered sex development in both sexes, skeletal malformations, and glucocorticoid deficiency. \r\n \r\nObjective: The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and biochemical characteristics of ORD during puberty. \r\n \r\nDesign: Clinical, biochemical, and genetic assessment of seven ORD patients (five females, two males) presenting during puberty was conducted. \r\n \r\nResults: Predominant findings in females were incomplete pubertal development (four of five) and large ovarian cysts (five of five) prone to spontaneous rupture, in some only resolving after combined treatment with estrogen/progestin, GnRH superagonists, and glucocorticoids. Pubertal development in the two boys was more mildly affected, with some spontaneous progression. Urinary steroid profiling revealed combined CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 deficiencies indicative of ORD in all patients; all but one failed to mount an appropriate cortisol response to ACTH stimulation indicative of adrenal insufficiency. Diagnosis of ORD was confirmed by direct sequencing, demonstrating disease-causing POR mutations. \r\n \r\nConclusion: Delayed and disordered puberty can be the first sign leading to a diagnosis of ORD. Appropriate testosterone production during puberty in affected boys but manifest primary hypogonadism in girls with ORD may indicate that testicular steroidogenesis is less dependent on POR than adrenal and ovarian steroidogenesis. Ovarian cysts in pubertal girls may be driven not only by high gonadotropins but possibly also by impaired CYP51A1-mediated production of meiosis-activating sterols due to mutant POR.","bibo:AuthorList":["Idkowiak, Jan","O\u0027Riordan, Stephen","Reisch, Nicole","Malunowicz, Ewa M","Collins, Felicity","Kerstens, Michiel N","Köhler, Birgit","Graul-Neumann, Luitgard Margarete","Szarras-Czapnik, Maria","Dattani, Mehul","Silink, Martin","Shackleton, Cedric H L","Maiter, Dominique","Krone, Nils","Arlt, Wiebke"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19034,"sim:weight":0.617605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19174,"sim:weight":0.489667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5796882,"sim:weight":0.405045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19059,"sim:weight":0.35542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19030,"sim:weight":0.352342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1097260,"sim:weight":0.351548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31003,"sim:weight":0.338668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5724875,"sim:weight":0.309273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76066,"sim:weight":0.299663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.276887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033228,"sim:weight":0.259958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":743838,"sim:weight":0.259344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1097193,"sim:weight":0.256974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.255843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033552,"sim:weight":0.251607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75436,"sim:weight":0.235218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.225722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.222881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75441,"sim:weight":0.222332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.21321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In a randomized, double-blind trial, faeces were collected from healthy volunteers, and from patients with active CD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome before and after treatment. The levels of F. prausnitzii DNA in faecal suspensions were determined by PCR. Treatment by an elemental diet was effective, resulting in decreases in both the Harvey and Bradshaw index (P\u003c0.001) and the concentrations of serum C-reactive protein (P\u003c0.05). The total levels of F. prausnitzii in faecal samples from CD patients at presentation were lower than those in the other groups both before and after the treatment.

It is therefore likely that these circuits contribute to non-motor cognitive functions, but this is still a controversial issue. One approach is to examine evidence from neuropsychiatric disorders of cerebellar involvement. In this review, we narrow this search to test whether there is evidence of motor dysfunction associated with neuropsychiatric disorders consistent with disruption of cerebellar motor function. While we do find such evidence, especially in autism, schizophrenia and dyslexia, we caution that the restricted set of motor symptoms does not suggest global cerebellar dysfunction. Moreover, these symptoms may also reflect involvement of other, extra-cerebellar circuits and detailed examination of specific sub groups of individuals within each disorder may help to relate such motor symptoms to cerebellar morphology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miall, R.

All the invisibility cloaks demonstrated thus far, however, have relied on nano- or micro-fabricated artificial composite materials with spatially varying electromagnetic properties, which limit the size of the cloaked region to a few wavelengths. Here, we report the first realization of a macroscopic volumetric invisibility cloak constructed from natural birefringent crystals. The cloak operates at visible frequencies and is capable of hiding, for a specific light polarization, three-dimensional objects of the scale of centimetres and millimetres. Our work opens avenues for future applications with macroscopic cloaking devices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chen, Xianzhong","Luo, Yu","Zhang, Jingjing","Jiang, Kyle","Pendry, John B","Zhang, Shuang"],"dc:date":"2011-02-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26743,"sim:weight":0.322178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268391,"sim:weight":0.299736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.293669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84924,"sim:weight":0.28736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268952,"sim:weight":0.272406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23197,"sim:weight":0.271509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76320,"sim:weight":0.270024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99111,"sim:weight":0.269384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44673,"sim:weight":0.26343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84861,"sim:weight":0.261039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99049,"sim:weight":0.258669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.25825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85917,"sim:weight":0.257825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109196,"sim:weight":0.254872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.248941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271192,"sim:weight":0.234714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271226,"sim:weight":0.234687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512823,"sim:weight":0.234411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100346,"sim:weight":0.23376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98959,"sim:weight":0.232641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The neurological background of ssMRPs is briefly reviewed. Averaged ssMRPs represent the development of a lateralized rhythmic potential, and the energy of the EEG signals at the finger tapping frequency can be used for single-trial ssMRP classification. The proposed ssMRP-based BCI approach is tested using the classic Fisher\u0027s linear discriminant classifier. Moreover, the influence of the current source density transform on the performance of BCI system is investigated. The averaged correct classification rates (CCRs) as well as averaged information transfer rates (ITRs) for different sliding time windows are reported. Reliable single-trial classification rates of 88%-100% accuracy are achievable at relatively high ITRs. Furthermore, we have been able to achieve CCRs of up to 93% in classification of the ssMRPs recorded during imagined rhythmic finger movements. The merit of this approach is in the application of rhythmic cues for BCI, the relatively simple recording setup, and straightforward computations that make the real-time implementations plausible.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miall, R.

This is due to disruption of electron transfer from mutant POR to microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes that play a key role in glucocorticoid and sex steroid synthesis. POR also transfers electrons to all major drugmetabolizing CYP enzymes, including CYP3A4 that inactivates glucocorticoid and oestrogens. However, whether ORD results in impairment of in vivo drug metabolism has never been studied. \n \nDesign:We studied an adult patient with ORD due to homozygous POR A287P, the most frequent POR mutation in Caucasians, and her clinically unaffected, heterozygous mother. The patient had received standard dose oestrogen replacement from 17 until 37 years of age when it was stopped after she developed breast cancer. \n \nMethods: Both subjects underwent in vivo cocktail phenotyping comprising the oral administration of caffeine, tolbutamide, omeprazole, dextromethorphan hydrobromide and midazolam to assess the five major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes. We also performed genotyping for variant CYP alleles known to affect drug metabolism. \n \nResults: Though CYP enzyme genotyping predicted normal or high enzymatic activities in both subjects, in vivo assessment showed subnormal activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the patient and of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 in her mother. \n \nConclusions: Our results provide in vivo evidence for an important role of POR in regulating drug metabolism and detoxification. In patients with ORD, in vivo assessment of drug-metabolizing activities with subsequent tailoring of drug therapy and steroid replacement should be considered.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tomalik-Scharte, D.","Maiter, D.","Kirchheiner, J.","Ivison, H.

It has also been shown that unimanual adaptation to opposing novel environments is possible if they are associated with different workspaces. The main aim of this study was to test if adaptation to opposing velocity dependent viscous forces with one arm could improve the initial performance of the other arm. The study also examined whether this interlimb transfer occurred across an extrinsic, spatial, coordinative system or an intrinsic, joint based, coordinative system. Subjects initially adapted to opposing viscous forces separated by target location. Our measure of performance was the correlation between the speed profiles of each movement within a force condition and an ‘average’ trajectory within null force conditions. Adaptation to the opposing forces was seen during initial acquisition with a significantly improved coefficient in epoch eight compared to epoch one. We then tested interlimb transfer from the dominant to non-dominant arm (D → ND) and vice-versa (ND → D) across either an extrinsic or intrinsic coordinative system. Interlimb transfer was only seen from the dominant to the non-dominant limb across an intrinsic coordinative system. These results support previous studies involving adaptation to a single dynamic force but also indicate that interlimb transfer of multiple opposing states is possible. This suggests that the information available at the level of representation allowing interlimb transfer can be more intricate than a general movement goal or a single perceived directional error.","bibo:AuthorList":["Galea, J.

Shortening this spacer to 17 base pairs increases P1 promoter activity and short-circuits GrlA dependent activation. Hence, at the P1 promoter, the action of GrlA resembles that of many MerR family transcription activators at their target promoters.","bibo:AuthorList":["Islam, Md. Shahidul","Bingle, Lewis E.

Like all other microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, CYP17A1 requires electron transfer from P450 oxidoreductase (POR). \r\n \r\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to analyze the clinical and biochemical phenotype in a 46,XY individual carrying concomitant POR and AR mutations and to dissect their impact on phenotypic expression. \r\n \r\nMETHODS: We characterized the clinical and biochemical phenotype, genetic identification, and functional analysis of POR missense mutation by yeast micrososomal coexpression assays for CYP17A1, CYP21A2 and CYP19A1 activities. \r\n \r\nRESULTS: The patient presented neonatally with 46,XY DSD and was diagnosed as partial androgen insensitivity syndrome carrying a disease causing AR mutation (p.Q798E). She was raised as a girl and gonadectomized at the age of 4 yr. At 9 yr progressive clitoral enlargement prompted reassessment. Urinary steroid analysis was indicative of POR deficiency, but surprisingly androgen production was normal. Genetic analysis identified compound heterozygous POR mutations (p.601fsX12/p.Y607C). In vitro analysis confirmed p.Y607C as a pathogenic mutation with differential inhibition of steroidogenic CYP enzymes. \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION: Both mutant AR and POR are likely to contribute to the neonatal presentation with 46,XY DSD. Virilization at the time of adrenarche appears to suggest an age-dependent, diminishing disruptive effect of both mutant proteins. This case further highlights the importance to assess both gonadal and adrenal function in patients with 46,XY DSD.","bibo:AuthorList":["Idkowiak, Jan","Malunowicz, Ewa M","Dhir, Vivek","Reisch, Nicole","Szarras-Czapnik, Maria","Holmes, Donna M","Shackleton, Cedric H L","Davies, John D","Hughes, Ieuan A","Krone, Nils","Arlt, Wiebke"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19023,"sim:weight":0.617605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76066,"sim:weight":0.399605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19174,"sim:weight":0.385485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19030,"sim:weight":0.370195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31003,"sim:weight":0.347942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5724875,"sim:weight":0.299303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.232072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.22547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19059,"sim:weight":0.225045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033552,"sim:weight":0.2101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26719,"sim:weight":0.194387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.193544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99109,"sim:weight":0.189923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.188461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.188155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99402,"sim:weight":0.18252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23815,"sim:weight":0.175978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386803,"sim:weight":0.174844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46324,"sim:weight":0.171266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.166649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Conversely, the depletion of endogenous \nNBR1 enhances RTK degradation. Analyses of truncation mutations demonstrated that the C terminus of \nNbr1 is essential but not sufficient for this activity. Moreover, the C terminus of Nbr1 is essential but not \nsufficient for the localization of the protein to late endosomes. We demonstrate that the C terminus of Nbr1 \ncontains a novel membrane-interacting amphipathic -helix, which is essential for the late endocytic localization \nof the protein but not for its effect on RTK degradation. Finally, autophagic and late endocytic \nlocalizations of Nbr1 are independent of one another, suggesting that the roles of Nbr1 in each context might \nbe distinct.

In education we’re encouraged to use Virtual Learning Environments, as if somehow these spaces are not as real as classrooms; we participate (or read about others participating) in virtual worlds such as Second Life or World of Warcraft, places that imitate the real world, providing access to fantasies that are underpinned by very real economics; and we exploit the World Wide Web, believing in its textual metaphors (pages, hypertext) while ignoring its presence as a medium. In my contribution to this forum I want to suggest that our insistence on the immateriality of digital culture enforces an ontological distinction that overdetermines the materiality of the world beyond the monitor while misrecognizing the new things that are displayed upon it. Rather than continue to use the virtual as a category, I would like to argue using an alternative term, the apparition.1 Unlike the virtual, which foregrounds its effect of the real with reality itself present only as absence, apparition has two meanings: the first is an immaterial appearance, a ghostly presence that, like the virtual, can signal an absent materiality; the second is simply the appearance of something, specifically the emergence of something into history.

(Ross, 65-85; Barton, 80) Like the learned professions, men of science were entrusted with the production and possession of knowledge on behalf of the wider community and the label “man of science” signalled the sacrifice that justified the retention of this knowledge as private property. To be a man of science was to occupy the privileged position of speaking on behalf of the natural world, but the attribution of such a position depended upon the disinterestedness of those who held it. As David Vincent argues, guilds and trade societies were “stigmatized because their knowledge was uncodified, untestable, and protected for sectional gain rather than public benefit” whereas “the closures characteristic of the professions were held to be necessary for the maintenance of progressive standards of service from which everybody would ultimately gain.” (23) The term “man of science” expressed the disinterestedness that validated scientific discoveries for the scientific community and affirmed their right to possess such knowledge on behalf of nineteenth-century society. Although inclusive in terms of social position – it expressed an identification with a discipline rather than a formal system of training and qualification – it was a term that explicitly offered masculinity as a prerequisite for the disinterested pursuit of knowledge.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mussell, James"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44678,"sim:weight":0.533272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312612,"sim:weight":0.494382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.4602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.448975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.448864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44084,"sim:weight":0.441831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383665,"sim:weight":0.434191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383584,"sim:weight":0.430294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4415,"sim:weight":0.429829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.409675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383589,"sim:weight":0.409456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44647,"sim:weight":0.396629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47160,"sim:weight":0.39185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45867,"sim:weight":0.384726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48392,"sim:weight":0.371473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46818,"sim:weight":0.364639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46587,"sim:weight":0.363682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382030,"sim:weight":0.354441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352178,"sim:weight":0.328954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46611,"sim:weight":0.310898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Focusing on the popular scientific monthly Knowledge, this paper explores the evidentiary status of reproductions of astronomical photographs. After succeeding its founder Richard Anthony Proctor in 1889, the new editor of Knowledge, Arthur Cowper Ranyard, introduced high-quality collotype reproductions into each number of the magazine. One of Ranyard\u0027s main interests was the structure of the Milky Way, evidence for which was only available through astronomical photographs. As Ranyard reproduced photographs in support of his arguments, he blurred the boundaries between the published collotype, the source negative and the astronomical phenomena themselves. Since each of these carried different evidentiary value, the confusion as to what, exactly, was under discussion did not go unremarked. While eminent astronomers disputed both Ranyard\u0027s arguments and the way in which they were presented, Knowledge disseminated both striking astronomical images and also a broader debate over how they should be interpreted.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mussell, James"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382026,"sim:weight":0.464011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794283,"sim:weight":0.456881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.45456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382007,"sim:weight":0.450741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.44922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.425608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48393,"sim:weight":0.424235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44643,"sim:weight":0.421715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4415,"sim:weight":0.419452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108361,"sim:weight":0.417892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108601,"sim:weight":0.40804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.402284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48277,"sim:weight":0.401606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382037,"sim:weight":0.401432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382030,"sim:weight":0.383834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44804,"sim:weight":0.379783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112506,"sim:weight":0.374696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108863,"sim:weight":0.370175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108780,"sim:weight":0.364558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108340,"sim:weight":0.362564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is an important question, because if such attitudes are very likely to be converted into subsequent revealed actions then the early attitudes provide a sound basis for planning and intervention. This short paper queries the scientific accuracy of claims made in a previous paper by Croll (2010) based on a re-analysis of the British Household Panel Survey. It shows that even if the expressed intentions of young people to stay on in education post-16 were actually unrelated to their subsequent participation, the figures used by Croll would still display a substantial overlap between the two. This is because both reported intentions to stay on and subsequent participation are heavily imbalanced in favour of staying on. If this imbalance is taken into account then Croll’s conclusions, that early intentions are accurate and useful, fall to the ground.

Such labels might be helpful in structuring our understanding of phenomena. But they can also inhibit our activities when they serve as inaccurate or limiting descriptors. Based on the observation that mixed methods is fast becoming a common research approach in the social sciences, this paper questions whether the assumptions that are used and perpetuated by mixed methods are valid. The paper calls for a critical change in how we perceive research, in order to better describe actual research processes. A more ethological taxonomy of the mechanisms underlying research structures and processes is posited to encourage creative thinking around alternatives to the three purported paradigms of quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods. This ‘return to basics’ seeks to encourage new and innovative research designs to emerge, and suggests a rebirth of research from the ashes of mixed methods.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gorard, Stephen","Symonds, J"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.444691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.44433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.420403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.420403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.420403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.420403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.420403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.420403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.420403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.420403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.420403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.420403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.420403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.420403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.420403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.420403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.419262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.418211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.398151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.393868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A new piece of commercial software, claimed on the basis of publisher testing to be effective in improving reading after just six weeks of use in the classroom, was compared over ten weeks (one term) with standard practice in literacy provision. Pupil literacy was assessed before and after the trial, via another piece of commercial software testing precisely the kinds of skills covered by the pedagogical software. Both the treatment group and the comparison group improved their tested literacy. In a sense the publisher’s claim was justified. However, the comparison group improved their literacy scores considerably more than the treatment group, with a standardized improvement of +0.99 compared to +0.56 (overall ‘effect’ size of -0.37), suggesting that the software approach yields no relative advantage for improvements, and may even disadvantage some pupils. \r\nOn this evidence, the use of software, of a kind that is in very common use across schools in England, was a waste of resource. This could be an important corrective finding for an area of schooling that has been the focus of intense policy and practice attention. Of course, the software used has now been superseded by the same and different publishers. But the paper discusses the implications of these results for the use of such software to teach literacy more widely, for the way in which publisher claims are worded, and for the research community in relation to the feasibility of conducting pragmatic trials in school settings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Khan, M","Gorard, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.561453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.553907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50117,"sim:weight":0.531692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.528348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.500055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98688,"sim:weight":0.479841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.465508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.421859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56576,"sim:weight":0.420042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.393686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684257,"sim:weight":0.39338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.386787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49910,"sim:weight":0.333017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43722,"sim:weight":0.32185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19206,"sim:weight":0.270281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45828,"sim:weight":0.269605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46829,"sim:weight":0.268676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46124,"sim:weight":0.236643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43936,"sim:weight":0.198465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26696,"sim:weight":0.198272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, he will argue that in order to assess whether school systems are equitable we need to pay attention to the lived experience of pupils in schools, and that concerns about equality and quality in education need not be in tension with one another. Professor Gorard’s argument is that the use of school improvement models has led to an undue emphasis on the most visible indicators of schooling - examination results – which may marginalise other purposes and benefits of schooling. Social, ethnic and economic segregation between schools matters, but not primarily for the sake of test results because, for pupils, schools are their life and not merely a preparation for it. In general the lessons from international studies are that the mix of pupils between schools whether in terms of occupational class, income or sex has little impact on attainment. So policy makers can feel free to use criteria other than effectiveness for deciding on the pattern of intakes to schools including criteria related to equity\u0027","bibo:AuthorList":["Gorard, Stephen","Arthur, James","Davies, Ian","Hahn, C"],"dc:date":"2008-07-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101496,"sim:weight":0.632731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.628115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19203,"sim:weight":0.612345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50117,"sim:weight":0.595855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.592841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.534112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46829,"sim:weight":0.484125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2851,"sim:weight":0.482886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43722,"sim:weight":0.46819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.448879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19206,"sim:weight":0.439007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383349,"sim:weight":0.431555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49910,"sim:weight":0.420841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5127,"sim:weight":0.413671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48401,"sim:weight":0.38334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43909,"sim:weight":0.370236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.35873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19208,"sim:weight":0.316273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19211,"sim:weight":0.30769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45828,"sim:weight":0.300256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One way of marshalling evidence on a topic, or to answer a research question, is to use the findings of others as published in the literature. This use of evidence at third-hand is common – in the notorious literature review for a PhD, for example. I say ‘third-hand’ because the analyst does not have access to the primary evidence, nor are they re-presenting an analysis of the data. They are presenting a summary of what a previous author presented about an analysis of data. Done well, with a clear focus, such a review of literature can be useful, at least in establishing what others think, how a topic is usually researched, and why the topic might be important to research further. Some of the inherent weaknesses of using the accounts of others might be overcome by ensuring that all of the relevant literature was used, even accounts of unsuccessful studies and evidence from unpublished studies, and then conducting a full meta-analysis of the results (I recommend using a Bayesian approach, see appendix to Gorard et al. 2004, which allows the relatively simple combination of different kinds of evidence). But such systematic reviews of evidence are rare, very difficult to do properly, and both expensive and time-consuming. And anyway this second approach does not overcome the chief drawbacks of the literature which are that we have no direct access to the evidence of others, and often face a very partial view of the assumptions made and the analyses conducted.\u0027","bibo:AuthorList":["Gorard, Stephen","Thomson, Pat","Walker, Melanie"],"dc:date":"2010-03-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19203,"sim:weight":0.770868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19208,"sim:weight":0.60293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19051,"sim:weight":0.484633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.481047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19173,"sim:weight":0.462502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98457,"sim:weight":0.453228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.44798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.446962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48401,"sim:weight":0.4439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101388,"sim:weight":0.443136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.437351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.435696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271227,"sim:weight":0.433612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.405548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.398464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383611,"sim:weight":0.351213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.34494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929827,"sim:weight":0.322215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19206,"sim:weight":0.288412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.280623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In my own field of education research, perhaps the most discussed element of education lies in test scores. Examination results are measurements, the number of students attaining a particular standard in a test is a measurement; indeed the standard of a test is a measurement. The allocation of places at school, college or university, student:teacher ratios, funding plans, school timetables, staff workloads, adult participation rates, and the stratification of educational outcomes by sex, social class, ethnicity or geography for example, are all based on measurements. Good and careful work has been done in all of these areas (Nuttall 1987). However, the concept of measurement itself remains under-examined, and is often treated in an uncritical way. In saying this I mean more than the usual lament about qualitative:quantitative schism or the supposed reluctance of social scientists to engage with numeric analysis (Gorard et al. 2004a). I mean that even where numeric analysis is being conducted, the emphasis is on collecting, collating, analysing, and reporting the kinds of data generated by measurement, with the process of measurement and the rigor of the measurement instrument being somewhat taken for granted by many commentators. Issues that are traditionally considered by social scientists include levels of measurement, reliability, validity, and the creation of complex indices (as illustrated in some of the chapters contained in this volume). But these matters are too often dealt with primarily as technical matters – such as how to assess reliability or which statistical test to use with which combination of levels of measurement.

Cell-to-cell transmission is relatively resistant to anti-HCV glycoprotein monoclonal anti- bodies and polyclonal immunoglobulin isolated from infected individuals, providing an effective strategy for escaping host humoral immune responses. Chimeric viruses expressing the structural proteins rep- resenting the seven major HCV genotypes demonstrate neutralizing antibody-resistant cell-to-cell trans- mission. HCV entry is a multistep process involving numerous receptors. In this study we demonstrate that, in contrast to earlier reports, CD81 and the tight-junction components claudin-1 and occludin are all essential for both cell-free and cell-to-cell viral transmission. However, scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) has a more prominent role in cell-to-cell transmission of the virus, with SR-BI-specific antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors showing preferential inhibition of this infection route. These observations highlight the importance of targeting host cell receptors, in particular SR-BI, to control viral infection and spread in the liver.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brimacombe, Claire L","Grove, Joe","Meredith, Luke W","Hu, Ke","Syder, Andrew J","Flores, Maria Victoria","Timpe, Jennifer M","Krieger, Sophie E","Baumert, Thomas","Tellinghuisen, Timothy L","Wong-Staal, Flossie","Balfe, Peter","McKeating, Jane A"],"dc:date":"2011-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77078,"sim:weight":0.681887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19082,"sim:weight":0.66842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780070,"sim:weight":0.661918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19078,"sim:weight":0.634711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19071,"sim:weight":0.605155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19070,"sim:weight":0.592783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19079,"sim:weight":0.576353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77275,"sim:weight":0.569368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19073,"sim:weight":0.563209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19068,"sim:weight":0.555308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631131,"sim:weight":0.539506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19072,"sim:weight":0.531447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19083,"sim:weight":0.516672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631654,"sim:weight":0.51462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19081,"sim:weight":0.500542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19066,"sim:weight":0.492598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19074,"sim:weight":0.488678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19076,"sim:weight":0.46606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19080,"sim:weight":0.459638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19077,"sim:weight":0.455393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Objective: Our objective was to establish the health status of adults with CAH. Design and Setting: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study of adults with CAH attending specialized endocrine centers across the United Kingdom. Patients: Participants included 203 CAH patients (199 with 21-hydroxylase deficiency): 138 women, 65 men, median age 34 (range 18-69) years. Main Outcome Measures: Anthropometric, metabolic, and subjective health status was evaluated. Anthropometric measurements were compared with Health Survey for England data, and psychometric data were compared with appropriate reference cohorts. Results: Glucocorticoid treatment consisted of hydrocortisone (26%), prednisolone (43%), dexamethasone (19%), or a combination (10%), with reverse circadian administration in 41% of patients. Control of androgens was highly variable with a normal serum androstenedione found in only 36% of patients, whereas 38% had suppressed levels suggesting glucocorticoid overtreatment. In comparison with Health Survey for England participants, CAH patients were significantly shorter and had a higher body mass index, and women with classic CAH had increased diastolic blood pressure. Metabolic abnormalities were common, including obesity (41%), hypercholesterolemia (46%), insulin resistance (29%), osteopenia (40%), and osteoporosis (7%). Subjective health status was significantly impaired and fertility compromised. Conclusions: Currently, a minority of adult United Kingdom CAH patients appear to be under endocrine specialist care. In the patients studied, glucocorticoid replacement was generally nonphysiological, and androgen levels were poorly controlled.

To bridge this gap in knowledge, we synthesized the existing epidemiologic evidence on the relation between occupational exposure to benzene and the risk of leukemia, including all types combined and the four main subgroups acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). \n \nMethods \nA systematic literature review was carried out using two databases \u0027Medline\u0027 and \u0027Embase\u0027 from 1950 through to July 2009. We selected articles which provided information that can be used to estimate the relation between benzene exposure and cancer risk (effect size). \n \nResults \nIn total 15 studies were identified in the search, providing 16 effect estimates for the main analysis. The summary effect size for any leukemia from the fixed-effects model was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.23-1.57), but the study-specific estimates were strongly heterogeneous (I2 \u003d 56.5%, Q stat \u003d 34.47, p \u003d 0.003). The random-effects model yielded a summary- effect size estimate of 1.72 (95% CI, 1.37-2.17). Effect estimates from 9 studies were based on cumulative exposures. In these studies the risk of leukemia increased with a dose-response pattern with a summary-effect estimate of 1.64 (95% CI, 1.13-2.39) for low (\u003c 40 ppm-years), 1.90 (95% CI, 1.26-2.89) for medium (40-99.9 ppm-years), and 2.62 (95% CI, 1.57-4.39) for high exposure category (\u003e 100 ppm-years). In a meta-regression, the trend was statistically significant (P \u003d 0.015). Use of cumulative exposure eliminated heterogeneity. The risk of AML also increased from low (1.94, 95% CI, 0.95-3.95), medium (2.32, 95% CI, 0.91-5.94) to high exposure category (3.20, 95% CI, 1.09-9.45), but the trend was not statistically significant. \n \nConclusions \nOur study provides consistent evidence that exposure to benzene at work increases the risk of leukemia with a dose-response pattern. There was some evidence of an increased risk of AML and CLL. The meta-analysis indicated a lack of association between benzene exposure and the risk of CML.","bibo:AuthorList":["Khalade, Abdul","Jaakkola, Maritta S","Pukkala, Eero","Jaakkola, Jouni JK"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.284276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.275582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.263131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.256291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.246951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.244893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.227676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.222393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.221955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.220845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.218862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.218862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.216189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105299,"sim:weight":0.212777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98355,"sim:weight":0.206373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.199033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25871,"sim:weight":0.189921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.185922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.168502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.151104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is argued that far from providing the epistemic security promised by grounded theory, these notions—embodied in continuing reinventions of grounded theory—constrain and distort qualitative inquiry, and that what is contrived is not in fact theory in any meaningful sense, that ‘ground’ is a misnomer when talking about interpretation and that what ultimately materializes following grounded theory procedures is less like discovery and more akin to invention. The procedures admittedly provide signposts for qualitative inquirers, but educational researchers should be wary, for the significance of interpretation, narrative and reflection can be undermined in the procedures of grounded theory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thomas, Gary","James, David"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930163,"sim:weight":0.506265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.494039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43493,"sim:weight":0.479177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352134,"sim:weight":0.477402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383927,"sim:weight":0.474966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.471349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.468154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.459285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46636,"sim:weight":0.457451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386225,"sim:weight":0.454289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.451582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.447534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108223,"sim:weight":0.446972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.441201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43177,"sim:weight":0.439037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.438741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.43561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.434022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.430764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.426219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper explores which user groups access online corporate sustainability information, and assesses the relative use of sustainability reports and other forms of social and environmental information disseminated on corporate Websites. To collect the necessary empirical data, the paper analyses 4,652,471 successful requests for information made by the users of 10 UK FTSE 350 corporate websites. \n \nThe paper finds that the majority of requests for online sustainability information originate from the reporting company indicative of an inward focus to sustainability reporting. In examining access to different online information sets, distinct profiles of corporate Website users begin to emerge. Requests from employees, private individuals, ISPs and consultants represent the vast majority of the online sustainability reporting audience and the corporate website in general. Contrastingly, a professional financially-orientated profile of users characterised by professional investors, creditors, accounting firms and lawyers make significantly more use of the Annual Report but significantly less use of sustainability reporting information and other online disclosures. Although prior literature notes how companies have yet to utilise the potential of the online medium in disseminating corporate sustainability information, disclosures are found to attract approximately a tenth of all corporate website requests. Environmental and ethical disclosures outside the Annual Report are the most popular sources of online corporate sustainability information whilst ‘standalone’ Sustainability and/or Ethics Reports attract comparatively few requests.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rowbottom, Nicholas","Lymer, Andew"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1391638,"sim:weight":0.336697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103310,"sim:weight":0.314394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47250,"sim:weight":0.310217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106860,"sim:weight":0.295067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":684858,"sim:weight":0.290572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48416,"sim:weight":0.263118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":685115,"sim:weight":0.256516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394551,"sim:weight":0.22328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269870,"sim:weight":0.190703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387243,"sim:weight":0.186352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87821,"sim:weight":0.17795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18916,"sim:weight":0.174001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382033,"sim:weight":0.163395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.148077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101518,"sim:weight":0.144461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98465,"sim:weight":0.132203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.131175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48369,"sim:weight":0.12508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3170,"sim:weight":0.124775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.12274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the culture supernatant of cells producing HCV retroviral pseudotypes, the majority of E2 was not associated with infectious particles and failed to sediment on sucrose gradients. The E2 that was incorporated into infectious particles appeared as a triplet of diffuse bands at 60, 70, and 90 kDa. Similarly, three major forms of E1 were incorporated into the pseudotype particles, migrating at 33, 31, and 25 kDa. Endoglycosidase H (endo-H) treatment of particles demonstrated that the incorporated E1 was partially or completely sensitive to digestion. In contrast, the majority of the incorporated E2 was endo-H resistant. Purified pseudotype particles were found to contain both disulfide-linked aggregates and nonaggregated E1 and E2. HCV pseudotypes generated from cells expressing E1E2p7 showed similar heterogeneity in the incorporated glycoproteins and were of comparable infectivity to those generated by expression of E1E2. Our results demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of E1 and E2 incorporated into retroviral pseudotypes and highlight the difficulty in identifying forms of the HCV glycoproteins that initiate infection.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flint, Mike","Logvinoff, Carine","Rice, Charles M","McKeating, Jane A"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631131,"sim:weight":0.639798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19068,"sim:weight":0.452492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19080,"sim:weight":0.442779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19078,"sim:weight":0.439045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19070,"sim:weight":0.434803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19066,"sim:weight":0.430494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19079,"sim:weight":0.418972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19058,"sim:weight":0.389137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19071,"sim:weight":0.365254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19073,"sim:weight":0.360408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19067,"sim:weight":0.353062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19082,"sim:weight":0.345769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19077,"sim:weight":0.342614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19072,"sim:weight":0.332844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19084,"sim:weight":0.306066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19074,"sim:weight":0.303006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19075,"sim:weight":0.288566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.28002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19081,"sim:weight":0.271911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25909,"sim:weight":0.268914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In seven acutely infected health care workers, only two developed a nAb response that failed to associate with viral clearance. In contrast, the majority of chronically infected patients had nAbs. To determine the kinetics of strain-specific and crossreactive nAb emergence, we studied patient H, the source of the prototype genotype 1a H77 HCV strain. An early weak nAb response, specific for the autologous virus, was detected at seroconversion. However, neutralization of heterologous viruses was detected only between 33 and 111 weeks of infection. We also examined the development of nAbs in 10 chimpanzees infected with H77 clonal virus. No nAb responses were detected in three animals that cleared virus, whereas strain-specific nAbs were detected in six of the seven chronically infected animals after approximately 50 weeks of infection. The delayed appearance of high titer crossreactive nAbs in chronically infected patients suggests that selective mechanism(s) may operate to prevent the appearance of these Abs during acute infection. The long-term persistence of these nAbs in chronically infected patients may regulate viral replication.","bibo:AuthorList":["Logvinoff, Carine","Major, M E","Oldach, D","Heyward, S","Talal, A","Balfe, Peter","Feinstone, S M","Alter, H","Rice, C M","McKeating, Jane A"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631131,"sim:weight":0.535982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19068,"sim:weight":0.535117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19076,"sim:weight":0.52948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19070,"sim:weight":0.516158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19058,"sim:weight":0.492598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77078,"sim:weight":0.48016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19078,"sim:weight":0.430682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19065,"sim:weight":0.430494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19073,"sim:weight":0.413266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19079,"sim:weight":0.411795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19067,"sim:weight":0.382045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19077,"sim:weight":0.372604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19080,"sim:weight":0.371132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19071,"sim:weight":0.357445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19075,"sim:weight":0.333463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19082,"sim:weight":0.332366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.328325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19074,"sim:weight":0.315765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19072,"sim:weight":0.305305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19081,"sim:weight":0.29926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this study, we used cell culture-produced infectious HCV to analyze the viral entry pathway into Huh-7.5 cells. Bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A, inhibitors of vacuolar ATPases, prevented HCV entry when they were present prior to infection and had minimal effect on downstream replication events. HCV entry therefore appears to be pH dependent, requiring an acidified intracellular compartment. For many other enveloped viruses, acidic pH triggers an irreversible conformational change, which promotes virion-endosomal membrane fusion. Such viruses are often inactivated by low pH. In the case of HCV, exposure of virions to acidic pH followed by return to neutral pH did not affect their infectivity. This parallels the observation made for the related pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus. Low pH could activate the entry of cell surface-bound HCV but only after prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C. This suggests that there are rate-limiting, postbinding events that are needed to render HCV competent for low-pH-triggered entry. Such events may involve interaction with a cellular coreceptor or other factors but do not require cathepsins B and L, late endosomal proteases that activate Ebola virus and reovirus for entry.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tscherne, Donna M","Jones, Christopher T","Evans, Matthew J","Lindenbach, Brett D","McKeating, Jane A","Rice, Charles M"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8780070,"sim:weight":0.691503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77078,"sim:weight":0.685335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19070,"sim:weight":0.623223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19076,"sim:weight":0.586588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19073,"sim:weight":0.561364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19058,"sim:weight":0.555308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19082,"sim:weight":0.551563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19079,"sim:weight":0.540259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631131,"sim:weight":0.538767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19066,"sim:weight":0.535117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19071,"sim:weight":0.520519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19067,"sim:weight":0.5129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19077,"sim:weight":0.504624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631954,"sim:weight":0.503896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77275,"sim:weight":0.492936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19074,"sim:weight":0.49172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19078,"sim:weight":0.480999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19065,"sim:weight":0.452492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19081,"sim:weight":0.438128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19075,"sim:weight":0.435499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To investigate whether the CD81 sequence is a determinant of HCV host range, we expressed a panel of diverse CD81 proteins and tested their ability to interact with HCV. CD81 large extracellular loop (LEL) sequences were expressed as recombinant proteins; the human and, to a low level, the African green monkey sequences bound soluble HCV E2 (sE2) and inhibited infection by retrovirus pseudotype particles bearing HCV glycoproteins (HCVpp). In contrast, mouse or rat CD81 proteins failed to bind sE2 or to inhibit HCVpp infection. However, CD81 proteins from all species, when expressed in HepG2 cells, conferred susceptibility to infection by HCVpp and cell culture-grown HCV to various levels, with the rat sequence being the least efficient. Recombinant human CD81 LEL inhibited HCVpp infectivity only if present during the virus-cell incubation, consistent with a role for CD81 after virus attachment. Amino acid changes that abrogate sE2 binding (I182F, N184Y, and F186S, alone or in combination) were introduced into human CD81. All three amino acid changes in human CD81 resulted in a molecule that still supported HCVpp infection, albeit with reduced efficiency. In summary, there is a remarkable plasticity in the range of CD81 sequences that can support HCV entry, suggesting that CD81 polymorphism may contribute to, but alone does not define, the HCV susceptibility of a species. In addition, the capacity to support viral entry is only partially reflected by assays measuring sE2 interaction with recombinant or full-length CD81 proteins.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flint, Mike","von Hahn, Thomas","Zhang, Jie","Farquhar, Michelle","Jones, Christopher T","Balfe, Peter","Rice, Charles M","McKeating, Jane A"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631654,"sim:weight":0.827065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19083,"sim:weight":0.676017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19078,"sim:weight":0.658246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631131,"sim:weight":0.607684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19071,"sim:weight":0.596937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19073,"sim:weight":0.581154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19070,"sim:weight":0.524786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19080,"sim:weight":0.498188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19082,"sim:weight":0.490477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19081,"sim:weight":0.472436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19079,"sim:weight":0.453715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780070,"sim:weight":0.451191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19058,"sim:weight":0.44497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77078,"sim:weight":0.444669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77275,"sim:weight":0.401796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19074,"sim:weight":0.367583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19075,"sim:weight":0.362954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19067,"sim:weight":0.348828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19077,"sim:weight":0.333335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19068,"sim:weight":0.307894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Persistent in vitro infection was characterized by the selection of viral variants that displayed accelerated expansion kinetics, higher peak titers, and increased buoyant densities. Sequencing analysis revealed the selection of a single adaptive mutation in the HCV E2 envelope protein that was largely responsible for the variant phenotype. In parallel, as the virus became more aggressive, cells that were resistant to infection emerged, displaying escape mechanisms operative at the level of viral entry, HCV RNA replication, or both.

Scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) and CD81 are important entry factors for HCV internalization into target cells. The SR-BI gene gives rise to at least two mRNA splice variants, SR-BI and SR-BII, which differ in their C termini. SR-BI internalization remains poorly understood, but SR-BII is reported to endocytose via a clathrin-dependent pathway, making it an attractive target for HCV internalization. We demonstrate that HCV soluble E2 can interact with human SR-BI and SR-BII. Increased expression of SR-BI and SR-BII in the Huh-7.5 hepatoma cell line enhanced HCV strain J6/JFH and JFH infectivity, suggesting that endogenous levels of these receptors limit infection. Elevated expression of SR-BI, but not SR-BII, increased the rate of J6/JFH infection, which may reflect altered intracellular trafficking of the splice variants. In human plasma, HCV particles have been reported to be complexed with lipoproteins, suggesting an indirect interaction of the virus with SR-BI and other lipoprotein receptors. Plasma from J6/JFH-infected uPA-SCID mice transplanted with human hepatocytes demonstrates an increased infectivity for SR-BI/II-overexpressing Huh-7.5 cells.

Three host cell molecules have been reported to be important entry factors or receptors for HCV internalization: scavenger receptor BI, the tetraspanin CD81, and the tight junction protein claudin-1 (CLDN1). None of the receptors are uniquely expressed within the liver, leading us to hypothesize that their organization within hepatocytes may explain receptor activity. Since CD81 and CLDN1 act as coreceptors during late stages in the entry process, we investigated their association in a variety of cell lines and human liver tissue. Imaging techniques that take advantage of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to study protein-protein interactions have been developed.

To identify immunological correlates for this apparent protection, we studied HCV-specific immune responses in long-term IDUs (duration, \u003e10 years). METHODS: HCV-specific T cell responses were assessed in proliferation, enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), interferon (IFN)-gamma secretion, and cytotoxicity assays, whereas HCV-specific antibodies were assessed in enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), chemiluminescent assays, and in vitro neutralization assays. RESULTS: HCV-specific T cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production were more common in nonviremic EIA-positive IDUs (16 [94%] of 17 IDUs) than in viremic EIA-positive IDUs (9 [45%] of 20 IDUs) (P\u003d .003). They were also noted in 16 (62%) of 26 nonviremic EIA-negative IDUs. In contrast, 19 (90%) of 21 viremic IDUs displayed neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), compared with 9 (56%) of 16 nonviremic EIA-positive IDUs (P\u003d .04) and 0 of 24 nonviremic EIA-negative IDUs. Nonviremic IDUs with nAbs were older (P\u003d .0115) than those without nAbs, but these groups did not differ in terms of either injection drug use duration or HCV-specific T cell responses. CONCLUSION: The reduced risk of HCV persistence in IDUs previously recovered from HCV infection correlated with T cell responses, and prolonged antigenic stimulation appears to be required to maintain humoral responses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mizukoshi, Eishiro","Eisenbach, Christoph","Edlin, Brian R","Newton, Kimberly P","Raghuraman, Sukanya","Weiler-Normann, Christina","Tobler, Leslie H","Busch, Michael P","Carrington, Mary","McKeating, Jane A","O\u0027Brien, Thomas R","Rehermann, Barbara"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":55380,"sim:weight":0.641901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19068,"sim:weight":0.586588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19066,"sim:weight":0.52948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19070,"sim:weight":0.52681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19058,"sim:weight":0.46606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19067,"sim:weight":0.404573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.400597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19073,"sim:weight":0.353375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19082,"sim:weight":0.334267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19077,"sim:weight":0.33402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19072,"sim:weight":0.32092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19078,"sim:weight":0.316625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19080,"sim:weight":0.266748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25909,"sim:weight":0.25547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19069,"sim:weight":0.201494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.186627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26480,"sim:weight":0.176028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98615,"sim:weight":0.159884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.158886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.150027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We demonstrate a role for protein kinase A (PKA) in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle. The inhibition of PKA with H89, cyclic AMP (cAMP) antagonists, or the protein kinase inhibitor peptide reduced HCV entry into Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer methodology allowed us to investigate the PKA isoform specificity of the cAMP antagonists in Huh-7.5 cells, suggesting a role for PKA type II in HCV internalization. Since viral entry is dependent on the host cell expression of CD81, scavenger receptor BI, and claudin-1 (CLDN1), we studied the role of PKA in regulating viral receptor localization by confocal imaging and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis. Inhibiting PKA activity in Huh-7.5 cells induced a reorganization of CLDN1 from the plasma membrane to an intracellular vesicular location(s) and disrupted FRET between CLDN1 and CD81, demonstrating the importance of CLDN1 expression at the plasma membrane for viral receptor activity. Inhibiting PKA activity in Huh-7.5 cells reduced the infectivity of extracellular virus without modulating the level of cell-free HCV RNA, suggesting that particle secretion was not affected but that specific infectivity was reduced. Viral particles released from H89-treated cells displayed the same range of buoyant densities as did those from control cells, suggesting that viral protein association with lipoproteins is not regulated by PKA.

The mechanism of how these molecules coordinate HCV entry is unknown. In this study we demonstrate that a cell culture-adapted JFH-1 mutant, with an amino acid change in E2 at position 451 (G451R), has a reduced dependency on SR-BI. This altered receptor dependency is accompanied by an increased sensitivity to neutralization by soluble CD81 and enhanced binding of recombinant E2 to cell surface-expressed and soluble CD81. Fractionation of HCV by density gradient centrifugation allows the analysis of particle-lipoprotein associations. The cell culture-adapted mutation alters the relationship between particle density and infectivity, with the peak infectivity occurring at higher density than the parental virus. No association was observed between particle density and SR-BI or CD81 coreceptor dependence. JFH-1 G451R is highly sensitive to neutralization by gp-specific antibodies, suggesting increased epitope exposure at the virion surface. Finally, an association was observed between JFH-1 particle density and sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), suggesting that lipoprotein association reduces the sensitivity of particles to NAbs. In summary, mutation of E2 at position 451 alters the relationship between particle density and infectivity, disrupts coreceptor dependence, and increases virion sensitivity to receptor mimics and NAbs. Our data suggest that a balanced interplay between HCV particles, lipoprotein components, and viral receptors allows the evasion of host immune responses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Grove, Joe","Nielsen, Søren","Zhong, Jin","Bassendine, Margaret F","Drummer, Heidi E","Balfe, Peter","McKeating, Jane A"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19082,"sim:weight":0.767148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19071,"sim:weight":0.740625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19072,"sim:weight":0.666299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77078,"sim:weight":0.664825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19069,"sim:weight":0.658246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77275,"sim:weight":0.655811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19073,"sim:weight":0.654379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631131,"sim:weight":0.643275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19058,"sim:weight":0.634711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19079,"sim:weight":0.633294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19070,"sim:weight":0.632027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780070,"sim:weight":0.610524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631654,"sim:weight":0.600044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19077,"sim:weight":0.554824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19083,"sim:weight":0.549545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19080,"sim:weight":0.511857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19081,"sim:weight":0.49877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19068,"sim:weight":0.480999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19074,"sim:weight":0.475869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19075,"sim:weight":0.461823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To elucidate possible mechanisms of virus escape from these antibodies, retrovirus particles pseudotyped with HCV glycoproteins (HCVpp) isolated from sequential samples collected over a 26-year period from a chronically infected patient, H, were used to characterize the neutralization potential and binding affinity of a panel of anti-HCV E2 human monoclonal antibodies (HMAbs). Moreover, AP33, a neutralizing murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) to a linear epitope in E2, was also tested against selected variants. The HMAbs used were previously shown to broadly neutralize HCV and to recognize a cluster of highly immunogenic overlapping epitopes, designated domain B, containing residues that are also critical for binding of viral E2 glycoprotein to CD81, a receptor essential for virus entry. Escape variants were observed at different time points with some of the HMAbs. Other HMAbs neutralized all variants except for the isolate 02.E10, obtained in 2002, which was also resistant to MAb AP33. The 02.E10 HCVpp that have reduced binding affinities for all antibodies and for CD81 also showed reduced infectivity. Comparison of the 02.E10 nucleotide sequence with that of the strain H-derived consensus variant, H77c, revealed the former to have two mutations in E2, S501N and V506A, located outside the known CD81 binding sites. Substitution A506V in 02.E10 HCVpp restored binding to CD81, but its antibody neutralization sensitivity was only partially restored. Double substitutions comprising N501S and A506V synergistically restored 02.E10 HCVpp infectivity. Other mutations that are not part of the antibody binding epitope in the context of N501S and A506V were able to completely restore neutralization sensitivity. These findings showed that some nonlinear overlapping epitopes are more essential than others for viral fitness and consequently are more invariant during earlier years of chronic infection. Further, the ability of the 02.E10 consensus variant to escape neutralization by the tested antibodies could be a new mechanism of virus escape from immune containment. Mutations that are outside receptor binding sites resulted in structural changes leading to complete escape from domain B neutralizing antibodies, while simultaneously compromising viral fitness by reducing binding to CD81.","bibo:AuthorList":["Keck, Zhen-yong","Li, Sophia H","Xia, Jinming","von Hahn, Thomas","Balfe, Peter","McKeating, Jane A","Witteveldt, Jeroen","Patel, Arvind H","Alter, Harvey","Rice, Charles M","Foung, Steven K H"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":81309,"sim:weight":0.561628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19078,"sim:weight":0.511857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19071,"sim:weight":0.502089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19070,"sim:weight":0.500881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19069,"sim:weight":0.498188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631131,"sim:weight":0.490137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19058,"sim:weight":0.459638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19065,"sim:weight":0.442779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19073,"sim:weight":0.440579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19079,"sim:weight":0.406969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77275,"sim:weight":0.378749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19082,"sim:weight":0.37635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19066,"sim:weight":0.371132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631129,"sim:weight":0.364678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19077,"sim:weight":0.353326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101519,"sim:weight":0.347919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19074,"sim:weight":0.330523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19068,"sim:weight":0.327992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19072,"sim:weight":0.318264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930889,"sim:weight":0.313946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

HepG2 cells develop polarity over time, resulting in the formation and remodeling of bile canalicular (BC) structures. HepG2 cells expressing CD81 provide a model system to study the effects of hepatic polarity on HCV infection. We found an inverse association between HepG2-CD81 polarization and HCV pseudoparticle entry. As HepG2 cells polarize, discrete pools of claudin-1 (CLDN1) at the TJ and basal/lateral membranes develop, consistent with the pattern of receptor staining observed in liver tissue. The TJ and nonjunctional pools of CLDN1 show an altered association with CD81 and localization in response to the PKA antagonist Rp-8-Br-cyclic AMPs (cAMPs). Rp-8-Br-cAMPs reduced CLDN1 expression at the basal membrane and inhibited HCV infection, supporting a model where the nonjunctional pools of CLDN1 have a role in HCV entry. Treatment of HepG2 cells with proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha and gamma interferon, perturbed TJ integrity but had minimal effect(s) on cellular polarity and HCV infection, suggesting that TJ integrity does not limit HCV entry into polarized HepG2 cells. In contrast, activation of PKC with phorbol ester reduced TJ integrity, ablated HepG2 polarity, and stimulated HCV entry.

CLDN1 overexpression in subconfluent cells was unable to recapitulate this effect, whereas increased SR-BI expression enhanced HCVpp entry and HCVcc internalization, demonstrating a rate-limiting role for SR-BI in HCV internalization.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schwarz, Anne K","Grove, Joe","Hu, Ke","Mee, Christopher J","Balfe, Peter","McKeating, Jane A"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77078,"sim:weight":0.789848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19078,"sim:weight":0.767148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19071,"sim:weight":0.72246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780070,"sim:weight":0.699889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19072,"sim:weight":0.6887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19058,"sim:weight":0.66842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19073,"sim:weight":0.653971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19070,"sim:weight":0.650434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19079,"sim:weight":0.639108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77275,"sim:weight":0.62639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19077,"sim:weight":0.606409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19081,"sim:weight":0.571127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19074,"sim:weight":0.560549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19068,"sim:weight":0.551563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19075,"sim:weight":0.542663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631131,"sim:weight":0.518956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631654,"sim:weight":0.513855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19083,"sim:weight":0.505847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19069,"sim:weight":0.490477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19067,"sim:weight":0.445237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) enters cells via a multistep process involving tetraspanin CD81, scavenger receptor class B member I, and the tight junction proteins Claudin-1 and Occludin. CD81 and scavenger receptor class B member I interact with HCV-encoded glycoproteins, suggesting an initial role in mediating virus attachment. In contrast, there are minimal data supporting Claudin-1 association with HCV particles, raising questions as to its role in the virus internalization process. In the present study we demonstrate a relationship between receptor active Claudins and their association and organization with CD81 at the plasma membrane by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and stoichiometric imaging methodologies. Mutation of residues 32 and 48 in the Claudin-1 first extracellular loop ablates CD81 association and HCV receptor activity. Furthermore, mutation of the same residues in the receptor-inactive Claudin-7 molecule enabled CD81 complex formation and virus entry, demonstrating an essential role for Claudin-CD81 complexes in HCV infection. Importantly, Claudin-1 associated with CD81 at the basolateral membrane of polarized HepG2 cells, whereas tight junction-associated pools of Claudin-1 demonstrated a minimal association with CD81. In summary, we demonstrate an essential role for Claudin-CD81 complexes in HCV infection and their localization at the basolateral surface of polarized hepatoma cells, consistent with virus entry into the liver via the sinusoidal blood and association with basal expressed forms of the receptors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harris, Helen J","Davis, Christopher","Mullins, Jonathan G L","Hu, Ke","Goodall, Margaret","Farquhar, Michelle J","Mee, Christopher J","McCaffrey, Kitty","Young, Stephen","Drummer, Heidi","Balfe, Peter","McKeating, Jane A"],"dc:date":"2010-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631954,"sim:weight":0.716412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19069,"sim:weight":0.676017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19081,"sim:weight":0.645132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19071,"sim:weight":0.588417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19078,"sim:weight":0.549545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780070,"sim:weight":0.547074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631131,"sim:weight":0.546548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19058,"sim:weight":0.516672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77078,"sim:weight":0.506303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19082,"sim:weight":0.505847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19074,"sim:weight":0.49788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19079,"sim:weight":0.496116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19075,"sim:weight":0.469538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77275,"sim:weight":0.434301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19070,"sim:weight":0.42456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631799,"sim:weight":0.392768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19077,"sim:weight":0.379533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19073,"sim:weight":0.34896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19068,"sim:weight":0.340921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19072,"sim:weight":0.30423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The use of dominant negative constructs, specific inhibitory drugs and RNAi to selectively prevent entry through particular pathways has provided evidence for the clathrin-mediated entry of hepatitis C virus (HCV) as well as the caveolar entry of Simian Virus 40. Moreover, the ability to image and track fluorescent-labelled virus particles in real-time has begun to challenge the classical plasma membrane entry mechanisms described for poliovirus and human immunodeficiency virus. This review will cover both well-documented entry mechanisms as well as more recent discoveries in the entry pathways of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. This will include viruses which enter the cytosol directly at the plasma membrane and those which enter via endocytosis and traversal of internal membrane barrier(s). Recent developments in imaging and inhibition of entry pathways have provided insights into the ill-defined entry mechanism of HCV, bringing it to the forefront of viral entry research. Finally, as high-affinity receptors often define viral internalisation pathways, and tropism in vivo, host membrane proteins to which viral particles specifically bind will be discussed throughout.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thorley, Jennifer A","McKeating, Jane A","Rappoport, Joshua Zachary"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19079,"sim:weight":0.492972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46970,"sim:weight":0.4203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19068,"sim:weight":0.413211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19070,"sim:weight":0.402801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.397644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19082,"sim:weight":0.384525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19071,"sim:weight":0.382736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19058,"sim:weight":0.375372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19072,"sim:weight":0.347873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631654,"sim:weight":0.347695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19078,"sim:weight":0.331938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23032,"sim:weight":0.322475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19074,"sim:weight":0.318405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.313937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.308197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19065,"sim:weight":0.306066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384092,"sim:weight":0.304093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98959,"sim:weight":0.301387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49071,"sim:weight":0.298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19077,"sim:weight":0.297925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The majority of these systems use the Chalk aquifer as a water source. A significant proportion of the abstracted water must be returned to the aquifer to maintain groundwater levels. If the ground system is to function correctly, the temperature of the abstracted groundwater must not be altered significantly by early thermal breakthrough of the returned water. Groundwater flow within the Chalk is predominantly through fractures and these provide the primary route by which thermal breakthrough might take place. The nature of the fracturing and its impact on the thermal transport beneath a proposed site must be understood to provide confidence that the ground energy system will function correctly. Two tracer and thermal test methods to determine fracture properties are examined. The results suggest that the flow in the Chalk is carried by a small number of fractures and that careful modelling and interpretation can provide valuable constraints on the frequency of fractures, their spatial pattern and their hydraulic aperture. The results highlight difficulties for designing within borehole temperature monitoring systems for fractured aquifer thermal experiments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Law, R.","Mackay, R."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53448,"sim:weight":0.581712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57747,"sim:weight":0.557662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53881,"sim:weight":0.55197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62681,"sim:weight":0.497265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76223,"sim:weight":0.46382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53951,"sim:weight":0.411632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62728,"sim:weight":0.386042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62687,"sim:weight":0.382185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17994,"sim:weight":0.377731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62769,"sim:weight":0.365848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59964,"sim:weight":0.364573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99069,"sim:weight":0.341014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62785,"sim:weight":0.328828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.312764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.312763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55151,"sim:weight":0.307093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57571,"sim:weight":0.305235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60643,"sim:weight":0.298804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61637,"sim:weight":0.29795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62729,"sim:weight":0.29772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, there has been little investigation of the number of trials needed to obtain stable and reliable estimates of performance. Both tests have potential limitations in reflecting the underlying construct of cervical proprioception and association between performances in both has not been investigated previously. \r\n \r\nMETHODS: Head repositioning and head-tracking errors were measured using an electromagnetic-tracking system in 16 normal subjects, tested on 3 occasions over 2 days. The effect of different numbers of trial repeats was analyzed descriptively in terms of stability of measures obtained and by using intraclass correlation coefficients to assess reliability. Association between the tests was analyzed with the Pearson correlation coefficient. \r\n \r\nRESULTS: Stable estimates of performance were obtained when data from 6 or more trials was included. The greatest test-retest reliability was obtained with 5 or more trials in both the cervical JPE (intraclass correlation coefficients \u003d 0.73-0.84) and cervicocephalic kinesthesia (intraclass correlation coefficients \u003d 0.90-0.97) tests. Correlation analyses indicated no significant association between performances in the 2 tests (r \u003d -0.476-0.228, P \u003e 0.05). \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION: Our finding that at least 6 trials were needed to optimize stability, and reliability of outcome measures has important implications for application of these tests. The lack of correlation between performances in the tests supports the suggestion that they are not comparable measures of cervical proprioception. Further planned studies will include a range of tests challenging different aspects of cervical proprioceptive contribution to sensorimotor control in different subcategories of neck pain patients.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miall, R.

In so doing, it is argued that the origins of its plan are to be found in the works of the early to mid-thirteenth century, and that the tower itself was probably begun during the 1260s. Furthermore, it is asserted that the tower represents a milestone in the thinking that underpinned the redevelopment of castle mottes, and that it is to be seen as the prime connection between the circle-based plans that dominated motte redevelopments in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and later developments that led, ultimately, to the radically different, but architecturally successful scheme adopted by the builder of the donjon of Warkworth Castle in Northumberland. \n \nRésumé \nLa grande tour du château de Dudley, dans la région de West Midlands, est réexaminée dans le but de la situer dans la séquence évolutionnaire des grands modèles de tours.

Conflicts of criminal jurisdiction","bibo:abstract":"The expansion of claims of extended territorial and extraterritorial criminal legislative jurisdiction and the increasing facility with which States are able to obtain custody over defendants by way of more effective extradition arrangements is leading to a new problem in transnational criminal law. The result of these developments is that more than one State may have legitimate jurisdiction to legislate for the same conduct and the courts of more than one State may be entitled to exercise judicial jurisdiction over those persons charged with crimes arising from that conduct. For prosecutors, the problem may present itself as one of prosecutorial efficiency—how may the case be proceeded with expeditiously, in particular, in which jurisdiction is a conviction most likely to be secured? Considerations such as the availability of witnesses or the admissibility of evidence may influence the prospects of conviction and prospective punishments may be a factor when deciding in which system prosecutors prefer the case to go ahead. Defendants have different perspectives. In many cases involving extradition to face a charge based on an exercise of extended jurisdiction, the defendant will be removed from the place where he lives and works to another State. There may be adverse consequences for him compared to facing a trial where he is usually located. Criminal proceedings abroad will be in an unfamiliar legal system; bail may be harder to obtain because of a perceived greater danger of flight; the impossibility to continue working during the period in which the trial is being prepared may impose financial hardship; defendants will be removed from their families and social networks for considerable periods.","bibo:AuthorList":["Warbrick, Colin","Brookson-Morris, Kate"],"dc:date":"2007-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99223,"sim:weight":0.488147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929884,"sim:weight":0.483138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387378,"sim:weight":0.470542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98725,"sim:weight":0.454376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269950,"sim:weight":0.441978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26474,"sim:weight":0.427173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99064,"sim:weight":0.42507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.401645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387410,"sim:weight":0.400714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98910,"sim:weight":0.397567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99396,"sim:weight":0.396814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47601,"sim:weight":0.395051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99235,"sim:weight":0.394798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381989,"sim:weight":0.391951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45050,"sim:weight":0.382985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99091,"sim:weight":0.372053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45534,"sim:weight":0.367961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.356097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99355,"sim:weight":0.350983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96261,"sim:weight":0.345676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This article examines how Islamic, Byzantine, Carolingian and Palestinian Christian attitudes toward representation were expressed, and differed, across the seventh and eighth centuries. Islamic prohibitions against representing human figures were not universally recognised, but were particularly – if sometimes erratically – focused on mosque decoration. Byzantine ‘iconoclasm’ – more properly called iconomachy – was far less destructive than its later offshoots in France and England, and resulted in a highly nuanced re-definition of what representation meant in the Orthodox church. Carolingian attitudes toward images were on the whole far less passionate than either Islamic or Orthodox views, but certain members of the elite had strong views, which resulted in particular visual expressions. Palestinian Christians, living under Islamic rule, modulated their attitudes toward images to conform with local social beliefs. Particularly in areas under Orthodox or Islamic control, then, representation mattered greatly around the year 800, and this article examines how and why this impacted on local production.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brubaker, Leslie"],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":90566,"sim:weight":0.41521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.405357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.387825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17841,"sim:weight":0.360462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382030,"sim:weight":0.347279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46774,"sim:weight":0.346411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383600,"sim:weight":0.345105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46981,"sim:weight":0.336795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46823,"sim:weight":0.331943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45918,"sim:weight":0.314326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352178,"sim:weight":0.282027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385386,"sim:weight":0.262785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43451,"sim:weight":0.16526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43652,"sim:weight":0.15918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43608,"sim:weight":0.152971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43669,"sim:weight":0.151641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43825,"sim:weight":0.14801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43705,"sim:weight":0.145674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43701,"sim:weight":0.137157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43693,"sim:weight":0.1334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

But, in spite of persistent reports of widespread human rights violations in Africa, there is no evidence that state parties make use of this procedure to report each other to the African Commission for violations of the provisions of the Charter. State parties are generally not keen to complain about human right violations by another state of its own nationals within its territory. The reason for this reluctance may lie in the well-known adage that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones. However, if the decision in the recent Nigerian case of Gunme \u0026 Ors v. Attorney General of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is good law and is followed in other countries, then an important way by which to overcome this reluctance on the part of state parties may have been established. In that case the Federal High Court of Nigeria in Abuja allowed 12 Cameroonians, who alleged that their right to self-determination under the African Charter had been violated by the Republic of Cameroon, to maintain an action in Nigeria for an order requiring Nigeria, as a state party to the African Charter, to present the case of the peoples of Southern Cameroons for self-determination and independence before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).","bibo:AuthorList":["Enonchong, Nelson"],"dc:date":"2002-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44495,"sim:weight":0.476449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99208,"sim:weight":0.469676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47601,"sim:weight":0.468513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99128,"sim:weight":0.424906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99396,"sim:weight":0.416309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98910,"sim:weight":0.407139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98917,"sim:weight":0.403568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99156,"sim:weight":0.395177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352199,"sim:weight":0.393171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99332,"sim:weight":0.391986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381889,"sim:weight":0.380301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381989,"sim:weight":0.371969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387410,"sim:weight":0.355144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930217,"sim:weight":0.354846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387122,"sim:weight":0.353527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99009,"sim:weight":0.349922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18142,"sim:weight":0.349646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98951,"sim:weight":0.349177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99223,"sim:weight":0.348889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384310,"sim:weight":0.348527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

But how do we explain the fact that there is one concept of law when there are different conceptions of law with a variety of different features? Finnis, inspired by the Aristotelian notion of central case, adumbrates the idea that the concept of law might be unified by a primary concept which is the concept of “law as practical reason”; that is, law conceived from an ethical perspective. He advances two arguments to defend his methodology: the conceptual and the functional. Contra Finnis, the paper shows that neither the conceptual nor the functional argument can successfully support the view that “law as practical reason” is the central case of the concept of law. The study clarifies the Aristotelian notion of central case and illustrates the mistaken application of this notion to the concept of law. However, we also argue that Finnis\u0027s insight–the idea that all the different conceptions of law might be unified for the purposes of theoretical research–is fundamental and appealing. This paper aims to reconstruct Finnis\u0027s insight through the model of core resemblance. The result is that the different conceptions of law can be unified by resemblance to the concept of “law as practical reason,” though there is no identity among the different conceptions of law.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rodriguez-Blanco, Veronica"],"dc:date":"2007-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98910,"sim:weight":0.504926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.404732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48320,"sim:weight":0.395125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44865,"sim:weight":0.363809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352134,"sim:weight":0.3385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47100,"sim:weight":0.322629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.318524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.314891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387345,"sim:weight":0.310616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386225,"sim:weight":0.302549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.301905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.291876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.285922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387215,"sim:weight":0.283428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.25852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46587,"sim:weight":0.253549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":617735,"sim:weight":0.247802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48301,"sim:weight":0.2404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45879,"sim:weight":0.218883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27048,"sim:weight":0.217911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We know that mere analysis of our legal concepts cannot tell us much about their properties, that is, about the empirical aspect of law. We have learned this from philosophical criticisms of conceptual analysis; yet Hart informs us that analytic jurisprudence can be reconciled with descriptive sociology. The answer to this puzzle lies in the notion of nonambitious conceptual analysis. The theorist analyzes concepts but accepts the limitations of conceptual analysis and therefore uses empirical knowledge and substantive arguments to explain, refine, or perhaps refute initial insights provided by intuitions. This is the conclusion that this paper arrives at as an argumentative strategy to defend Hart\u0027s legal theory from the criticisms of Stavropoulos and Dworkin. The latter argues that Hart\u0027s legal theory cannot explain theoretical disagreements in law because he relies on a shared criterial semantics. Stavropoulos aims to show that Hart\u0027s semantics is committed to ambitious conceptual analysis and relies on the usage of our words as a standard of correctness. Both attacks aim to show that the semantic sting stings Hart\u0027s legal theory. This essay refines both challenges and concludes that not even in the light of the most charitable interpretation of these criticisms is Hart\u0027s legal theory stung by the semantic sting. This study defends the view that Hart\u0027s methodological claims were modest and that he was aware of the limits of conceptual analysis as a philosophical method.

It made provision for the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u0027 Rights (the Commission), which was established in 1987. The purpose of the Commission, according to the Charter, is “to protect human and peoples\u0027 rights and ensure their protection in Africa”. But the Commission has not been able to discharge that office satisfactorily. An important reason for the inability of the Commission to attain its principal objective of protecting human rights in Africa is the fact that it has no power to grant a remedy. It has no jurisdiction to make binding decisions against state parties that have violated the provisions of the Charter.

Age and gender differences in \nathletes’ views regarding these psychological environments were also examined. \n \nDesign: Cross-sectional; participants responded to a number of questionnaires assessing peer and coach motivational climate, and affective and behavioural responses in youth sport. \n \nMethods: Participants were 493 young athletes, age 12–17 years (M ageZ14.08; SDZ1.29), from various individual and team sports. \n \nResults: Hierarchical regression analyses, controlling for age and gender, showed that a perceived task-involving \npeer MC was the only predictor of physical self-worth. A perceived ego-involving coach climate emerged as the only predictor of trait anxiety. Enjoyment was predicted positively by both coach and peer task-involving MCs, \nwhereas reported effort was predicted only by the coach task-involving MC. A 2-way MANOVA revealed that perceptions of ego-involving coach and peer MCs were higher among males, whereas females reported higher perceptions of task-involving coach and peer MCs, whereas no age differences were identified. A significant age–gender interaction effect on the peer ego-involving MC emerged. \n \nConclusions: The findings provide evidence for the importance of peer-created MC in youth sport and suggest that both coach and peer influence should be considered in future research on young athletes’ self perceptions and \nmotivation-related responses in sport.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vazou, Spiridoula","Ntoumanis, Nikos","Duda, Joan L"],"dc:date":"2006-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Vazou, N Ntoumanis and J L Duda.

As a subsidiary and exploratory question, we also examined whether these well-being components are \nmore strongly related to structured exercise participation scores compared to total levels of physical activity. \n \nDesign: Cross-sectional survey. Method: The participants were 312 employees from an information technology company (nZ204 males and nZ108 females). Structural equation modelling was used to examine links between exercise participation and the three well-being components within a hierarchical framework, featuring global well-being constructs at the apex and specific elements of well-being at lower levels. \n \nResults: Support was found for the a priori model in that there were direct paths from exercise to physical self \nand enthusiasm at work. Furthermore, there were indirect paths between exercise and global well-being components through measures of the physical self and enthusiasm at work. The results of an alternative model using physical activity as opposed to exercise were generally similar. \n \nConclusion: The support found for the exercise and well-being model indicates that exercise is associated directly and indirectly with high well-being in various facets of employees’ lives. Thus, this study extends previous research that has examined associations between exercise and isolated indicators of employee well-being. Finally, the results pertaining to physical activity suggest that workplace exercise promotion programmes should \nincorporate and promote lifestyle physical activity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thøgersen-Ntoumani, Cecilie","Fox, Kenneth R","Ntoumanis, Nikos"],"dc:date":"2005-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":103625,"sim:weight":0.465341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43807,"sim:weight":0.417728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387053,"sim:weight":0.393277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18997,"sim:weight":0.314478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103148,"sim:weight":0.31011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386454,"sim:weight":0.308929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101178,"sim:weight":0.307319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48238,"sim:weight":0.285122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102909,"sim:weight":0.277709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99136,"sim:weight":0.275304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.270413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101625,"sim:weight":0.26898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26439,"sim:weight":0.259512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.254194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48329,"sim:weight":0.253413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.250006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.249329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106970,"sim:weight":0.241238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.225367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18046,"sim:weight":0.216413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Structural equation modeling analysis, using maximum likelihood robust method, showed athletes’ perceptions of autonomy support, mastery focus, and social support from the coach to predict their satisfaction of the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, respectively. The satisfaction of the need for competence emerged as the most important predictor of psychological and physical well-being. The findings suggest that particular aspects of the social environment may be salient for fostering particular psychological needs.

However, it is possible that the proprioceptive representation of the EOM extends to other brain sites, which were not examined in these previous studies. The aim of this fMRI study was to sample the whole brain to identify the proprioceptive representation for the left and the right eye separately. Data were acquired while passive eye movement was used to stimulate EOM proprioceptors in the absence of a motor command. We also controlled for the tactile stimulation of the eyelid by removing from the analysis voxels activated by eyelid touch alone. For either eye, the brain area commonly activated \nby passive and active eye movement was located bilaterally in the somatosensory area extending into the motor and premotor cytoarchitectonic areas.

Contemporary research conducted in the context of school physical education (PE) has increasingly embraced various tenets of selfdetermination theory (Deci \u0026 Ryan, 1985, 1991). Despite this increase in research attention, some postulates of the framework remain unexplored (e.g. impact of a need-supportive climate). As such, the present study sought to provide a more comprehensive test of self-determination theory. The present work also examined Deci and Ryan’s claim that the motivational sequence embraced by their framework is invariant across gender. \n \nAims. (i) To examine a model of motivation based on the tenets of selfdetermination theory, and (ii) explore the invariance of the model across gender. \n \nSample. Participants were 950 British secondary school students (443 male, 490 female, 17 gender not specified) \n \nMethod. Participants completed a questionnaire that included measures of need support, need satisfaction, motivation, positive and negative affect, task challenge, and concentration. \n \nResults. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis revealed that students who perceived a need-supporting environment experienced greater levels of need satisfaction. Need satisfaction predicted intrinsic motivation, which, in turn, linked to adaptive PE-related outcomes. In contrast, need satisfaction negatively predicted amotivation, which, in turn, was positively predictive of feelings of unhappiness. Multisample \nSEM invariance testing revealed the model to be largely invariant for male and female students. \n \nConclusions. The results of the study provide support for self-determination theory and corroborate the application of the framework to the context of school PE. Further, we largely found support for the invariance of the motivational processes embraced by self-determination theory across gender.","bibo:AuthorList":["Standage, Martyn","Duda, Joan L","Ntoumanis, Nikos"],"dc:date":"2005-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19115,"sim:weight":0.757464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19142,"sim:weight":0.696956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769338,"sim:weight":0.686972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19109,"sim:weight":0.623389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930580,"sim:weight":0.62217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19154,"sim:weight":0.614032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19151,"sim:weight":0.592448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387053,"sim:weight":0.591174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19168,"sim:weight":0.56417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19106,"sim:weight":0.536878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19140,"sim:weight":0.521744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18997,"sim:weight":0.516309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19152,"sim:weight":0.49041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19200,"sim:weight":0.481438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53691,"sim:weight":0.469427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19032,"sim:weight":0.438318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631528,"sim:weight":0.438028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18992,"sim:weight":0.435784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98621,"sim:weight":0.426336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18989,"sim:weight":0.422449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here, EC and dermal or synovial fibroblasts were cultured on opposite surfaces of 3-lm pore filters and incorporated in static or flow-based migration assays. Fibroblasts had little effect on tumour necrosis factor-a-induced transendothelial migration of neutrophils,but tended to increase the efficiency of migration away from the endothelium.Surprisingly, similar close contact between EC and fibroblasts strongly reduced lymphocyte migration in static assays, and nearly abolished stable lymphocyte adhesion from flow. Fibroblasts did not alter endothelial surface expression of adhesion molecules or messenger RNA for chemokines. Inhibition of attachment did not occur when EC-fibroblast contact was restricted by using 04-lm pore filters, but under these conditions pre-treatment with heparinase partially inhibited adhesion. In the 3-lm pore co-cultures, inhibition of metalloproteinase activity partially recovered lymphocyte adhesion, but addition of CXCL12 (SDF-1a) to the endothelial surface did not. Hence, the ability of EC to present activating chemokines for lymphocytes may have been enzymatically inhibited by direct contact with fibroblasts. To avoid contact, we cultured EC and fibroblasts on separate 3-lm pore filters one above the other. Here,fibroblasts promoted the transendothelial migration of lymphocytes. Fibroblasts generate CXCL12, but blockade of CXCL12 receptor had no effect on lymphocyte migration. While stromal cells can provide signal(s)promoting leucocyte migration away from the sub-endothelial space,direct cell contact (which might occur in damaged tissue) may cause disruption of chemokine signalling, specifically inhibiting lymphocyte rather than neutrophil recruitment.","bibo:AuthorList":["McGettrick, Helen M.","Buckley, Christopher D.","Filer, Andrew","Ed Rainger, G.","Nash, Gerard B."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75685,"sim:weight":0.532363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25866,"sim:weight":0.462477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76925,"sim:weight":0.379625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99391,"sim:weight":0.377813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50122,"sim:weight":0.331907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269992,"sim:weight":0.323363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.31697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98887,"sim:weight":0.274184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.260871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45418,"sim:weight":0.257274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.255753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.253173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929817,"sim:weight":0.252154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.250178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98986,"sim:weight":0.248252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99258,"sim:weight":0.244422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23977,"sim:weight":0.242855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26781,"sim:weight":0.242855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.240391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.237571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Preictal EEG changes occur in both human patients and animal models, but their underlying mechanisms and relationship with seizure initiation remain unknown. Here we demonstrate the existence, in the hippocampal CA1 region, of a preictal state characterized by the progressive and global increase in neuronal activity associated with a widespread buildup of low-amplitude high-frequency activity (HFA) (100 Hz) and reduction in system complexity.HFAis generated by the firing of neurons, mainly pyramidal cells, at much lower frequencies. Individual cycles ofHFAare generated by the near-synchronous (within 5 ms) firing of small numbers of pyramidal cells. The presence of HFA in the low-calcium model implicates nonsynaptic synchronization; the presence of very similar HFA in the high-potassium model shows that it does not depend on an absence of synaptic transmission. Immediately before seizure onset, CA1 is in a state of high sensitivity in which weak depolarizing or synchronizing perturbations can trigger seizures. Transition to seizure is haracterized by a rapid expansion and fusion of the neuronal populations responsible for HFA, associated with a progressive slowing of HFA, leading to a single, massive, hypersynchronous cluster generating the high-amplitude low-frequency activity of the seizure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jiruska, P.","Csicsvari, J.","Powell, A.

Two intact groups were assigned curricular interventions: the Sport Education \ngroup (n \u003d 25), which received eight 60-min lessons, and the comparison group (n \u003d 26), which received a traditional teaching approach to sportbased activity. Pre- and postintervention measures of student enjoyment, perceived \neffort, perceived competence, goal orientations, perceived motivational climate, and perceived autonomy were obtained for both groups. Repeated-measures ANOVAs showed significant increases in student enjoyment and perceived effort in the Sport Education group only. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that increases in task-involving climate and perceived autonomy explained a significant amount of unique variance in the Sport Education \nstudents’ postintervention enjoyment, perceived effort, and perceived competence responses. The results suggest that the Sport Education curriculum may increase perceptions of a task-involving climate and perceived autonomy, and in so doing, enhance the motivation of high school students toward \nphysical education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wallhead, Tristan L","Ntoumanis, Nikos"],"dc:date":"2004-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53691,"sim:weight":0.608155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19144,"sim:weight":0.545409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98621,"sim:weight":0.467197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.450252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19154,"sim:weight":0.449959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52534,"sim:weight":0.44067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.43863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387053,"sim:weight":0.433493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19103,"sim:weight":0.407621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.40673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98665,"sim:weight":0.386548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.380635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19165,"sim:weight":0.374098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19152,"sim:weight":0.367234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19140,"sim:weight":0.366608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.361772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.358766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930580,"sim:weight":0.357041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19120,"sim:weight":0.356852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85132,"sim:weight":0.348603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We placed pairs of participants in competition with each other to make a series of button presses. Within subject analysis of movement times revealed a 10 per cent benefit for reactive actions. This was maintained when opponents performed dissimilar actions, and when participants competed against a computer, suggesting that the effect is not related to facilitation produced by action observation. Rather, faster ballistic movements may be a general property of reactive motor control, potentially providing a useful means of promoting survival.","bibo:AuthorList":["Welchman, A.

{"identifier":19132,"ep:Repository":120,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Critical Role of FLRT1 Phosphorylation in the Interdependent Regulation of FLRT1 Function and FGF Receptor Signalling","bibo:abstract":"Background \n \nFibronectin leucine rich transmembrane (FLRT) proteins have dual properties as regulators of cell adhesion and potentiators of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) mediated signalling. The mechanism by which the latter is achieved is still unknown and is the subject of this investigation. \n \nPrincipal Findings \n \nHere we show that FLRT1 is a target for tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by FGFR1 and implicate a non-receptor Src family kinase (SFK). We identify the target tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of FLRT1 and show that these are not direct substrates for Src kinase suggesting that the SFK may exert effects via potentiation of FGFR1 kinase activity. We show that whilst FLRT1 expression results in a ligand-dependent elevation of MAP kinase activity, a mutant version of FLRT1, defective as an FGFR1 kinase substrate (Y3F-FLRT1), has the property of eliciting ligand-independent chronic activation of the MAP kinase pathway which is suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of either FGFR1 or Src kinase. Functional investigation of FGFR1 and FLRT1 signalling in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells reveals that FLRT1 alone acts to induce a multi-polar phenotype whereas the combination of FLRT1 and FGFR activation, or expression of Y3F-FLRT1, acts to induce neurite outgrowth via MAPK activation. Similar results were obtained in a dendrite outgrowth assay in primary hippocampal neurons. We also show that FGFR1, FLRT1 and activated Src are co-localized and this complex is trafficked toward the soma of the cell. The presence of Y3F-FLRT1 rather than FLRT1 resulted in prolonged localization of this complex within the neuritic arbour. \n \nConclusions \n \nThis study shows that the phosphorylation state of FLRT1, which is itself FGFR1 dependent, may play a critical role in the potentiation of FGFR1 signalling and may also depend on a SFK-dependent phosphorylation mechanism acting via the FGFR. This is consistent with an ‘in vivo’ role for FLRT1 regulation of FGF signalling via SFKs. Furthermore, the phosphorylation-dependent futile cycle mechanism controlling FGFR1 signalling is concurrently crucial for regulation of FLRT1-mediated neurite outgrowth.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wheldon, Lee M","Haines, Bryan P","Rajappa, Rajit","Mason, Ivor","Rigby, Peter W","Heath, John K","Neylon, Cameron"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19315,"sim:weight":0.435033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.298867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.258969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.258515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.243601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584827,"sim:weight":0.235823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.22243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.216871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45616,"sim:weight":0.205765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.191042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384092,"sim:weight":0.187083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.185164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44075,"sim:weight":0.178694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385429,"sim:weight":0.174523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99061,"sim:weight":0.172559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386803,"sim:weight":0.161025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381877,"sim:weight":0.145048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23818,"sim:weight":0.136911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931090,"sim:weight":0.081266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26655,"sim:weight":0.0749228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In mammalian cells, NMD is also linked to pre-mRNA splicing, usually PTCs trigger strong NMD only when positioned upstream of at least one intron. The exon junction complex (EJC) is believed to mediate the link between splicing and NMD in these systems. Here, we report that in Schizosaccharomyces pombe splicing also enhances NMD, but against the EJC model prediction, an intron stimulated NMD regardless of whether it is positioned upstream or downstream of the PTC and EJC components are not required. Still the effect of splicing seems to be direct—we have found that the important NMD determinant is the proximity of an intron to the PTC, not just the occurrence of splicing. On the basis of these results, we propose a new model to explain how splicing could affect NMD.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brogna, Saverjo","Wen, Jikai"],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77057,"sim:weight":0.742623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46581,"sim:weight":0.283851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.272398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46577,"sim:weight":0.247659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.222107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.207663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269995,"sim:weight":0.206754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45616,"sim:weight":0.204276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99353,"sim:weight":0.204089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.196378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99431,"sim:weight":0.194053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384092,"sim:weight":0.17954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.177621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98668,"sim:weight":0.174558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.15951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98501,"sim:weight":0.157923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.157898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98669,"sim:weight":0.1537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98866,"sim:weight":0.151427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98662,"sim:weight":0.143612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the role of lipid antigen binding in stabilization and quality control of CD1 heavy chain (HC).beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) complexes is unclear. Furthermore, the distinct trafficking and loading routes of CD1 proteins take them from mildly acidic pH in early endososmal compartments (pH 6.0) to markedly acidic pH in lysosomes (pH 5.0) and back to neutral pH of the cell surface (pH 7.4). Here, we present evidence that the stability of each CD1 HC.beta(2)m complex is determined by the distinct pH optima identical to that of the intracellular compartments in which each CD1 isoform resides. Although stable at acidic endosomal pH, complexes are only stable at cell surface pH 7.4 when bound to specific lipid antigens. The proposed model outlines a quality control program that allows lipid exchange at low endosomal pH without dissociation of the CD1 HC.beta(2)m complex and then stabilizes the antigen-loaded complex at neutral pH at the cell surface.","bibo:AuthorList":["Odyniec, A.

The remains are those of a woman, Irtyersenu, aged about 50, from the necropolis of Thebes and dated to about 600 BC. Augustus Bozzi Granville (1783–1872), an eminent physician and obstetrician, described many organs still in situ and attributed the cause of death to a tumour of the ovary. However, subsequent histological investigations indicate that the tumour is a benign cystadenoma. Histology of the lungs demonstrated a potentially fatal pulmonary exudate and earlier studies attempted to associate this with particular disease conditions. Palaeopathology and ancient DNA analyses show that tuberculosis was widespread in ancient Egypt, so a systematic search for tuberculosis was made, using specific DNA and lipid biomarker analyses. Clear evidence for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA was obtained in lung tissue and gall bladder samples, based on nested PCR of the IS6110 locus. Lung and femurs were positive for specific M. tuberculosis complex cell-wall mycolic acids, demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography of pyrenebutyric acid–pentafluorobenzyl mycolates.

This impaired T-cell production leads to weakened immune responses. Yet the molecular mechanisms of thymic stromal adipose involution are not clear. Age-related alterations also occur in the murine thymus providing an excellent model system. In the present work structural and molecular changes of the murine thymic stroma were investigated during aging. We show that thymic epithelial senescence correlates with significant destruction of epithelial network followed by adipose involution. We also show in purified thymic epithelial cells the age-related down-regulation of Wnt4 (and subsequently FoxN1), and the prominent increase in LAP2α expression. These senescence-related changes of gene expression are strikingly similar to those observed during mesenchymal to pre-adipocyte differentiation of fibroblast cells suggesting similar molecular background in epithelial cells. For molecular level proof-of-principle stable LAP2α and Wnt4-over-expressing thymic epithelial cell lines were established. LAP2α over-expression provoked a surge of PPARγ expression, a transcription factor expressed in pre-adipocytes. In contrast, additional Wnt4 decreased the mRNA level of ADRP, a target gene of PPARγ. Murine embryonic thymic lobes have also been transfected with LAP2α- or Wnt4-encoding lentiviral vectors. As expected LAP2α over-expression increased, while additional Wnt4 secretion suppressed PPARγ expression. Based on these pioneer experiments we propose that decreased Wnt activity and increased LAP2α expression provide the molecular basis during thymic senescence. We suggest that these molecular changes trigger thymic epithelial senescence accompanied by adipose involution. This process may either occur directly where epithelium can trans-differentiate into pre-adipocytes; or indirectly where first epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs followed by subsequent pre-adipocyte differentiation. The latter version fits better with literature data and is supported by the observed histological and molecular level changes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kvell, Krisztian","Varecza, Zoltan","Bartis, Domokos","Hesse, Sebastian","Parnell, Sonia","Anderson, Graham","Jenkinson, Eric J.","Pongracz, Judit E.","Hansen, Immo A."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77074,"sim:weight":0.532706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26476,"sim:weight":0.253831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.250431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.207129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.202975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.195886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269995,"sim:weight":0.190854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46577,"sim:weight":0.186822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.186169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.17413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99270,"sim:weight":0.167262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386803,"sim:weight":0.156394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.156188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98615,"sim:weight":0.153204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.151876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98529,"sim:weight":0.14381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384092,"sim:weight":0.137971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.135799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99459,"sim:weight":0.113996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931090,"sim:weight":0.11055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One hundred and seventy-eight students (69% male) aged between 11 and 16 years completed a multisection questionnaire at the beginning, middle, and end of a school trimester. Multilevel growth models revealed that students’ perceived competence and self-determined regulations were the most consistent predictors of the outcome variables at the within- and between-person levels.

Structural equation modeling analysis with a sample of 108 athletes revealed coach behaviors as predictors of goal motives, which in turn predicted psychological well-being after 8 weeks. Supplementary regression analyses showed no interaction between autonomous goal motives and implementation intentions; however, a synergistic effect was identified for controlled goal motives such that controlled motives furnished with implementation intentions resulted in lower well-being than controlled motives alone. In further analyses, the motives underlying an implementation intention were found to mediate the paths from goal motives to well-being.

Dart-throwing performance did not differ among the four goal conditions. Personal achievement goals did not moderate the effects of experimentally induced goals on selfhandicapping and performance. The extent to which mastery-avoidance goals are maladaptive is discussed, as well as the interplay between personal and experimentally induced goals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ntoumanis, Nikos","Thøgersen-Ntoumani, Cecilie","Smith, Alison"],"dc:date":"2009-09-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53691,"sim:weight":0.451657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19167,"sim:weight":0.437214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46902,"sim:weight":0.420098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19194,"sim:weight":0.391407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52534,"sim:weight":0.34972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98621,"sim:weight":0.343036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387053,"sim:weight":0.288789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.276764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.27586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98665,"sim:weight":0.275209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.264232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.252278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101625,"sim:weight":0.232625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.218113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177169,"sim:weight":0.216983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106970,"sim:weight":0.213434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.202817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.18824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19106,"sim:weight":0.14697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47240,"sim:weight":0.133152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Multilevel modeling analyses showed significant decreases in task-involving teacher climate, relatedness, identified regulation, and intrinsic motivation. In contrast, there were significant increases in ego-involving climate and amotivation. For some of these variables the observed linear decreases or increases were somewhat reversed by the beginning of the last year of the junior high school. No significant changes were observed in competence need satisfaction and in extrinsic and introjected regulations. We found substantial between-student variability in the intercepts and growth trajectories of most variables and, therefore, we tested a number of theoretical and demographic predictors to partly account for such variations.

The 13 exercise on prescription sites in Birmingham were randomised to current practice (n\u003d7) or to the SDT-based intervention (n\u003d6). \nOutcomes measured at 3 and 6-months: Minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity per week assessed using the 7-day Physical Activity Recall; physical health: blood pressure and weight; health status measured using the Dartmouth CO-OP charts; anxiety and depression measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and vitality measured by the subjective vitality score; motivation and processes of change: perceptions of autonomy support from the advisor, satisfaction of the needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness via physical activity, and motivational regulations for exercise. \nDiscussion \nThis trial will determine whether an exercise referral programme based on Self Determination Theory increases physical activity and other health outcomes compared to a standard programme and will test the underlying SDT-based process model (perceived autonomy support, need satisfaction, motivation regulations, outcomes) via structural equation modelling. \nTrial registration \nThe trial is registered as Current Controlled trials ISRCTN07682833.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jolly, Kate","Duda, Joan L","Daley, Amanda","Eves, Frank F","Mutrie, Nanette","Ntoumanis, Nikos","Rouse, Peter C.","Lodhia, Rekha","Williams, Geoffrey C"],"dc:date":"2009-06-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":387053,"sim:weight":0.527196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9023102,"sim:weight":0.525314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49216,"sim:weight":0.524458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.419783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57812,"sim:weight":0.356155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387164,"sim:weight":0.355792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.347143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338415,"sim:weight":0.336302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.313214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.309058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.309058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53278,"sim:weight":0.30892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.307456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23524,"sim:weight":0.294887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.293056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54744,"sim:weight":0.283577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338489,"sim:weight":0.272538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.251672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.247382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11157,"sim:weight":0.236738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Due to the importance of this period in the development of a child\u0027s character, the Learning for Life project has chosen to research the transition from primary to secondary school as part of its focus.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arthur, James","Davison, Jon","See, Beng Huat","Knowles, Catherine"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":50117,"sim:weight":0.79077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.644467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309510,"sim:weight":0.633903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19157,"sim:weight":0.601795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49910,"sim:weight":0.593628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335390,"sim:weight":0.569489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46984,"sim:weight":0.55466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46562,"sim:weight":0.463876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19156,"sim:weight":0.458855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":333874,"sim:weight":0.456689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.446135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269878,"sim:weight":0.44237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.421672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48401,"sim:weight":0.404967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47136,"sim:weight":0.401859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309193,"sim:weight":0.376245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19159,"sim:weight":0.367954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.360336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.357349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336380,"sim:weight":0.350414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The model posits that passion is a strong inclination toward an activity that individuals like (or even love), that they value, and in which they invest time and energy. Furthermore, two types of passion are proposed: harmonious and obsessive passion. While obsessive passion entails an uncontrollable urge to engage in the passionate activity, harmonious passion entails a sense of volition while engaging in the activity. Finally, the model posits that harmonious passion leads to more adaptive outcomes than obsessive passion. Three studies provided support for this dualistic conceptualization of passion. Study 1 showed that harmonious passion was positively associated with adaptive behaviours (e.g., celebrate the team’s victory), while obsessive passion was rather positively associated with maladaptive behaviours (e.g., to risk losing one’s employment to go to the team’s game). Study 2 used a short Passion Scale and showed that harmonious passion was positively related to the positive affective life of fans during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, psychological health (self-esteem and life satisfaction), and public displays of adaptive behaviours (e.g., celebrating one’s team victory in the streets), while obsessive passion was predictive of maladaptive affective life (e.g., hating opposing team’s fans) and behaviours (e.g., mocking the opposing team’s fans). Finally, Study 3 examined the role of obsessive passion as a predictor of partner’s conflict that in turn undermined partner’s relationship satisfaction. Overall, the present results provided support for the Dualistic Model of Passion. The conceptual and applied implications of the findings are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vallerand, Robert J.","Ntoumanis, Nikos","Philippe, Frederick L","Lavigne, Genevieve L","Carbonneau, Noemie","Bonneville, Arielle","Lagac-Labont, Camille","Maliha, Gabrielle"],"dc:date":"2008-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9540388,"sim:weight":0.77731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18013,"sim:weight":0.37257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101625,"sim:weight":0.26145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.258223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.257885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.251536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52534,"sim:weight":0.242292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388776,"sim:weight":0.242243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227493,"sim:weight":0.239914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.235158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.23396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53691,"sim:weight":0.231665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387053,"sim:weight":0.231168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.22907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.22907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.22907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.22907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.22907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.22907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.22907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Preictal EEG changes occur in both human patients and animal models, but their underlying mechanisms and relationship with seizure initiation remain unknown. Here we demonstrate the existence, in the hippocampal CA1 region, of a preictal state characterized by the progressive and global increase in neuronal activity associated with a widespread buildup of low-amplitude high-frequency activity (HFA) (greater than 100 Hz) and reduction in system complexity. HFA is generated by the firing of neurons, mainly pyramidal cells, at much lower frequencies. Individual cycles of HFAare generated by the near-synchronous (within approximately 5 ms) firing of small numbers of pyramidal cells. The presence of HFA in the low-calcium model implicates nonsynaptic synchronization; the presence of very similar HFA in the high-potassium model shows that it does not depend on an absence of synaptic transmission. Immediately before seizure onset, CA1 is in a state of high sensitivity in which weak depolarizing or synchronizing perturbations can trigger seizures. Transition to seizure is characterized by a rapid expansion and fusion of the neuronal populations responsible for HFA, associated with a progressive slowing of HFA, leading to a single, massive, hypersynchronous cluster generating the high-amplitude low-frequency activity of the seizure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jiruska, Premysl","Csicsvari, Josef","Powell, Andrew D","Fox, John E","Chang, Wei-Chih","Vreugdenhil, Martin","Li, Xiaoli","Palus, Milan","Bujan, Alejandro F","Dearden, Richard W","Jefferys, John G R"],"dc:date":"2010-04-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75717,"sim:weight":0.701748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9441538,"sim:weight":0.578994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25992,"sim:weight":0.459198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387160,"sim:weight":0.325662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113355,"sim:weight":0.319172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46533,"sim:weight":0.274049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":501129,"sim:weight":0.268469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107090,"sim:weight":0.264044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.252912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584828,"sim:weight":0.238419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387384,"sim:weight":0.236922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58984,"sim:weight":0.227921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58982,"sim:weight":0.210295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89280,"sim:weight":0.199531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98823,"sim:weight":0.198649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383175,"sim:weight":0.196856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58986,"sim:weight":0.178755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386404,"sim:weight":0.178426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.16965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46344,"sim:weight":0.166126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Fast ripples are highly specific for the seizure initiation zone. However, evidence for the association of fast ripples with epileptic foci depends on animal models and human cases with substantial lesions in the form of hippocampal sclerosis, which suggests that neuronal loss may be required for fast ripples. In the present work, we tested whether cell loss is a necessary prerequisite for the generation of fast ripples, using a non-lesional model of temporal lobe epilepsy that lacks hippocampal sclerosis. The model is induced by unilateral intrahippocampal injection of tetanus toxin. Recordings from the hippocampi of freely-moving epileptic rats revealed high-frequency activity (4100 Hz), including fast ripples. High-frequency activity was present both during interictal discharges and seizure onset. Interictal fast ripples proved a significantly more reliable marker of the primary epileptogenic zone than the presence of either interictal discharges or ripples (100–250 Hz). These results suggest that fast ripple activity should be considered for its potential value in the pre-surgical workup of non-lesional temporal lobe epilepsy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jiruska, Premysl","Finnerty, Gerald T","Powell, Andrew D","Lofti, Noosheen","Cmejla, Roman","Jefferys, John G R"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8826720,"sim:weight":0.578994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75717,"sim:weight":0.5454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387160,"sim:weight":0.401307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4885987,"sim:weight":0.279049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25992,"sim:weight":0.278779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":501129,"sim:weight":0.274182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107090,"sim:weight":0.272036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.267418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360880,"sim:weight":0.250613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":544689,"sim:weight":0.245331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":458151,"sim:weight":0.220068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387384,"sim:weight":0.210687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584828,"sim:weight":0.208224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709952,"sim:weight":0.195235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.194537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84783,"sim:weight":0.194404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268784,"sim:weight":0.193519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.192147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.189094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.188951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In addition, they reported a significant increase in competence and introjected regulation. Compared to the control condition, the SDTc reported a significantly greater linear increase in structure and interpersonal involvement,relatedness and competence need satisfaction and positive affect. Attendance rates were significantly higher in the SDTc. SDT-based social-contextual characteristics and psychological needs predicted autonomous regulations; all these variables collectively predicted adaptive outcomes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Edmunds, Jemma","Ntoumanis, Nikos","Duda, Joan L"],"dc:date":"2007-09-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19109,"sim:weight":0.794845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387053,"sim:weight":0.633374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19200,"sim:weight":0.49205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19108,"sim:weight":0.451638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53691,"sim:weight":0.43827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52534,"sim:weight":0.358045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19154,"sim:weight":0.335802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98621,"sim:weight":0.331963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98665,"sim:weight":0.327728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.30969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.309565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.309106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.307381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43807,"sim:weight":0.304244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.292729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.292729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.292729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.292729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.292729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.292729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Research in the sport and physical education literature has primarily focused on coaches’ autonomysupportive behaviours. Surprisingly, there has been very little research on the use of controlling strategies. A brief overview of the research which delineates each proposed strategy is presented, as are examples of the potential manifestation of the behaviours associated with each strategy in the context of sports coaching. In line with self-determination theory (Deci \u0026 Ryan, 1985; Ryan \u0026 Deci, 2002), we propose that coach behaviours employed to pressure or control athletes have the potential to thwart athletes’ feelings of autonomy, competence,and relatedness, which, in turn, undermine athletes’ self-determined motivation and contribute to the development of controlled motives. When athletes feel pressured to behave in a certain way, a variety of negative consequences are expected to ensue which are to the detriment of the athletes’ well-being. The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness and interest in the darker side of sport participation and to offer suggestions for future research in this area.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bartholomew, Kimberley","Ntoumanis, Nikos","Thøgersen-Ntoumani, Cecilie"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19127,"sim:weight":0.710955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631528,"sim:weight":0.701083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19103,"sim:weight":0.614966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53691,"sim:weight":0.603012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52534,"sim:weight":0.536924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19152,"sim:weight":0.468478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387053,"sim:weight":0.464543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19120,"sim:weight":0.459378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19118,"sim:weight":0.439223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":333353,"sim:weight":0.416349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18992,"sim:weight":0.413259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19128,"sim:weight":0.391175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19106,"sim:weight":0.385497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335301,"sim:weight":0.378097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":333967,"sim:weight":0.371243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50146,"sim:weight":0.36009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336130,"sim:weight":0.329457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":333284,"sim:weight":0.328511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98621,"sim:weight":0.325885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19109,"sim:weight":0.314013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Expression from this promoter is dependent on direct activation by the cyclic AMP receptor protein, which binds to a target centred 49.5 base pairs upstream from the transcript start. Activator-dependent transcription from the aer promoter was reconstituted in vitro, and a tethered inorganic nuclease was used to find the position of the C-terminal domains of the RNA polymerase α subunits in transcriptionally competent open complexes. We report that the ternary activator-RNA polymerase-aer promoter open complex is organized differently from complexes at previously characterized promoters. Among other E. coli promoters recognized by RNA polymerase containing σ28, only the trg promoter is activated directly by the cyclic AMP receptor protein. The organization of the different promoter elements and the activator binding site at the trg promoter is the same as at the aer promoter, suggesting a common activation mechanism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hollands, Kerry","Lee, David J.","Lloyd, Georgina S.","Busby, Stephen J.

Pupil-reported plans to continue in formal education and their aspirations for professional occupations are heavily stratified by individual and family background, including prior attainment. This is as expected. But once this variation has been accounted for, in a logistic regression model, there is both a small school mix ‘effect’ and a much larger school experience effect.

Cases of nonclassic 11OHD are rare compared with the incidence of nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency. \n \nObjective: The aim of the study was to analyze the functional consequences of seven novel CYP11B1 mutations (p.M88I, p.W116G, p.P159L, p.A165D, p.K254_A259del, p.R366C, p.T401A) found in three patients with classic 11OHD, two patients with nonclassic 11OHD, and three heterozygous carriers for CYP11B1 mutations. \n \nMethods: We conducted functional studies employing a COS7 cell in vitro expression system comparing wild-type (WT) and mutant CYP11B1 activity. Mutants were examined in a computational three-dimensional model of the CYP11B1 protein. \n \nResults: All mutations (p.W116G, p.A165D, p.K254_A259del) found in patients with classic 11OHD have absent or very little 11β-hydroxylase activity relative to WT. The mutations detected in patients with nonclassic 11OHD showed partial functional impairment, with one patient being homozygous (p.P159L; 25% of WT) and the other patient compound heterozygous for a novel mild p.M88I (40% of WT) and the known severe p.R383Q mutation. The two mutations detected in heterozygous carriers (p.R366C, p.T401A) also reduced CYP11B1 activity by 23 to 37%, respectively. \n \nConclusion: Functional analysis results allow for the classification of novel CYP11B1 mutations as causative for classic and nonclassic 11OHD, respectively.

The modification involves addition of a nitro group at the position ortho to the phenol group of tyrosine to give 3-nitrotyrosine. To understand the mechanisms and consequences of protein nitration, it is necessary to develop methods for identification of nitrotyrosine-containing proteins and localization of the sites of modification.Here, we have investigated the electron capture dissociation (ECD) and collision-induced association (CID) behavior of 3-nitrotyrosine-containing peptides. The presence of nitration did not affect the CID behavior of the peptides. For the doubly-charged peptides, addition of nitration severely inhibited the production of ECD sequence fragments. However, ECD of the triply-charged nitrated peptides resulted in some singly-charged sequence fragments. ECD of the nitrated peptides is characterized by multiple losses of small neutral species including hydroxyl radicals, water and ammonia. The origin of the neutral losses has been investigated by use of activated ion (AI) ECD. Loss of ammonia appears to be the result of non-covalent interactions between the nitro group and protonated lysine side-chains.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Andrew W.","Mikhailov, Victor A.","Iniesta, Jesus","Cooper, Helen J."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9052205,"sim:weight":0.829488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19039,"sim:weight":0.827302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19299,"sim:weight":0.712945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19279,"sim:weight":0.661064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19123,"sim:weight":0.648729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19003,"sim:weight":0.646716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19249,"sim:weight":0.63179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19301,"sim:weight":0.614239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19198,"sim:weight":0.514962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19136,"sim:weight":0.45706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19135,"sim:weight":0.451586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46868,"sim:weight":0.366891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45281,"sim:weight":0.360245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19300,"sim:weight":0.33833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12349,"sim:weight":0.31641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46534,"sim:weight":0.300585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":692523,"sim:weight":0.277979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46535,"sim:weight":0.268921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.25695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25860,"sim:weight":0.214572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Signaling is initiated through phosphorylation of a single conserved tyrosine located in a YxxL sequence in the CLEC-2 cytosolic tail. The signaling pathway used by CLEC-2 shares many similarities with that used by receptors that have 1 or more copies of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, defined by the sequence Yxx(L/I)x6-12Yxx(L/I), in their cytosolic tails or associated receptor chains. Phosphorylation of the conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif tyrosines promotes Syk binding and activation through binding of the Syk tandem SH2 domains. In this report, we present evidence using peptide pull-down studies, surface plasmon resonance, quantitative Western blotting, tryptophan fluorescence measurements, and competition experiments that Syk activation by CLEC-2 is mediated by the cross-linking through the tandem SH2 domains with a stoichiometry of 2:1. In support of this model, cross-linking and electron microscopy demonstrate that CLEC-2 is present as a dimer in resting platelets and converted to larger complexes on activation.

A qualitative study.","bibo:abstract":"Background The notion \u0027hard to reach\u0027 is a contested and ambiguous term that is commonly used within the spheres of social care and health, especially in discourse around health and social inequalities. There is a need to address health inequalities and to engage in services the marginalized and socially excluded sectors of society. Methods This paper describes a pilot study involving interviews with representatives from eight Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS) organisations . The purpose of the study was to explore the notion of \u0027hard to reach\u0027 and perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to accessing services for \u0027hard to reach\u0027 groups from a voluntary and community sector perspective. Results The \u0027hard to reach\u0027 may include drug users, people living with HIV, people from sexual minority communities, asylum seekers, refugees, people from black and ethnic minority communities, and homeless people although defining the notion of the \u0027hard to reach\u0027 is not straight forward. It may be that certain groups resist engaging in treatment services and are deemed hard to reach by a particular service or from a societal stance. There are a number of potential barriers for people who may try and access services, including people having bad experiences in the past; location and opening times of services and how services are funded and managed. A number of areas of commonality are found in terms of how access to services for \u0027hard to reach\u0027 individuals and groups could be improved including: respectful treatment of service users, establishing trust with service users, offering service flexibility, partnership working with other organisations and harnessing service user involvement. \n \nConclusions: If health services are to engage with groups that are deemed \u0027hard to reach\u0027 and marginalised from mainstream health services, the experiences and practices for engagement from within the VCS may serve as useful lessons for service improvement for statutory health services.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flanagan, Sarah M","Hancock, Beverley"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.490777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.470967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.460757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98472,"sim:weight":0.435289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109025,"sim:weight":0.435124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76513,"sim:weight":0.408563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.387288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.387288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":115036,"sim:weight":0.376833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.368264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385778,"sim:weight":0.347871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48236,"sim:weight":0.33703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.280061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998639,"sim:weight":0.269716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.262235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45371,"sim:weight":0.250675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.239956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43687,"sim:weight":0.209157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10062,"sim:weight":0.206747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43346,"sim:weight":0.20155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Our aim was to develop a reproducible invasively-monitored porcine model of acetaminophen-induced ALF. \n \nMethod: 35kg pigs were maintained under general anaesthesia and invasively monitored. Control pigs received a saline infusion, whereas ALF pigs received acetaminophen intravenously for 12 hours to maintain blood concentrations between 200-300 mg/l. Animals surviving 28 hours were euthanased. \n \nResults: Cytochrome p450 levels in phenobarbital pre-treated animals were significantly higher than non pre-treated animals (300 vs 100 pmol/mg protein). Control pigs (n\u003d4) survived 28-hour anaesthesia without incident. Of nine pigs that received acetaminophen, four survived 20 hours and two survived 28 hours. Injured animals developed hypotension (mean arterial pressure; 40.8+/-5.9 vs 59+/-2.0 mmHg), increased cardiac output (7.26+/-1.86 vs 3.30+/-0.40 l/min) and decreased systemic vascular resistance (8.48+/-2.75 vs 16.2+/-1.76 mPa/s/m3). Dyspnoea developed as liver injury progressed and the increased pulmonary vascular resistance (636+/-95 vs 301+/-26.9 mPa/s/m3) observed may reflect the development of respiratory distress syndrome. Liver damage was confirmed by deterioration in pH (7.23+/-0.05 vs 7.45+/-0.02) and prothrombin time (36+/-2 vs 8.9+/-0.3 seconds) compared with controls. Factor V and VII levels were reduced to 9.3 and 15.5% of starting values in injured animals. A marked increase in serum AST (471.5+/-210 vs 42+/-8.14) coincided with a marked reduction in serum albumin (11.5+/-1.71 vs 25+/-1 g/dL) in injured animals. Animals displayed evidence of renal impairment; mean creatinine levels 280.2+/-36.5 vs 131.6+/-9.33 mumol/l. Liver histology revealed evidence of severe centrilobular necrosis with coagulative necrosis. Marked renal tubular necrosis was also seen. Methaemoglobin levels did not rise \u003e5%. Intracranial hypertension was not seen (ICP monitoring), but there was biochemical evidence of encephalopathy by the reduction of Fischer\u0027s ratio from 5.6 +/- 1.1 to 0.45 +/- 0.06. \n \nConclusion: We have developed a reproducible large animal model of acetaminophen-induced liver failure, which allows in-depth investigation of the pathophysiological basis of this condition. Furthermore, this represents an important large animal model for testing artificial liver support systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Newsome, Philip N","Henderson, Neil C","Nelson, Leonard J","Dabos, Costas","Filippi, Celine","Bellamy, Chris","Howie, Forbes","Clutton, Richard E","King, Tim","Lee, Alistair","Hayes, Peter C","Plevris, John N"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.28005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76351,"sim:weight":0.268343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.258777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":468646,"sim:weight":0.237399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.235741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.233005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76491,"sim:weight":0.229952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.220703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98986,"sim:weight":0.219735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98568,"sim:weight":0.216931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101310,"sim:weight":0.207358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.206946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.188261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98860,"sim:weight":0.18728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8747712,"sim:weight":0.184717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101347,"sim:weight":0.183721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.180073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101909,"sim:weight":0.170591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.16899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.163327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":19183,"ep:Repository":120,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Gene doctoring: a method for recombineering in laboratory and pathogenic Escherichia coli strains","bibo:abstract":"Background: Homologous recombination mediated by the lambda-Red genes is a common method for making chromosomal modifications in Escherichia coli. Several protocols have been developed that differ in the mechanisms by which DNA, carrying regions homologous to the chromosome, are delivered into the cell. A common technique is to electroporate linear DNA fragments into cells. Alternatively, DNA fragments are generated in vivo by digestion of a donor plasmid with a nuclease that does not cleave the host genome. In both cases the lambda-Red gene products recombine homologous regions carried on the linear DNA fragments with the chromosome. We have successfully used both techniques to generate chromosomal mutations in E. coli K-12 strains. However, we have had limited success with these lambda-Red based recombination techniques in pathogenic E. coli strains, which has led us to develop an enhanced protocol for recombineering in such strains. \r\n \r\nResults: Our goal was to develop a high-throughput recombineering system, primarily for the coupling of genes to epitope tags, which could also be used for deletion of genes in both pathogenic and K-12 E. coli strains. To that end we have designed a series of donor plasmids for use with the lambda-Red recombination system, which when cleaved in vivo by the I-SceI meganuclease generate a discrete linear DNA fragment, allowing for C-terminal tagging of chromosomal genes with a 6xHis, 3xFLAG, 4xProteinA or GFP tag or for the deletion of chromosomal regions. We have enhanced existing protocols and technologies by inclusion of a cassette conferring kanamycin resistance and, crucially, by including the sacB gene on the donor plasmid, so that all but true recombinants are counter-selected on kanamycin and sucrose containing media, thus eliminating the need for extensive screening. This method has the added advantage of limiting the exposure of cells to the potential damaging effects of the lambda-Red system, which can lead to unwanted secondary alterations to the chromosome. \r\n \r\nConclusion: We have developed a counter-selective recombineering technique for epitope tagging or for deleting genes in E. coli. We have demonstrated the versatility of the technique by modifying the chromosome of the enterohaemorrhagic O157:H7 (EHEC), uropathogenic CFT073 (UPEC), enteroaggregative O42 (EAEC) and enterotoxigenic H10407 (ETEC) E. coli strains as well as in K-12 laboratory strains.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee, David J","Bingle, Lewis EH","Heurlier, Karin","Pallen, Mark J.","Penn, Charles W","Busby, Stephen J.

Guidelines for pain management recommend regular and pre-emptive use of analgesics to reduce the impact of pain. Clinical experience indicates that analgesics are often not used in this way. Studies exploring use of analgesics in arthritis have historically measured adherence to such medication. Here we examine patterns of analgesic use and their relationships to pain, self-efficacy and demographic factors. \n \nMethods: Consecutive patients were approached in a hospital rheumatology out-patient clinic. Pattern of analgesic use was assessed by response to statements such as \u0027I always take my tablets every day.\u0027 Pain and self-efficacy (SE) were measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES). Influence of factors on pain level and regularity of analgesic use were investigated using linear regression. Differences in pain between those agreeing and disagreeing with statements regarding analgesic use were assessed using t-tests. \n \nResults: 218 patients (85% of attendees) completed the study. Six (2.8%) patients reported no current pain, 26 (12.3%) slight, 100 (47.4%) moderate, 62 (29.4%) severe and 17 (8.1%) extreme pain. In multiple linear regression self efficacy and regularity of analgesic use were significant (p \u003c 0.01) with lower self efficacy and more regular use of analgesics associated with more pain. \n \nLow SE was associated with greater pain: 40 (41.7%) people with low SE reported severe pain versus 22 (18.3%) people with high SE, p \u003c 0.001. Patients in greater pain were significantly more likely to take analgesics regularly; 13 (77%) of those in extreme pain reported always taking their analgesics every day, versus 9 (35%) in slight pain. Many patients, including 46% of those in severe pain, adjusted analgesic use to current pain level. In simple linear regression, pain was the only variable significantly associated with regularity of analgesic use: higher levels of pain corresponded to more regular analgesic use (p \u003d 0.003). \n \nConclusion: Our study confirms that there is a strong inverse relationship between self-efficacy and pain severity. Analgesics are often used irregularly by people with arthritis, including some reporting severe pain.","bibo:AuthorList":["Blamey, Ruth","Jolly, Kate","Greenfield, S.M.","Jobanputra, Paresh"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23329,"sim:weight":0.451435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99453,"sim:weight":0.43713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46624,"sim:weight":0.414492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43246,"sim:weight":0.412758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336840,"sim:weight":0.399865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108868,"sim:weight":0.383633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.336459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19359,"sim:weight":0.292096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.274822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.269259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337089,"sim:weight":0.267666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50119,"sim:weight":0.244135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77115,"sim:weight":0.241207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43411,"sim:weight":0.238121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.232527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335728,"sim:weight":0.228062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103085,"sim:weight":0.220555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.218284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.214414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.206001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is associated with reduced life expectancy, cardiovascular problems, a variety of insidiously progressing detrimental symptoms and metabolic malfunction. Treatments include surgery, radiotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Pegvisomant (PEG) is a genetically engineered GH analogue licensed as a third or fourth line option when other treatments have failed to normalise IGF-1 levels. \n \nMethods: Evidence about effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PEG was systematically reviewed. Data were extracted from published studies and used for a narrative synthesis of evidence. A decision analytical economic model was identified and modified to assess the cost-effectiveness of PEG. \n \nResults: One RCT and 17 non-randomised studies were reviewed for effectiveness. PEG substantially reduced and rapidly normalised IGF-1 levels in the majority of patients, approximately doubled GH levels, and improved some of the signs and symptoms of the disease. Tumour size was unaffected at least in the short term. PEG had a generally safe adverse event profile but a few patients were withdrawn from treatment because of raised liver enzymes. An economic model was identified and adapted to estimate the lower limit for the cost-effectiveness of PEG treatment versus standard care. Over a 20 year time horizon the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound81,000/QALY and pound212,000/LYG. To reduce this to pound30K/QALY would require a reduction in drug cost by about one third. \n \nConclusion: PEG is highly effective for improving patients\u0027 IGF-1 level. Signs and symptoms of disease improve but evidence is lacking about long term effects on improved signs and symptoms of disease, quality of life, patient compliance and safety. Economic evaluation indicated that if current standards (UK) for determining cost-effectiveness of therapies were to be applied to PEG it would be considered not to represent good value for money.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, David J","Adi, Yaser","Connock, Martin J","Bayliss, Sue"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.408165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9028213,"sim:weight":0.327448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24375,"sim:weight":0.314674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1151822,"sim:weight":0.311477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24404,"sim:weight":0.310564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.302186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.301351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23113,"sim:weight":0.29842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24379,"sim:weight":0.29842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24852,"sim:weight":0.295221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.288567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.287271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384731,"sim:weight":0.278429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76852,"sim:weight":0.277197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.27286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25893,"sim:weight":0.272254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.270107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227583,"sim:weight":0.267372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24399,"sim:weight":0.259951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.25147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There are broadly three areas where difficulties in communication about back pain arise. Firstly, patients seeking information from health care professionals can experience difficulties understanding them and the medical literature; secondly, misunderstandings among health professionals concerning terminology can arise. Thirdly, the lack of standardised definitions for back pain terms can make comparison of research studies problematic. This study aims to explore the meanings and issues surrounding the use of existing medical terms for back pain from the perspective of health care professionals, lay people who have consulted health care practitioners for back pain and lay people who have not seen a health care professional regarding back pain. \r\n \r\nMethods: A series of focus groups were used to explore participants\u0027 understanding. A purposive sampling approach was used to achieve a sample which included general practitioners, chiropractors, osteopaths, physiotherapists, and lay people. Focus groups were facilitated by an independent professional qualitative researcher. They were audio taped and full transcripts of each focus group underwent line by line analysis, identifying concepts and coded. Constant comparison was used to allow each item to be checked or compared against the rest of the data \r\n \r\nResults: Lay participants understood the majority of the terms explored in the group differently to the health professionals. The terms, as understood by the lay participants, can be split into three broad categories. Firstly, terms which were not understood or were misconstrued and which had inadvertent negative connotations or implications. Secondly, terms which were not understood or were misconstrued, but without this leading to negative emotional responses. Thirdly, terms which were understood by lay participants as the health professionals stated they intended them to be understood. \r\n \r\nConclusion: Few of the existing medical terms were understood and accepted by lay participants in the way discussed and expected by health professionals. Misunderstandings, unintended meanings and negative emotional responses to terms were common within the study focus groups.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barker, Karen L","Reid, Margaret","Lowe, Catherine"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":102701,"sim:weight":0.55018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46624,"sim:weight":0.478717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383383,"sim:weight":0.475919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45883,"sim:weight":0.430112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336021,"sim:weight":0.41773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381997,"sim:weight":0.41535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101268,"sim:weight":0.411544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386691,"sim:weight":0.410029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103140,"sim:weight":0.389119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101445,"sim:weight":0.387726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":335445,"sim:weight":0.384429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385778,"sim:weight":0.38036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.378501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23524,"sim:weight":0.375553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.375272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269918,"sim:weight":0.373845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56397,"sim:weight":0.371179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.368492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43411,"sim:weight":0.362481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383650,"sim:weight":0.359748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this study is to investigate whether there are differences in course-related stressors reported by medical students on undergraduate problem-based learning (PBL) and non-PBL programmes in the UK. \n \nMethod: A cross-sectional study of second-year medical students in two UK medical schools (one PBL and one non-PBL programme) was conducted. A 16-question self-report questionnaire, derived from the Perceived Medical Student Stress Scale and the Higher Education Stress Inventory, was used to measure course-related stressors. Following univariate analysis of each stressor between groups, multivariate logistic regression was used to determine which stressors were the best predictors of each course type, while controlling for socio-demographic differences between the groups. \n \nResults: A total of 280 students responded. Compared to the non-PBL students (N \u003d 197), the PBL students (N \u003d 83) were significantly more likely to agree that: they did not know what the faculty expected of them (Odds Ratio (OR) \u003d 0.38, p \u003d 0.03); there were too many small group sessions facilitated only by students resulting in an unclear curriculum (OR \u003d 0.04, p \u003c 0.0001); and that there was a lack of opportunity to explore academic subjects of interest (OR \u003d 0.40, p \u003d 0.02). They were significantly more likely to disagree that: there was a lack of encouragement from teachers (OR \u003d 3.11, p \u003d 0.02); and that the medical course fostered a sense of anonymity and feelings of isolation amongst students (OR \u003d 3.42, p \u003d 0.008). \n \nConclusion: There are significant differences in the perceived course-related stressors affecting medical students on PBL and non-PBL programmes. Course designers and student support services should therefore tailor their work to minimise, or help students cope with, the specific stressors on each course type to ensure optimum learning and wellbeing among our future doctors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lewis, Alexander D","Menezes, Darryl","McDermott, Helen E","Hibbert, Louise J","Brennan, Sarah-Louise","Ross, Elizabeth E","Jones, Lisa A"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5465,"sim:weight":0.33174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.285425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.283608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.226622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.225864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.222962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.183812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.180362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.169862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99226,"sim:weight":0.166702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43790,"sim:weight":0.149685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.129416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43950,"sim:weight":0.107868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.104529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43576,"sim:weight":0.0830585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47157,"sim:weight":0.0822567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5941,"sim:weight":0.0791974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.0734909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53596,"sim:weight":0.0725657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Currently EBM is predominantly taught through theoretical courses, workshops and e-learning. However, clinical teachers lack confidence in teaching EBM in workplace and are often unsure of the existing opportunities for teaching EBM in the clinical setting. There is a need for continuing professional development (CPD) courses that train clinical trainers to teach EBM through on-the-job training by demonstration of applied EBM real time in clinical practice. We developed such a course to encourage clinically relevant teaching of EBM in post-graduate education in various clinical environments. \n \nMethods: We devised an e-learning course targeting trainers with EBM knowledge to impart educational methods needed to teach application of EBM teaching in commonly used clinical settings. The curriculum development group comprised experienced EBM teachers, clinical epidemiologists, clinicians and educationalists from institutions in seven European countries. The e-learning sessions were designed to allow participants (teachers) to undertake the course in the workplace during short breaks within clinical activities. An independent European steering committee provided input into the process. \n \nResults: The curriculum defined specific learning objectives for teaching EBM by exploiting educational opportunities in six different clinical settings. The e-modules incorporated video clips that demonstrate practical and effective methods of EBM teaching in everyday clinical practice. The course encouraged focussed teaching activities embedded within a trainer\u0027s personal learning plan and documentation in a CPD portfolio for reflection. \n \nConclusion: This curriculum will help senior clinicians to identify and make the best use of available opportunities in everyday practice in clinical situations to teach various steps of EBM and demonstrate their applicability to clinical practice. Once fully implemented, the ultimate outcome of this pilot project will be a European qualification in teaching EBM, which will be used by doctors, hospitals, professional bodies responsible for postgraduate qualifications and continuing medical education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thangaratinam, Shakila","Barnfield, Gemma","Weinbrenner, Susanne","Meyerrose, Berit","Arvanitis, Theodoros N","Horvath, Andrea R","Zanrei, Gianni","Kunz, Regina","Suter, Katja","Walczak, Jacek","Kaleta, Anna","Rengerink, Katrien","Gee, Harry","Mol, Ben WJ","Khan, Khalid S"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19010,"sim:weight":0.778117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.349838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5465,"sim:weight":0.329969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.328499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.327074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.316344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654523,"sim:weight":0.313156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5193190,"sim:weight":0.297439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.289044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.286352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48298,"sim:weight":0.279387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387062,"sim:weight":0.272706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.265394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.265394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.265394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.265394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.265394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.265394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.265394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.265394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Rodent models demonstrate that over-expression of Pck1 can result in T2D development and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of human PCK1 (-232C/G) has exhibited significant association with the disease in several cohorts. Within the UK-resident South Asian population, T2D is 4 to 6 times more common than in indigenous white Caucasians. Despite this, few studies have reported on the genetic susceptibility to T2D in this ethnic group and none of these has investigated the possible effect of PCK1 variants. We therefore aimed to investigate the association between common variants of the PCK1 gene and T2D in a UK-resident South Asian population of Punjabi ancestry, originating predominantly from the Mirpur area of Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. \r\n \r\nMethods: We used TaqMan assays to genotype five tagSNPs covering the PCK1 gene, including the -232C/G variant, in 903 subjects with T2D and 471 normoglycaemic controls. \r\n \r\nResults: Of the variants studied, only the minor allele (G) of the -232C/G SNP demonstrated a significant association with T2D, displaying an OR of 1.21 (95% CI: 1.03 - 1.42, p \u003d 0.019). \r\n \r\nConclusion: This study is the first to investigate the association between variants of the PCK1 gene and T2D in South Asians.

METHODS: Forty two patients, aged 48.7 +/- 2.3 yrs (mean +/- SEM) underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) for the quantification of left ventricular volumes and extent of non-compacted (NC) myocardium. The latter was quantified using planimetry on the two-chamber long axis LV view (NC area). The patients included those referred specifically for CMR to investigate suspected cardiomyopathy, and as such is represents a selected group of patients. RESULTS: At presentation, 50% had dyspnoea, 19% chest pain, 14% palpitations and 5% stroke. Pulmonary embolism had occurred in 7% and brachial artery embolism in 2%. The ECG was abnormal in 81% and atrial fibrillation occurred in 29%. Transthoracic echocardiograms showed features of NC in only 10%. On CMR, patients who presented with dyspnoea had greater left ventricular volumes (both p \u003c 0.0001) and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p \u003c 0.0001) than age-matched, healthy controls. In patients without dyspnoea (n \u003d 21), NC area correlated positively with end-diastolic volume (r \u003d 0.52, p \u003d 0.0184) and end-systolic volume (r \u003d 0.56, p \u003d 0.0095), and negatively with EF (r \u003d -0.72, p \u003d 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Left ventricular non-compaction is associated with dysrrhythmias, thromboembolic events, chest pain and LV dysfunction. The inverse correlation between NC area and EF suggests that NC contributes to left ventricular dysfunction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yousef, Zaheer R","Foley, Paul WX","Khadjooi, Kayvan","Chalil, Shajil","Sandman, Harald","Mohammed, Noor UH","Leyva, Francisco"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1117971,"sim:weight":0.436412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033647,"sim:weight":0.373323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25854,"sim:weight":0.329042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98765,"sim:weight":0.3091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1029580,"sim:weight":0.295399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":759377,"sim:weight":0.287416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.268978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387164,"sim:weight":0.266403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1032881,"sim:weight":0.254097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.246807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1029220,"sim:weight":0.24472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.238446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1034203,"sim:weight":0.237042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033216,"sim:weight":0.22953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.225401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43760,"sim:weight":0.224057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033686,"sim:weight":0.22159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19350,"sim:weight":0.219434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101310,"sim:weight":0.215898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":501130,"sim:weight":0.204712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

More than two years later, over 14,500 families were still living in transitional shelters. This study compares the health of the internally displaced people (IDP), living in transitional camps with those in permanent housing projects provided by government and non-government organisations in Sri Lanka. METHODS: This study was conducted in seven transitional camps and five permanent housing projects in the south west of Sri Lanka. Using an interviewer-led questionnaire, data on the IDPs\u0027 self-reported health and housing conditions were collected from 154 participants from transitional camps and 147 participants from permanent housing projects. Simple tabulation with non-parametric tests and logistic regression were used to identify and analyse relationships between housing conditions and the reported prevalence of specific symptoms. RESULTS: Analysis showed that living conditions were significantly worse in transitional camps than in permanent housing projects for all factors investigated, except \u0027having a leaking roof\u0027. Transitional camp participants scored significantly lower on self-perceived overall health scores than those living in housing projects. After controlling for gender, age and marital status, living in a transitional camp compared to a housing project was found to be a significant risk factor for the following symptoms; coughs OR: 3.53 (CI: 2.11-5.89), stomach ache 4.82 (2.19-10.82), headache 5.20 (3.09-8.76), general aches and pains 6.44 (3.67-11.33) and feeling generally unwell 2.28 (2.51-7.29). Within transitional camp data, the only condition shown to be a significant risk factor for any symptom was household population density, which increased the risk of stomach aches 1.40 (1.09-1.79) and headaches 1.33 (1.01-1.77). CONCLUSION: Internally displaced people living in transitional camps are a vulnerable population and specific interventions need to be targeted at this population to address the health inequalities that they report to be experiencing.

Ninety-one boys (mean age \u003d 13.82 years) involved in an elite soccer program completed multisection questionnaires capturing the targeted variables. Measures were obtained on five occasions across two competitive seasons. Multilevel regression analyses revealed that MAp goals positively, and MAv goals negatively, predicted within-person changes in well-being over two seasons. PAp goal adoption was positively associated to within-person changes in negative affect. PAv goals corresponded negatively to between-person mean differences in positive affect. The results of the indirect effects showed challenge appraisals accounted for within-person associations between a MAp goal focus and well- and ill-being over time.

In animals, these traits are regulated, at least in part, by forkhead transcription factors in response to upstream signals from the Insulin/Insulin– like growth factor signalling (IIS) pathway. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, these phenotypes are molecularly linked such that activation of the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16 both extends lifespan and simultaneously increases immunity and stress resistance. It is known that lifespan varies significantly among the Caenorhabditis species but, although DAF-16 signalling is highly conserved, it is unclear whether this phenotypic linkage occurs in other species. Here we investigate this phenotypic covariance by comparing longevity, stress resistance and immunity in four \r\nCaenorhabditis species. \r\n \r\nMethodology/Principal Findings \r\nWe show using phenotypic analysis of DAF-16 influenced phenotypes that among four closely related Caenorhabditis nematodes, the gonochoristic species (Caenorhabditis remanei and Caenorhabditis brenneri) have diverged \r\nsignificantly with a longer lifespan, improved stress resistance and higher immunity than the hermaphroditic species (C. elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae). Interestingly, we also observe significant differences in expression levels between the daf-16 homologues in these species using Real-Time PCR, which positively correlate with the observed phenotypes. Finally, we provide additional evidence in support of a role for DAF-16 in regulating phenotypic coupling by using a combination of wildtype isolates, constitutively active daf-16 mutants and bioinformatic analysis. \r\n \r\nConclusions \r\nThe gonochoristic species display a significantly longer lifespan (p \u003c 0.0001)and more robust immune and stress response (p\u003c0.0001, thermal stress; p\u003c0.01, heavy metal stress; p\u003c0.0001, pathogenic stress) than the hermaphroditic species. Our data suggests that divergence in DAF-16 mediated phenotypes may underlie many of the differences observed between these four species of Caenorhabditis nematodes. These findings are further supported by the correlative higher daf-16 expression levels among the gonochoristic species and significantly higher lifespan, immunity and stress tolerance in the constitutively active daf-16 hermaphroditic mutants.","bibo:AuthorList":["Amrit, Francis R G","Boehnisch, Claudia M.

It requires small sample volumes and has given rise to improved specificity and short analysis times. Its growth has been fueled by criticism of the validity of steroid analysis by older techniques, testosterone measurements being a prime example. While this approach is the gold-standard for measurement of individual steroids, and panels of such compounds, LC/MS/MS is of limited use in defining novel metabolomes. GC/MS, in contrast, is unsuited to rapid high-sensitivity analysis of specific compounds, but remains the most powerful discovery tool for defining steroid disorder metabolomes. Since the 1930s almost all inborn errors in steroidogenesis have been first defined through their urinary steroid excretion. In the last 30 years, this has been exclusively carried out by GC/MS and has defined conditions such as AME syndrome, glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism (GRA) and Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome. Our recent foci have been on P450 oxidoreductase deficiency (ORD) and apparent cortisone reductase deficiency (ACRD). \n \nIn contrast to LC/MS/MS methodology, a particular benefit of GC/MS is its non-selective nature; a scanned run will contain every steroid excreted, providing an integrated picture of an individual\u0027s metabolome. The “Achilles heel” of clinical GC/MS profiling may be data presentation. There is lack of familiarity with the multiple hormone metabolites excreted and diagnostic data are difficult for endocrinologists to comprehend. While several conditions are defined by the absolute concentration of steroid metabolites, many are readily diagnosed by ratios between steroid metabolites (precursor metabolite/product metabolite). Our work has led us to develop a simplified graphical representation of quantitative urinary steroid hormone profiles and diagnostic ratios.","bibo:AuthorList":["Krone, Nils","Hughes, Beverly","Lavery, Gareth G.","Stewart, P M","Shackleton, Cedric H.L.","Arlt, Wiebke"],"dc:date":"2010-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":333971,"sim:weight":0.445293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7439,"sim:weight":0.307921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46868,"sim:weight":0.280793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":692523,"sim:weight":0.277068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46534,"sim:weight":0.259569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44827,"sim:weight":0.255753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46535,"sim:weight":0.20203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97721,"sim:weight":0.142349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.139687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":64141,"sim:weight":0.132769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.116952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101231,"sim:weight":0.116467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3158,"sim:weight":0.110348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.101708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63741,"sim:weight":0.0988782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19305,"sim:weight":0.0893406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.0855728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26719,"sim:weight":0.0843964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.0751841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.0714572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Protein database search engines currently available are designed for low resolution CID data, from which Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) ECD data differs significantly. ECD mass spectra contain both z-prime and z-dot fragment ions (and c-prime and c-dot); ECD mass spectra contain abundant peaks derived from neutral losses from charge-reduced precursor ions; FT-ICR ECD spectra are acquired with a larger precursor m/z isolation window than their low-resolution CID counterparts. Here, we consider three distinct stages of postacquisition analysis: (1) processing of ECD mass spectra prior to the database search; (2) the database search step itself and (3) postsearch processing of results. We demonstrate that each of these steps has an effect on the number of peptides identified, with the postsearch processing of results having the largest effect. We compare two commonly used search engines: Mascot and OMSSA. Using an ECD data set of modest size (3341 mass spectra) from a complex sample (mouse whole cell lysate), we demonstrate that search results can be improved from 630 identifications (19% identification success rate) to 1643 identifications (49% identification success rate). We focus in particular on improving identification rates for doubly charged precursors, which are typically low for ECD fragmentation.

Exercisers (n¼375) from ten health clubs in the North of England completed questionnaires measuring exercise motivation, exercise stages of change, number of relapses from exercise, future intention to exercise, barriers self-efficacy, physical self-worth and social physique anxiety. Controlling for age and sex, multiple and logistic regression analyses supported our hypotheses by showing self-determined motivation (i.e. intrinsic motivation and identified regulation) to predict more adaptive behavioural, cognitive and physical self-evaluation patterns than external regulation and amotivation. Introjected regulation was related to both adaptive and maladaptive outcomes. Furthermore, a multivariate analysis of variance revealed that exercisers in the maintenance stage of change displayed significantly more self determined motivation to exercise than those in the preparation and action stages. The results illustrate the importance of promoting self-determined motivation in exercisers to improve the quality of their experiences, as well as to foster their exercise behaviour. Future research should examine the mechanisms that promote self-determined motivation in exercise.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thøgersen-Ntoumani, Cecilie","Ntoumanis, Nikos"],"dc:date":"2006-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18997,"sim:weight":0.71869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19109,"sim:weight":0.664198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387053,"sim:weight":0.566414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19108,"sim:weight":0.53463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19162,"sim:weight":0.496097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19166,"sim:weight":0.49205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19114,"sim:weight":0.481438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53691,"sim:weight":0.475351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19115,"sim:weight":0.459157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103625,"sim:weight":0.451762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19154,"sim:weight":0.435839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50119,"sim:weight":0.43258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19142,"sim:weight":0.409023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98621,"sim:weight":0.381351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101201,"sim:weight":0.37578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101471,"sim:weight":0.37578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52534,"sim:weight":0.372685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43807,"sim:weight":0.356451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930580,"sim:weight":0.336946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75447,"sim:weight":0.330391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For example, ethambutol targets arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) biosynthesis through the inhibition of several arabinofuranosyltransferases. Apart from their role in cell-wall integrity, mycobacterial LAMs also exhibit important immunomodulatory activities. Here we report the isolation and detailed structural characterization of a unique LAM molecule derived from Mycobacterium smegmatis deficient in the arabinofuranosyltransferase AftC (AftC-LAM). This mutant LAM expresses a severely truncated arabinan domain completely devoid of 3,5-Araf–branching residues, revealing an intrinsic involvement of AftC in the biosynthesis of LAM. Furthermore, we found that ethambutol efficiently inhibits biosynthesis of the AftC-LAM arabinan core, unambiguously demonstrating the involvement of the arabinofuranosyltransferase EmbC in early stages of LAM-arabinan biosynthesis. Finally, we demonstrate that AftC-LAM exhibits an enhanced proinflammatory activity, which is due to its ability to activate Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Overall, our efforts further describe the mechanism of action of an important antitubercular drug, ethambutol, and demonstrate a role for specific arabinofuranosyltransferases in LAM biosynthesis. In addition, the availability of sufficient amounts of chemically defined wild-type and isogenic truncated LAMs paves the way for further investigations of the structure–function relationship of TLR2 activation by mycobacterial lipoglycans.","bibo:AuthorList":["Birch, Helen","Alderwick, Luke J.","Appelmelk, B.

Their common theme is equity, in formal education and beyond, in wider family and social settings, and with inequity expressed as the stratification of a variety of educational outcomes. The projects are based on a standard mixture of pre-existing records, official documents, large-scale surveys, observations, interviews and focus groups. The numeric data were largely used to create biographical models of educational experiences, and the in-depth data were used to try to explain individual decisions and disparities at each stage of the model. Data have been collected for England and Wales, in five other countries of the European Union and for Japan. A meta-view of these various findings suggests that national school intakes tend to be at least moderately segregated by prior attainment and socio-economic factors, and that learning outcomes as assessed by formal means, such as examinations, are heavily stratified by these same factors. There is no convincing evidence that compulsory schooling does very much to overcome the initial disparity in the resources and attainment of school intakes. On the other hand, there are indications that the nature of a national school system and the social experiences of young people in schools can begin to equalise educational outcomes as more widely envisaged, including learning to trust and willingness to help others, aspirations, and attitudes to continuing in education and training. The cost-free implications of the argument in this paper, if accepted, are that everything possible should be done to make school intakes comprehensive, and that explicit consideration, by teachers and leaders, of the applied principles of equity could reduce potentially harmful misunderstandings in educational contexts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gorard, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2010-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19055,"sim:weight":0.770868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19050,"sim:weight":0.612345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.59169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.582619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49910,"sim:weight":0.578455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19172,"sim:weight":0.571882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19051,"sim:weight":0.562745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269878,"sim:weight":0.55371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18991,"sim:weight":0.547867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101496,"sim:weight":0.54742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.529034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.52809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19173,"sim:weight":0.510625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19208,"sim:weight":0.491945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.487871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383349,"sim:weight":0.484372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.467407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101576,"sim:weight":0.439747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19206,"sim:weight":0.409587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.401297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The composition of secondary schools in England since 1996","bibo:abstract":"This paper presents a new analysis of segregation between schools in terms of pupils living in poverty, for all secondary schools in England from 1996 to 2005. This shows that the clustering of similar pupils in specific schools increased noticeably from 1996 to 2001, but then settled at a level still below that of 1989 when official records began. The analysis uses four estimates of segregation using figures for take-up of, and eligibility for, free school meals compiled to create both the dissimilarity index and what has been termed the Gorard index of segregation. All four estimates give the same substantive results and the findings for the dissimilarity index and the Gorard index of segregation using either measure of free school meals are indistinguishable. The two indices are, therefore, measuring the same thing. However, the Gorard index of segregation is again shown to be more tolerant of the precise measure being used and so more strongly composition invariant than the dissimilarity index. This has important implications both for the past debate on how to measure segregation between schools and for how education authorities go about estimating segregation in the future.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gorard, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2009-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19051,"sim:weight":0.833267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82296,"sim:weight":0.503205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.390756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.389839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.35251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19208,"sim:weight":0.348725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.34231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.341688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.321755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.254961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.25231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.242146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381992,"sim:weight":0.231884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19206,"sim:weight":0.224993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43722,"sim:weight":0.222465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929889,"sim:weight":0.197373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49910,"sim:weight":0.189195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50117,"sim:weight":0.188234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48401,"sim:weight":0.151017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45828,"sim:weight":0.150467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although the secondary data are drawn mainly from England, the comprehensiveness of these datasets, together with our inclusion of a review of international studies on maths and science participation (such as Wobmann 2003, Marks 2007), provides a useful reference point for an international audience. The research was prompted by concerns over a reduction in the uptake of the physical sciences post-16 and especially in higher education (HE), and interest in ways of encouraging the study of science by students from less prestigious socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds. Such concerns are not unique to the UK (Berends et al 2005, Fullarton et al 2003, Khoury and Voss 1985, Yang 2003). Using large-scale official datasets we show that participation and attainment in science are stratified by socio-economic status (SES). Students from poorer families are less likely to take sciences at post-16 than many other subjects, and those who do are then less likely to obtain grades high enough to encourage further study of the subject. \n \nNo conclusive evidence has been found to explain this satisfactorily. Plausible reasons suggested in the literature include the relative scarcity of local opportunities putting off those who do not wish to study away from home, or the perceived time demands of studying science, and so the difficulties of combining part-time study and part-time work for those needing to continue earning while studying. Direct support from professional parents may also lead to greater participation in post-16 science for students from higher SES. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that participation in science at any level is often predicated upon success at the previous educational stage. There are clear differences in science attainment at age 16 between students of differing backgrounds, which could explain the subsequent differential participation. However, these differences are not dissimilar to those for all subjects. The largest gap presented in the paper is between students eligible and not eligible for free school meals (FSM). We also show that these patterns appear early in the life of children. At ages 7 and 11, attainment in the three core subjects (English Maths and Science) is negatively related to living in an area of deprivation. The paper ends with a discussion of suggestions for research, policy and practice, emerging from this review of the evidence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gorard, Stephen","See, Beng Huat"],"dc:date":"2009-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4155856,"sim:weight":0.698523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82850,"sim:weight":0.654912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19055,"sim:weight":0.60293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.571005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.501831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48401,"sim:weight":0.498015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.493072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19203,"sim:weight":0.491945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.480068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.460507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101496,"sim:weight":0.44526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101495,"sim:weight":0.431382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.421011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82296,"sim:weight":0.417888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.417873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.417873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93645,"sim:weight":0.416578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.4098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.402376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93631,"sim:weight":0.396656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Würzburg Universitätsbibliothek M.p.th.f.67, a ninth-century gospel book possibly of Breton origin, has been called a ‘mixed text’ although it has not hitherto featured in the list of Old Latin manuscripts published by the Institut Vetus Latina. A full collation of the text of John reveals that in two portions (John 1:1-5:40 and John 12:34-13:10) it may be categorised as Old Latin. Many non-Vulgate readings in these passages are shared with other Old Latin codices (notably Codex Rehdigeranus), while other variants peculiar to this manuscript correspond to citations by Augustine and Jerome. It is also one of the very few Latin witnesses to an additional phrase in John 8:9. Although the Synoptic Gospels have not been collated, they too have a partial Old Latin affiliation, which is particularly extensive in Matthew. As a result of this study, this manuscript has now been given the number Vetus Latina 11A.","bibo:AuthorList":["Houghton, H.A.G."],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19209,"sim:weight":0.492544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19098,"sim:weight":0.410258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19253,"sim:weight":0.344157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77391,"sim:weight":0.335405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44409,"sim:weight":0.245727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269903,"sim:weight":0.21233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17841,"sim:weight":0.18834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109135,"sim:weight":0.17175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99017,"sim:weight":0.169175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46774,"sim:weight":0.148596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43870,"sim:weight":0.12851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76928,"sim:weight":0.127851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101489,"sim:weight":0.111652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43906,"sim:weight":0.0769627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51813,"sim:weight":0.0658472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43578,"sim:weight":0.0654372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43241,"sim:weight":0.0630198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43291,"sim:weight":0.0628223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43677,"sim:weight":0.0612508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43689,"sim:weight":0.0564713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This practice is based on a widespread confusion between two conditional probabilities. A worked example and other elements of logical argument demonstrate the flaw in statistical testing as currently conducted, even when strict protocols are met. Assessment of significance cannot be standardised and requires knowledge of an underlying figure that the analyst does not generally have and can not usually know. Therefore, even if all assumptions are met, the practice of statistical testing in isolation is futile. The question many people then ask in consequence is - what should we do instead? This is, perhaps, the wrong question. Rather, the question could be – why should we expect to treat randomly sampled figures differently from any other kinds of numbers, or any other forms of evidence? What we could do ‘instead’ is use figures in the same way as we would most other data, with care and judgement.

The area is under-researched and there is little evidence of comparative studies that explore similarities and differences in cross-national experiences, which is the aim of this paper. Two studies conducted in Greece and Britain that explored the views of Muslim women on school experiences of physical education are compared. Both studies focused on diaspora communities, Greek Turkish girls and British Asian women, living in predominantly non-Muslim countries. Growing concerns about global divisions between \u0027Muslims and the West\u0027 make this a particularly pertinent study. Qualitative data were collected by interviews with 24 Greek Muslim women, and 20 British Muslim women. \r\n\u003cP\u003e \r\nPhysical education has national curriculum status and a similar rationale in both countries but with different cultures of formality and tradition, which impacted on pupils\u0027 experiences. Data suggested that Greek and British groups held positive views towards physical education but were restricted on their participation in extra-curricular activities. For the British women religious identity and consciousness of Islamic requirements were more evident than for the Greek women. Differences in stages of acculturation, historical and socio-cultural contexts contributed to less problematic encounters with physical education for Greek Muslims who appeared more closely assimilated into the dominant culture.","bibo:AuthorList":["Benn, Tansin","Dagkas, Symeon"],"dc:date":"2006-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.719424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98927,"sim:weight":0.659169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090427,"sim:weight":0.616163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43669,"sim:weight":0.607802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664666,"sim:weight":0.605594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61043,"sim:weight":0.599818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.583366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43809,"sim:weight":0.573966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446416,"sim:weight":0.551442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108332,"sim:weight":0.538063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48401,"sim:weight":0.521954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.510073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.504641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43728,"sim:weight":0.503379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49910,"sim:weight":0.49438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57213,"sim:weight":0.491783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383641,"sim:weight":0.487506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383571,"sim:weight":0.461842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.456589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48394,"sim:weight":0.455946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Nutritional education versus body culture and the ballet aesthetic : the effects on the lives of female dancers.","bibo:abstract":"A key objective of this empirical study was to investigate whether improved education for dancers about nutrition has made a positive change to the body culture of the ballet world and lifestyle of female dancers. The issues were foreshadowed by sociological theories of the body, performance nutrition, and disordered eating. An interpretive, critical research approach was used to maximise the ‘insider perspective’ of the researcher, with over 20 years experience of the training and professional ballet culture. A small-scale qualitative research project aimed to capture ‘thick description’ and authentic accounts of the human realities of ballet culture from the inside. \r\nInterview and questionnaire responses were gathered from student-dancers, professional dancers, teachers/managers, and medics at a UK vocational ballet school and a company fed, to some extent, from that training school. Findings were collated with experiential observations in the daily workplace, retrospective participant observation \r\nthrough personal diaries and documentation including some biographies and autobiographies of professional dancers. \r\nThe �ndings indicated that there is still a gap between the rhetoric of nutritional education and the reality of the ballet world’s aesthetic and practices. ‘Cult-like’, \r\nauthoritarian behaviour and ‘docile’ submissive attitudes were apparent and contributed to problems with self-esteem, body image and eating disorders. Whilst dancers in \r\ntraining were better informed, pressures related to the body inside the profession dominated attitudes and behaviour. The recommendations include a re-appraisal of the \r\nballet aesthetic and body culture in the management of the profession and more empowerment of dancers to encourage them to question, critique and improve the culture of their art form rather than merely accept its ideals and demands.","bibo:AuthorList":["Benn, Tansin","Walters, Dorcas"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48267,"sim:weight":0.312238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.304521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101412,"sim:weight":0.302943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.297185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.294119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100543,"sim:weight":0.293426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.282561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.282138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382095,"sim:weight":0.277389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.27294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382006,"sim:weight":0.267413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381994,"sim:weight":0.259812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382009,"sim:weight":0.259448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101268,"sim:weight":0.257084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2916,"sim:weight":0.249126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381940,"sim:weight":0.245995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46639,"sim:weight":0.244522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47182,"sim:weight":0.243385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47041,"sim:weight":0.235992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45186,"sim:weight":0.228222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Four seminars were employed to develop and reinforce critical thinking and provide an opportunity for practise and group work. Source material included research proposals and published journal articles. Two linked pieces of coursework assessed critical thinking skills. Teaching method effectiveness was examined using the students’ questionnaire responses and comparison of coursework grades across the module. Students reported finding the seminars useful and helpful, and their self-ratings of critical appraisal skills improved from pre- to post-seminar. However, this was not generally reflected in assessment grades across the group. Overall, there was a significant decline in grades from the first to the second piece of coursework. However, although Sport and Exercise Sciences students’ scored significantly lower on the second coursework, Biosciences students scored higher. It is possible that this type of teaching helps to boost performance in students who originally are new to such skills. Future studies would need to examine whether different methods or longer follow-up might also yield improvements in objective measurements of students’ critical appraisal ability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Phillips, Anna C."],"dc:date":"2009-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.389232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102655,"sim:weight":0.378042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.366691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.362399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27452,"sim:weight":0.3497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.345564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.293635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.292456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.285998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46902,"sim:weight":0.270956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5465,"sim:weight":0.266434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18964,"sim:weight":0.264856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.24787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.24502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55679,"sim:weight":0.241145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53956,"sim:weight":0.217863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43248,"sim:weight":0.217742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43790,"sim:weight":0.197901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47232,"sim:weight":0.193248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.184768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It also claimed to show that the incomes of fathers and sons were more closely related in Britain than in countries such as Norway. However, a reconsideration of the same results in this paper leads to very different conclusions. This example is considered in detail here to illustrate the point that it is not always a good thing for research to have influence.

Cell viability was independent of the concentration of NPs in solution, but sloughing rates varied substantially, sometimes in a dose-dependent manner.

Protein kinase CK2 plays multiple roles in the regulation of gene expression and cell proliferation. Here, we show that PRH interacts with the β subunit of CK2 in vitro and in cells and that CK2 phosphorylates PRH. Phosphorylation of PRH by CK2 inhibits the DNA binding activity of this protein and dephosphorylation restores DNA binding indicating that this modification acts as a reversible switch. We show that phosphorylation of the homeodomain is sufficient to block DNA binding and we identify two amino acids within this the domain that are phosphorylated by CK2: S163 and S177. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that mutation of either of these residues to glutamic acid partially mimics phosphorylation but is insufficient to completely block DNA binding whereas an S163E/S177E double mutation severely inhibits DNA binding. Significantly, the S163E and S177E mutations and the S163E/S177E double mutation all inhibit the ability of PRH to regulate transcription in cells. Since these amino acids are conserved between many homeodomain proteins, our results suggest that CK2 may regulate the activity of several homeodomain proteins in this manner.","bibo:AuthorList":["Soufi, Abdenour","Noy, Peter","Buckle, Malcolm","Sawasdichai, Anyaporn","Gaston, Kevin","Jayaraman, Padma-Sheela"],"dc:date":"2009-06-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.1955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108826,"sim:weight":0.189705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154227,"sim:weight":0.183451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99431,"sim:weight":0.182815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929813,"sim:weight":0.181542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.172502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4182562,"sim:weight":0.16924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.168921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709895,"sim:weight":0.167023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98668,"sim:weight":0.166663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930158,"sim:weight":0.155646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384092,"sim:weight":0.153878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98670,"sim:weight":0.150963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154451,"sim:weight":0.14502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.141197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.139705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46577,"sim:weight":0.139238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387108,"sim:weight":0.136902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.136235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.135765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While the theory for understanding the cuprate metals remains controversial, there are a number of clear examples where we do believe we understand the new underlying theoretical concepts.

They are also involved in pathologic conditions resulting from blocked blood vessels, including myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation at sites of vascular injury are regulated by a diverse repertoire of tyrosine kinase–linked and G protein–coupled receptors. Src family kinases (SFKs) play a central role in initiating and propagating signaling from several platelet surface receptors; however, the underlying mechanism of how SFK activity is regulated in platelets remains unclear. CD148 is the only receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase identified in platelets to date. In the present study, we show that mutant mice lacking CD148 exhibited a bleeding tendency and defective arterial thrombosis.

Most cases are sporadic and result from epimutations at either of the two 11p15.5 imprinting centres (IC1 and IC2). However, rare familial cases may be associated with germline 11p15.5 deletions causing abnormal imprinting in cis. We report a family with BWS and an IC2 epimutation in which affected siblings had inherited different parental 11p15.5 alleles excluding an in cis mechanism. Using a positional-candidate gene approach, we found that the mother was homozygous for a frameshift mutation in exon 6 of NLRP2. While germline mutations in NLRP7 have previously been associated with familial hydatidiform mole, this is the first description of NLRP2 mutation in human disease and the first report of a trans mechanism for disordered imprinting in BWS. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that NLRP2 has a previously unrecognised role in establishing or maintaining genomic imprinting in humans.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meyer, Esther","Lim, Derek","Pasha, Shanaz","Tee, Louise J","Rahman, Fatima","Yates, John R.W","Woods, C.

To achieve this, platelets express a diverse array of cell surface receptors and signaling proteins that induce rapid platelet activation. In this study we show that two platelet glycoprotein receptors that signal via an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) or an ITAM-like domain, namely the collagen receptor complex glycoprotein VI (GPVI)-FcR γ-chain and the C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2), respectively, support constitutive (i.e. agonist-independent) signaling in a cell line model using a nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) transcriptional reporter assay that can detect low level activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ). Constitutive and agonist signaling by both receptors is dependent on Src and Syk family kinases, and is inhibited by G6b-B, a platelet immunoglobulin receptor that has two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in its cytosolic tail. Mutation of the conserved tyrosines in the two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs prevents the inhibitory action of G6b-B. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity of G6b-B is independent of the Src homology 2 (SH2)-domain containing tyrosine phosphatases, SHP1 and SHP2, and the inositol 5′-phosphatase, SHIP. Constitutive signaling via Src and Syk tyrosine kinases is observed in platelets and is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of GPVI-FcR γ-chain and CLEC-2. We speculate that inhibition of constitutive signaling through Src and Syk tyrosine kinases by G6b-B may help to prevent unwanted platelet activation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mori, Jun","Pearce, Andrew C","Spalton, Jennifer C.","Grygielska, Beata","Eble, Johannes A.","Tomlinson, Michael G.","Senis, Yotis A.","Watson, Steve P"],"dc:date":"2008-12-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19178,"sim:weight":0.69031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19265,"sim:weight":0.581824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19007,"sim:weight":0.563981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19112,"sim:weight":0.481964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19237,"sim:weight":0.475308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75810,"sim:weight":0.431235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76526,"sim:weight":0.345454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76646,"sim:weight":0.286424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10907,"sim:weight":0.251947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.218274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.210036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269995,"sim:weight":0.20266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.199966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76218,"sim:weight":0.197396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.182775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.181367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98670,"sim:weight":0.180301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99258,"sim:weight":0.170929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98615,"sim:weight":0.159368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.154184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The role of this resting state activity, evident as low-frequency fluctuations of BOLD (see [1] for review, [2-4]) or electrical [5, 6] signals, is unclear. Two major proposals are that resting state activity supports introspective thought or supports responses to future events [7]. An alternative perspective is that the resting brain actively and selectively processes previous experiences [8]. Here we show that motor learning can modulate subsequent activity within resting networks. BOLD signal was recorded during rest periods before and after an 11 min visuomotor training session. Motor learning but not motor performance modulated a fronto-parietal resting state network (RSN). Along with the fronto-parietal network, a cerebellar network not previously reported as an RSN was also specifically altered by learning. Both of these networks are engaged during learning of similar visuomotor tasks [9-22]. Thus, we provide the first description of the modulation of specific RSNs by prior learning--but not by prior performance--revealing a novel connection between the neuroplastic mechanisms of learning and resting state activity. Our approach may provide a powerful tool for exploration of the systems involved in memory consolidation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Albert, Neil B.","Robertson, Edwin M.","Miall, R.

The input and output are transitions from a coplanar structure to a rectangular coaxial line, which are then coupled into the cavity. The filter is only 3.7 mm by 2.0 mm in size and 1.0 mm in height. The measured insertion loss is 1.1 dB and the return loss is below -9 dB. The bandwidth of the tested filter is broadened due to fabrication imperfections, which have been identified by modelling and discussed in the paper.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, Yi","Ke, M.","Lancaster, M.J."],"dc:date":"2009-11-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19233,"sim:weight":0.63461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19289,"sim:weight":0.589642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19290,"sim:weight":0.50827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931560,"sim:weight":0.47798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931321,"sim:weight":0.477441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929901,"sim:weight":0.471842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101536,"sim:weight":0.45563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19288,"sim:weight":0.452442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77799,"sim:weight":0.351695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100870,"sim:weight":0.304083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352037,"sim:weight":0.298762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45684,"sim:weight":0.288468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512823,"sim:weight":0.280971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26620,"sim:weight":0.279972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9833,"sim:weight":0.277583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99111,"sim:weight":0.27736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47233,"sim:weight":0.275746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46778,"sim:weight":0.272559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24953,"sim:weight":0.267696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.261817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Linear ion trap CID was shown to be most efficient for phosphopeptide identification, whereas FT-ICR ECD was superior for localization of sites of phosphorylation. The combination of confident CID and ECD identification and confident CID and ECD localization is particularly valuable in cases where a phosphopeptide is identified just once within a phosphoproteomics experiment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sweet, Steve M.

Applications include known “coverage theorems” from locale theory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jung, Achim","Moshier, M.Andrew","Vickers, Steven"],"dc:date":"2008-10-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19262,"sim:weight":0.618237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103606,"sim:weight":0.544949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19321,"sim:weight":0.491134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19260,"sim:weight":0.467139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98983,"sim:weight":0.399133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513401,"sim:weight":0.381433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101552,"sim:weight":0.335966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.331893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393453,"sim:weight":0.307622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382821,"sim:weight":0.298977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999162,"sim:weight":0.296083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99029,"sim:weight":0.283978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98537,"sim:weight":0.27361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19255,"sim:weight":0.230813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99157,"sim:weight":0.184698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19323,"sim:weight":0.156808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46229,"sim:weight":0.107493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934419,"sim:weight":0.0800314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19261,"sim:weight":0.0745412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28207,"sim:weight":0.0744708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Research into development, disease, and the effects of drugs require cell number counts. These are generally indirect estimates, because counting cells in an animal or organ is paradoxically difficult, as well as being tedious and unmanageable. Drosophila is a powerful model organism used to investigate the genetic bases of development and disease. There are Drosophila models for multiple neurodegenerative diseases, characterised by an increase in cell death. However, a fast, reliable, and accurate way to count the number of dying cells in vivo is not available. Here, we present a method based on image filtering and mathematical morphology techniques, to count automatically the number of dying cells in intact fruit-fly embryos. We call the resulting programme DeadEasy Caspase. It has been validated for Drosophila and we present examples of its power to address biological questions. Quantification is automatic, accurate, objective, and very fast. DeadEasy Caspase will be freely available as an ImageJ plug-in, and it can be modified for use in other sample types. It is of interest to the Drosophila and wider biomedical communities. DeadEasy Caspase is a powerful tool for the analysis of cell survival and cell death in development and in disease, such as neurodegenerative diseases and ageing. Combined with the power of Drosophila genetics, DeadEasy expands the tools that enable the use of Drosophila to analyse gene function, model disease and test drugs in the intact nervous system and whole animal.","bibo:AuthorList":["Forero, Manual G","Pennack, Jenny A.","Learte, Anabel R","Hidalgo, Alicia"],"dc:date":"2009-05-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48455,"sim:weight":0.332403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.330143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19304,"sim:weight":0.328813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.31765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43072,"sim:weight":0.31232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4881258,"sim:weight":0.305109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.303094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.303094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.303094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.303094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.303094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.303094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.303094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.303094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229128,"sim:weight":0.298886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.298514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.294274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5230396,"sim:weight":0.28848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.282168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

During the lytic cycle of EBV many viral proteins are expressed, potentially allowing virally infected cells to be recognized and eliminated by CD8+ T cells. We have recently identified an immune evasion protein encoded by EBV, BNLF2a, which is expressed in early phase lytic replication and inhibits peptide- and ATP-binding functions of the transporter associated with antigen processing. Ectopic expression of BNLF2a causes decreased surface MHC class I expression and inhibits the presentation of indicator antigens to CD8+ T cells. Here we sought to examine the influence of BNLF2a when expressed naturally during EBV lytic replication. We generated a BNLF2a-deleted recombinant EBV (ΔBNLF2a) and compared the ability of ΔBNLF2a and wild-type EBV-transformed B cell lines to be recognized by CD8+ T cell clones specific for EBV-encoded immediate early, early and late lytic antigens. Epitopes derived from immediate early and early expressed proteins were better recognized when presented by ΔBNLF2a transformed cells compared to wild-type virus transformants. However, recognition of late antigens by CD8+ T cells remained equally poor when presented by both wild-type and ΔBNLF2a cell targets. Analysis of BNLF2a and target protein expression kinetics showed that although BNLF2a is expressed during early phase replication, it is expressed at a time when there is an upregulation of immediate early proteins and initiation of early protein synthesis. Interestingly, BNLF2a protein expression was found to be lost by late lytic cycle yet ΔBNLF2a-transformed cells in late stage replication downregulated surface MHC class I to a similar extent as wild-type EBV-transformed cells. These data show that BNLF2a-mediated expression is stage-specific, affecting presentation of immediate early and early proteins, and that other evasion mechanisms operate later in the lytic cycle.","bibo:AuthorList":["Croft, Nathan P","Shannon-Lowe, Claire","Bell, Andrew I","Horst, Danielle","Kremmer, Elizabeth","Ressing, Maaike E","Wiertz, Emmanuel J.

A recent study identified the novel small molecule R406 as a selective inhibitor of Syk. Objectives: The present study evaluates the role of Syk in human platelets using the novel inhibitor R406. Methods: Agonist-induced GPVI and CLEC-2 signaling were assessed using aggregometry, immunoprecipitation and western blotting to determine the effects of R406 on platelet activation. Results: We demonstrate R406 to be a powerful inhibitor of Syk in human platelets. R406 abrogated shape change and aggregation induced by activation of GPVI and CLEC-2, and reduced platelet spreading on fibrinogen. The inhibitory effect of R406 was associated with inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins that lay downstream of Syk for all three receptors, including PLCc2.Strikingly, R406 markedly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2 and Syk downstream of CLEC-2 activation,whereas phosphorylation of Syk downstream of GPVI and integrin aIIbb3 was unaffected. Conclusions: The inhibitory effect of R406 provides direct evidence of a role for Syk in GPVI, CLEC-2 and integrin aIIbb3 signaling in human platelets. Further, the results demonstrate a critical role for Syk in mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of CLEC-2,suggesting a novel model in which both Src and Syk kinases mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of the C-type lectin receptor leading to platelet activation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spalton, Jennifer C.","Mori, Jun","Pollitt, A.Y","Hughes, C.E","Eble, Johannes A.","Watson, Steve P"],"dc:date":"2009-04-24","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19178,"sim:weight":0.704924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75810,"sim:weight":0.623953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19007,"sim:weight":0.617311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999570,"sim:weight":0.581824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19112,"sim:weight":0.53099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19237,"sim:weight":0.469471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76646,"sim:weight":0.428017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10907,"sim:weight":0.302611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76218,"sim:weight":0.239374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76526,"sim:weight":0.21898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76961,"sim:weight":0.211776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75424,"sim:weight":0.195027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.188232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.179899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75373,"sim:weight":0.179442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.17933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.179276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.175796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.160037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.157101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Cells are ovoid in shape with a single anterior flagellum encircled by a funnel-shaped collar of microvilli. Movement of the flagellum creates water currents from which food particles are entrapped on the outer surface of the collar and ingested by pseudopodia. One group of marine choanoflagellates has evolved an elaborate basket-like exoskeleton, the lorica, comprising two layers of siliceous costae made up of costal strips. A computer graphic model has been developed for generating three-dimensional images of choanoflagellate loricae based on a universal set of \u0027rules\u0027 derived from electron microscopical observations. This model has proved seminal in understanding how complex costal patterns can be assembled in a single continuous movement. The lorica, which provides a rigid framework around the cell, is multifunctional. It resists the locomotory forces generated by flagellar movement, directs and enhances water flow over the collar and, for planktonic species, contributes towards maintaining cells in suspension. Since the functional morphology of choanoflagellate cells is so effective and has been highly conserved within the group, the ecological and evolutionary radiation of choanoflagellates is almost entirely dependent on the ability of the external coverings, particularly the lorica, to diversify.","bibo:AuthorList":["Leadbeater, Barry S C","Yu, QiBin","Kent, Joyce","Stekel, Dov J"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.26412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.263832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.251465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.24748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.246951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.235601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.235601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.235601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.235601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.235601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.235601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.235601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.235601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.235601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.235601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.235601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.235601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.235601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.235601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108609,"sim:weight":0.2302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Errors in the initial direction and in the final finger position of this reach-to-target movement were significantly higher for cerebellar stimulation than they were in control conditions. The average directional errors in the cerebellar TMS condition were consistent with the reaching movements being planned and initiated from an estimated hand position that was 138 ms out of date. We suggest that these results demonstrate that the cerebellum is responsible for estimating the hand position over this time interval and that TMS disrupts this state estimate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miall, R.

The results show that although protein coverage was lower for LC-ECDMS/MS than for LC-CID-MS/MS, LC-ECD-MS/MS resulted in longer peptide sequence tags,providing greater confidence in protein assignment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Creese, Andrew J.","Cooper, Helen J."],"dc:date":"2007-03-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19249,"sim:weight":0.749326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19299,"sim:weight":0.684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19301,"sim:weight":0.68203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9052205,"sim:weight":0.668358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19175,"sim:weight":0.661064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19198,"sim:weight":0.583946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19039,"sim:weight":0.571912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19003,"sim:weight":0.5055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19300,"sim:weight":0.477047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19123,"sim:weight":0.45486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46868,"sim:weight":0.438027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25860,"sim:weight":0.416154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":692523,"sim:weight":0.403363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19135,"sim:weight":0.361597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12349,"sim:weight":0.35046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46534,"sim:weight":0.34745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45281,"sim:weight":0.30548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931159,"sim:weight":0.300864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46535,"sim:weight":0.288481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19136,"sim:weight":0.28699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This model can be used to analyze the cellular and molecular requirements for the development and organization of splenic microenvironments.Whole embryonic day 15 (ED15) spleens, grafted under the kidney capsule of adult mice, were colonized by host-derived lymphocytes and DC and developed normal splenic architecture. Grafts were also able to form germinal centers in response to T-dependent antigen. Using this system we demonstrated that adult host-derived lymphotoxin (LT) a was sufficient for the development of ED15 LTa/ grafts. Grafting of ED15 LTa/ spleens into RAG/ hosts followed by transfer of LT a/ splenocytes revealed no requirement for lymphocyte-derived LT a in the induction of CCL21 or the development of T-zone stroma. These data suggest that interactions between adult lymphoid-tissue inducer-like cells and embryonic stromal cells initiated T-zone development. Furthermore,adult lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells were shown to develop from bone marrow-derived progenitors. The model described here demonstrates a method of transferring whole splenic microenvironments and dissecting the stromal and hematopoietic signals involved in spleen development and organization.","bibo:AuthorList":["Glanville, S.H","Bekiaris, V","Jenkinson, E.J","Lane, P.J.L","Anderson, Graham","Withers, D.R"],"dc:date":"2009-12-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":76969,"sim:weight":0.461293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269992,"sim:weight":0.400529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26476,"sim:weight":0.367124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4873384,"sim:weight":0.292746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145503,"sim:weight":0.28869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.280031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.277482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.261051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.260756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.260177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.233819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.232065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269995,"sim:weight":0.230533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98849,"sim:weight":0.229715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.221028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27251,"sim:weight":0.216844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43460,"sim:weight":0.215452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48455,"sim:weight":0.208247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98615,"sim:weight":0.203826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585831,"sim:weight":0.19112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Pups were born into normal room air and weaned normally. At 10 weeks of age, hearts were excised under anaesthesia and underwent retrograde \u0027Langendorff\u0027 perfusion. Mechanical performance was measured at constant filling pressure (100 cm H2O) with intraventricular balloon. Left ventricular free wall was dissected away and capillary density estimated following alkaline phosphatase staining. Expression of SERCA2a and Nitric Oxide Synthases (NOS) proteins were estimated by immunoblotting. \n \nResults: CHU significantly increased body mass (P \u003c 0.001) compared with age-matched control rats but was without effect on relative cardiac mass. For incremental increases in left ventricular balloon volume, diastolic pressure was preserved. However, systolic pressure was significantly greater following CHU for balloon volume \u003d 50 μl (P \u003c 0.01) and up to 200 μl (P \u003c 0.05). For higher balloon volumes systolic pressure was not significantly different from control.

Western blot analysis revealed no change to the expression of SERCA2a or nNOS but immuno-detectable eNOS protein was significantly decreased (P \u003c 0.001) in cardiac tissue following chronic hypoxia in utero. \n \nConclusion: These data offer potential mechanisms for poor recovery following ischaemia, including decreased coronary flow reserve and impaired angiogenesis with subsequent detrimental effects of post-natal cardiac performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hauton, David","Ousley, Victoria"],"dc:date":"2009-01-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25854,"sim:weight":0.363077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107063,"sim:weight":0.268557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76135,"sim:weight":0.249313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.248727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.217318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26719,"sim:weight":0.214801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387191,"sim:weight":0.21291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.210428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98931,"sim:weight":0.201301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.193056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.191359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.189584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99270,"sim:weight":0.187412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19191,"sim:weight":0.175351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18039,"sim:weight":0.172983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48931,"sim:weight":0.170242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99402,"sim:weight":0.167771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.166111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386803,"sim:weight":0.163378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.159687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Recent evidence indicates that an important component of the persistence strategy involves active interference with the MHC class I antigen processing pathway during the lytic replication cycle. We have now identified a novel role for the lytic cycle gene, BILF1, which encodes a glycoprotein with the properties of a constitutive signaling G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). BILF1 reduced the levels of MHC class I at the cell surface and inhibited CD8+ T cell recognition of \nendogenous target antigens. The underlying mechanism involves physical association of BILF1 with MHC class I molecules, an increased turnover from the cell surface, and enhanced degradation via lysosomal proteases. The BILF1 protein of the closely related CeHV15 c1-herpesvirus of the Rhesus Old World primate (80% amino acid sequence identity) downregulated surface MHC class I similarly to EBV BILF1. Amongst the human herpesviruses, the GPCR encoded by the ORF74 of the KSHV c2-herpesvirus is most closely related to EBV BILF1 (15% amino acid sequence identity) but did not affect levels of surface MHC class I. An engineered mutant of BILF1 that was unable to activate G protein signaling pathways retained the ability to downregulate MHC class I, indicating that the immune-modulating and GPCR-signaling properties are two distinct functions of BILF1. These findings extend our understanding of the normal biology of an important human pathogen. The discovery of a third EBV lytic cycle gene that cooperates to interfere with MHC class I antigen processing underscores the importance of the need for EBV to be able to evade CD8+ T cell responses during the lytic replication cycle, at a time when such a large number of potential viral targets are expressed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zuo, Jianmin","Currin, Andrew","Griffin, Bryan D","Shannon-Lowe, Claire","Thomas, Wendy A","Ressing, Maaike E","Wiertz, Emmanuel J.

It is compact with low dispersion and low loss. The design has been extensively tested using a prototype filter micromachined using laser drilling on a copper sheet and the results show a good agreement with the theoretical calculations. The laser fabrication has exposed weakness in suitability to volume production, uneven edges and oxide residuals on the edges, which affects the filter performance. A process \r\nfor fabrication of such a filter in SU-8 has been developed which is based on a UV lithographical process. In order to fabricate such thick SU-8 layers, the SU-8 process has been optimized in terms of UV radiation and post exposure baking. During the test fabrication, the optimized SU-8 process has produced microstructures with an aspect ratio of 40:1 and a sidewall of 90 ± 0.1◦. The high quality SU-8 structures can be then either coated with a conductive metal or used as moulds for producing copper structures using an electroforming process. The microfabrication process presented in this paper suits the proposed filter well. It also reveals a good potential for volume production of high quality RF devices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jiang, K","Lancaster, M.J.","Llamas-Garro, I","Jin, P"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19248,"sim:weight":0.589642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101536,"sim:weight":0.383955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146058,"sim:weight":0.364561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109133,"sim:weight":0.363939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108948,"sim:weight":0.34635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45684,"sim:weight":0.335744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.333541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26620,"sim:weight":0.330397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19233,"sim:weight":0.32962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154188,"sim:weight":0.329171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512823,"sim:weight":0.32658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769022,"sim:weight":0.307651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154453,"sim:weight":0.298196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352037,"sim:weight":0.293325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46778,"sim:weight":0.288559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47233,"sim:weight":0.285525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154454,"sim:weight":0.284182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1630054,"sim:weight":0.284013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270720,"sim:weight":0.279361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24121,"sim:weight":0.27539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Groucho/TLE family of co-repressor proteins also regulate development and modulate the activity of many DNA-binding transcription factors during a range of diverse cellular processes including haematopoiesis. We have shown previously that PRH is a repressor of transcription in haematopoietic cells and that an Eh-1 motif present within the N-terminal transcription repression domain of PRH mediates binding to Groucho/TLE proteins and enables co-repression. Here we demonstrate that PRH regulates the nuclear retention of TLE proteins during cellular fractionation. We show that transcriptional repression and the nuclear retention of TLE proteins requires PRH to bind to both TLE and DNA. In addition, we characterise a trans-dominant negative PRH protein that inhibits wild type PRH activity by sequestering TLE proteins to specific sub-nuclear domains. These results demonstrate that transcriptional repression by PRH is dependent on TLE availability and suggest that sub-nuclear localisation of TLE plays an important role in transcriptional repression by PRH.","bibo:AuthorList":["Desjobert, Cecile","Noy, Peter","Swingler, Tracey","Williams, Hannah","Gaston, Kevin","Jayaraman, Padma-Sheela"],"dc:date":"2008-08-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45616,"sim:weight":0.116581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.112016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48455,"sim:weight":0.107644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44196,"sim:weight":0.105874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98668,"sim:weight":0.105151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.104953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269995,"sim:weight":0.10147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384092,"sim:weight":0.100843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46577,"sim:weight":0.100748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98670,"sim:weight":0.100411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.0998906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46540,"sim:weight":0.0961016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573524,"sim:weight":0.094998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.0925998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.0900828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46581,"sim:weight":0.0888232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98669,"sim:weight":0.0811676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381877,"sim:weight":0.0726743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45573,"sim:weight":0.0615404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":336873,"sim:weight":0.0600793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This requirement is essential for instruments in which the infrared laser is angled off-axis, such as the Thermo Finnigan LTQ FT. Generally, the electron irradiation time required for proteins is much shorter (ms) than that required for peptides (tens of ms), and the modulation of ECD, AI ECD, and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) with ion magnetron motion is more pronounced. We have optimized AI ECD for ubiquitin, cytochrome c, and myoglobin; however the results can be extended to other proteins. We demonstrate that pre-ECD and post-ECD activation are physically different and display different kinetics. We also demonstrate how, by use of appropriate AI ECD time sequences and normalization, the kinetics of protein gas-phase refolding can be deconvoluted from the diffusion of the ion cloud and measured on the time scale longer than the period of ion magnetron motion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mikhailov, Victor A.","Cooper, Helen J."],"dc:date":"2008-12-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19175,"sim:weight":0.712945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19279,"sim:weight":0.684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19123,"sim:weight":0.621304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19003,"sim:weight":0.597841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19249,"sim:weight":0.594287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19039,"sim:weight":0.588548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19198,"sim:weight":0.557291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19301,"sim:weight":0.543128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19300,"sim:weight":0.439514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19135,"sim:weight":0.2951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46868,"sim:weight":0.29188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45281,"sim:weight":0.285999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76605,"sim:weight":0.279815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12349,"sim:weight":0.269125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46534,"sim:weight":0.256511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45731,"sim:weight":0.24545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77875,"sim:weight":0.244956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19308,"sim:weight":0.241374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19136,"sim:weight":0.235443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46535,"sim:weight":0.229584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here we report an optimized strategy for wide-scan DI nESI FT-ICR MS that increases dynamic range but maintains high mass accuracy. It comprises the collection if multiple adjacent selected ion monitoring (SIM) windows that are stitched together using novel algorithms. The final SIM-stitching method, derived from several optimization experiments, comprises 21 adjoining SIM windows each of width m/z 30 (from m/z 70 to 500; adjacent windows overlap by m/z 10) with an automated gain control (AGC) target of 1 105 charges. SIMstitching and wide-scan range (WSR; Thermo Electron)were compared using a defined standard to assess mass accuracy and a liver extract to assess peak count and dynamic range. SIM-stitching decreased the maximum mass error by 1.3- and 4.3-fold, and increased the peak count by 5.3- and 1.8-fold, versus WSR (AGC targets of 1 x 105 and 5 x 105, respectively). SIM-stitching achieved an rms mass error of 0.18 ppm and detected over 3000 peaks in liver extract.

Neurotrophins are the main vertebrate secreted signalling molecules that link nervous system structure and function: they regulate \nneuronal survival, targeting, synaptic plasticity, memory and cognition. We have identified a neurotrophic factor in \nflies, Drosophila Neurotrophin (DNT1), structurally related to all known neurotrophins and highly conserved in insects.By investigating with genetics the consequences of removing DNT1 or adding it in excess, we show that DNT1 \nmaintains neuronal survival, as more neurons die in DNT1 mutants and expression of DNT1 rescues naturally occurring \ncell death, and it enables targeting by motor neurons. We show that Spa¨ tzle and a further fly neurotrophin superfamily member, DNT2, also have neurotrophic functions in flies. Our findings imply that most likely a neurotrophin was present in the common ancestor of all bilateral organisms, giving rise to invertebrate and vertebrate neurotrophins through gene or whole-genome duplications. This work provides a missing link between aspects of neuronal function in flies and vertebrates, and it opens the opportunity to use Drosophila to investigate further aspects of neurotrophin function and to model related diseases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhu, Bangfu","Pennack, Jenny A.","McQuilton, Peter","Forero, Manuel G.","Mizuguch, Kenji","Sutcliffe, Ben","Gu, Chun-Jing","Fenton, Janine C.","Hidalgo, Alicia"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4877226,"sim:weight":0.500636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4881258,"sim:weight":0.473871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4892548,"sim:weight":0.441719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4868987,"sim:weight":0.39864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154341,"sim:weight":0.361266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4882763,"sim:weight":0.332586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46577,"sim:weight":0.328951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19259,"sim:weight":0.328813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4872968,"sim:weight":0.322762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":537690,"sim:weight":0.312679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49697,"sim:weight":0.306489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4879593,"sim:weight":0.305015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.29386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":501129,"sim:weight":0.291725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222982,"sim:weight":0.291303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154406,"sim:weight":0.286076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1078598,"sim:weight":0.283593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154246,"sim:weight":0.283588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4886525,"sim:weight":0.281489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.278423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At a pre-receptor level, 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11b-HSD1) activates cortisol from cortisone locally within adipose tissue, and inhibition of 11b-HSD1 in liver and adipose tissue has been proposed as a novel therapy to treat MS by reducing hepatic glucose output and adiposity. Using a transformed human subcutaneous preadipocyte cell line (Chub-S7) and human primary preadipocytes, we have defined the role of glucocorticoids and 11b-HSD1 in regulating adipose tissue differentiation. Human cells were differentiated with 1.0 mM cortisol (F), or cortisone (E) with or without 100 nM of a highly selective 11b-HSD1 inhibitor PF-877423. 11b-HSD1 mRNA expression increased across adipocyte differentiation (P!0.001, nZ4), which was paralleled by an increase in 11b-HSD1 oxo-reductase activity (from nil on day 0 to 5.9G1.9 pmol/mg per h on day 16,P!0.01, nZ7). Cortisone enhanced adipocyte differentiation; fatty acid-binding protein 4 expression increased 312-fold (P!0.001) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 47-fold (P!0.001) versus controls. This was abolished by co-incubation with PF-877423. In addition, cellular lipid content decreased significantly. These findings were confirmed in the primary cultures of human subcutaneous preadipocytes. The increase in 11b-HSD1 mRNA expression and activity is essential for the induction of human adipogenesis. Blocking adipogenesis with a novel and specific 11b-HSD1 inhibitor may represent a novel approach to treat obesity in patients with MS.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bujalska, I.J","Gathercole, L.L","Tomlinson, J W","Darimont, C","Ermolieff, J","Fanjul, A.N","Rejto, P.A","Stewart, P M"],"dc:date":"2008-03-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75820,"sim:weight":0.744476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76548,"sim:weight":0.654513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631291,"sim:weight":0.510945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76149,"sim:weight":0.463163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76066,"sim:weight":0.457398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99270,"sim:weight":0.444945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.436132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387047,"sim:weight":0.373808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387223,"sim:weight":0.362848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99402,"sim:weight":0.344579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387156,"sim:weight":0.327074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98986,"sim:weight":0.323489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387159,"sim:weight":0.319482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76351,"sim:weight":0.314923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387126,"sim:weight":0.310809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386803,"sim:weight":0.306118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26719,"sim:weight":0.301993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.300838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.293797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.291788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A bioinformatics approach identified putative integral membrane proteins, MSMEG2785 in Mycobacterium smegmatis, Rv2673 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and NCgl1822 in Corynebacterium glutamicum, with 10 predicted transmembrane \ndomains and a glycosyltransferase motif (DDX), features that are common to the GT-C superfamily of glycosyltransferases. Deletion of M. smegmatis SMEG2785 resulted in altered growth and glycosyl linkage analysis revealed the absence of AG a(1,3)-linked arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues. Complementation of the M. smegmatis deletion mutant was fully restored to a wild-type phenotype by MSMEG2785 and Rv2673, and as a result, we have now termed this previously uncharacterized open reading frame, arabinofuranosyltransferase C (aftC). Enzyme assays using the sugar donor b-D-arabinofuranosyl-1- \nmonophosphoryl-decaprenol (DPA) and a newly synthesized linear a(1,5)-linked Ara5 neoglycolipid acceptor together with chemical identification of products formed, clearly identified AftC as a branching a(1,3) arabinofuranosyltransferase.

NAS-91 analogues with ortho-modifications gave enhanced whole-cell ctivity. However, extension with biphenyl modifications compromised the whole-cell activities of both NAS-21 and NAS-91 analogues. Interestingly, both libraries demonstrated in vitro activity against fatty acid synthase II (FAS-II) but not FAS-I in cell-free extracts. In in vitro assays of FAS-II inhibition, NAS-21 analogues 4 and 5 had IC50 values of 28 and 19 mg ml”1, respectively, for the control M. bovis strain, and the M. bovis BCG strain overexpressing Rv0636 showed a marked increase in resistance.

Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and mycolic acid methyl ester (MAME)analysis of M. bovis BCG and the Rv0636-overexpressing strain revealed that the effect of the drug was relieved in the overexpressing strain, further implicating and potentially identifying Rv0636 as the target for these known FabZ dehydratase inhibitors.

Previously, we have shown that electrooxidation with nitrite is a rapid method for the selective nitration of tyrosine residues in proteins. In principle, it should be possible to substitute a number of electrooxidisable anions into the tyrosine phenol ring. Electrochemical iodination is more difficult to control than nitration because the rapid anodic oxidation of I− leads to persistent formation of the iodinating triiodide anion. However, application of pulsed electrooxidation and reduction cycles is shown to be an effective procedure for the selective mono and double-iodination of myoglobin, which may have general application to other proteins in \ncontrolling of the level of iodination. Mono- and double-iodination of myoglobin by this method was confirmed by electrospray FT-ICR mass spectrometry. Infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) enabled localization of the site of mono-iodination to be restricted to either His97 or Tyr103. More extensive sequence coverage was obtained with electron capture dissociation (ECD), allowing unambiguous assignment of the site of iodination to Tyr103.","bibo:AuthorList":["Iniesta, Jesus","Cooper, Helen J.","Marshall, Alan G.","Heptinstall, John","Walton, David J.","Peterson, Ian R."],"dc:date":"2008-06-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45281,"sim:weight":0.289596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46868,"sim:weight":0.275826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3158,"sim:weight":0.248944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84831,"sim:weight":0.245151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19299,"sim:weight":0.241374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46535,"sim:weight":0.238578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47635,"sim:weight":0.235832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44440,"sim:weight":0.233488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.22532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19003,"sim:weight":0.224029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.221728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45731,"sim:weight":0.215005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.21323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102623,"sim:weight":0.200895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45642,"sim:weight":0.2008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19175,"sim:weight":0.200226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44827,"sim:weight":0.197897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101346,"sim:weight":0.195244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101264,"sim:weight":0.19321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19279,"sim:weight":0.190415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Its principle contribution is a modular language for configuring systems. A configuration is a description in the new language of how a system is constructed hierarchically from specifications of its component parts. Category theory has been used to represent the composition of specifications that share a component part by constructing colimits of diagrams. We reformulated this application of category theory to view both configured specifications and their diagrams as algebraic presentations of presheaves. The framework of presheaves leads naturally to a configuration language that expresses structuring from instances of specifications, and also incorporates a new notion of instance reduction to extract the component instances from a particular configuration. The language now expresses the hierarchical structuring of multi-level configured specifications. The syntax is simple because it is independent of any specification language; structuring a diagram to represent a configuration is simple because there is no need to calculate a colimit; and combining specifications is simple because structuring is by configuration morphisms with no need to flatten either specifications or their diagrams to calculate colimits.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hill, Gillian","Vickers, Steven"],"dc:date":"2005-12-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.284428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99029,"sim:weight":0.279676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98829,"sim:weight":0.255998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386777,"sim:weight":0.254774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101552,"sim:weight":0.247581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573418,"sim:weight":0.245478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393453,"sim:weight":0.245457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.240306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999162,"sim:weight":0.232255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934327,"sim:weight":0.20229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99157,"sim:weight":0.200596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934392,"sim:weight":0.196801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934405,"sim:weight":0.176906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933370,"sim:weight":0.176906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931886,"sim:weight":0.155839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933996,"sim:weight":0.122211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934348,"sim:weight":0.122183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932650,"sim:weight":0.0981509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19262,"sim:weight":0.0923318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103714,"sim:weight":0.0864145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We then tested for the transfer of the dynamic motion aftereffect (dMAE) between the three cues, matched for visibility. Observers adapted to moving, 0.5-c/deg horizontal modulations for 2 min (with 10 s top-ups). Relatively strong dMAEs were found when the \nadaptation and test patterns were defined by the same cue (i.e., both LM, both CM, or both OM); these effects were tuned for spatial frequency in the case of LM and CM. There was a partial transfer of the dMAE from LM to CM and OM; this transferred effect seemed to lose its tuning. The aftereffect transferred well from CM to OM and retained its tuning. There was little or no transfer from CM to LM or from OM to CM or LM. This asymmetric transfer of the dMAE between first- and second-order cues and between the second-order cues suggests some degree of separation between the mechanisms that process them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schofield, Andrew J.","Ledgeway, Timothy","Hutchinson, Claire V."],"dc:date":"2007-06-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52289,"sim:weight":0.492794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.492794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.485988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.482709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52298,"sim:weight":0.481409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52302,"sim:weight":0.481409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.448932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52305,"sim:weight":0.445835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52378,"sim:weight":0.445835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102678,"sim:weight":0.385148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98979,"sim:weight":0.361003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85172,"sim:weight":0.34051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98778,"sim:weight":0.325413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28131,"sim:weight":0.312515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98981,"sim:weight":0.311852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85026,"sim:weight":0.311699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767749,"sim:weight":0.307961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98622,"sim:weight":0.29464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154289,"sim:weight":0.294605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28130,"sim:weight":0.281448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This problem has particular importance because mutations in ROR2 are associated with two human skeletal dysmorphology syndromes, recessive Robinow Syndrome (RS) and dominant acting Brachydactyly type B (BDB). Here we show, using a constitutive dimerisation approach, that ROR2 exhibits dimerisation-induced tyrosine kinase activity and the ROR2 C-terminal domain, which is deleted in BDB, is required for recruitment and activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src. Native ROR2 phosphorylation is induced by the ligand Wnt5a and is blocked by pharmacological inhibition of Src kinase activity. Eight sites of Src-mediated ROR2 phosphorylation have been identified by mass spectrometry. Activation via tyrosine phosphorylation of ROR2 receptor leads to its internalisation into Rab5 positive endosomes. These findings show that BDB mutant receptors are defective in kinase activation as a result of failure to recruit Src.","bibo:AuthorList":["Akbarzadeh, Shiva","Wheldon, Lee M","Sweet, Steve M.

Using RT-PCR we compared expression of Il1a, Il1b, Il1rn, Il1r1, and Il1r2 during the pre- and peri-implantation periods of pregnancy in wild-type (WT) and LIF-null LE and stroma. In WT LE, Il1a transcripts were down-regulated on Day 4 of pregnancy (D4), with renewed expression by the evening of D4 (D4 pm). In Lif−/− LE there was a gradual decrease in expression on D2, and expression became undetectable by D6. Il1b and Il1r1 expression were similar in WT and null mice, but Il1rn expression was almost completely lost during the peri-implantation period in Lif−/− LE. In the stroma, Il1a was sharply down-regulated on D4 and reappeared on D4 pm but was only expressed from D3 to D5 in the null mice. Stromal Il1r1 and Il1r2 were also misregulated. Il1rn showed constitutive expression in null stroma in contrast to the loss of expression on D4 in the WT mouse. In Lif-deficient mice, immunostaining indicated a reduction of endometrial IL1A at the time of implantation and of IL1B in stroma. LE-stromal coculture revealed that LIF stimulated the apical secretion of both IL1A and PTGES2 by LE cells without affecting basal secretion of IL1A and with only a small effect on basal PTGES2 secretion. We conclude that Il1a and Il1rn in LE and Il1a, Il1rn, and Il1r1 in stroma are regulated by LIF, which stimulates apical secretion of IL1A by LE.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heath, John K"],"dc:date":"2008-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1029217,"sim:weight":0.434717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.256291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.224623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.2236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.217635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.209374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98849,"sim:weight":0.191707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.190354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98986,"sim:weight":0.188392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.188018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98615,"sim:weight":0.186091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386784,"sim:weight":0.185812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.176915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.176854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.174183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25906,"sim:weight":0.16588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44075,"sim:weight":0.163581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931557,"sim:weight":0.161813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23815,"sim:weight":0.159893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387159,"sim:weight":0.158451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We argue at length that an arrow of complexity does indeed occur in evolution, which can be most reasonably interpreted as the result of a passive trend rather than a driven one. What, then, is the role of evolution in the creation of this trend, and under which conditions will it emerge? In the later sections of this article we point out that when certain proper conditions (which we attempt to formulate in a concise form) are met, Darwinian evolution predictably creates a sustained trend of increase in maximum complexity (that is, an arrow of complexity) that would not be possible without it; but if they are not, evolution will not only fail to produce an arrow of complexity, but may actually prevent any increase in complexity altogether.

Complementary in vitro binding assays showed high-affinity RutR binding to 16 of the 20 targets, with the four low-affinity RutR targets lacking predicted key binding determinants. Surprisingly, most of the DNA targets for RutR are located within coding segments of the genome and appear to have little or no effect on transcript levels in the conditions tested. This contrasts sharply with other E. coli transcription factors whose binding sites are primarily located in intergenic regions. We suggest that either RutR has yet undiscovered function or that evolution has been slow to eliminate non-functional DNA sites for RutR because they do not have an adverse effect on cell fitness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shimada, Tomohiro","Ishihama, Akira","Busby, Stephen J.

Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by measuring agreement of the index test with two other assays (TruCount and FACSCount). Clinical utility was investigated by comparing CD4 counts with the new assay with WHO clinical staging in patients with HIV. \n \nSetting : Research laboratories and antiretroviral therapy clinic at a medical school and large government hospital in southern Malawi. \n \nParticipants : Assay comparisons were performed on consecutive blood samples sent for CD4 counting from 129 patients with HIV. Comparison of CD4 count with staging was conducted on 253 consecutive new patients attending the antiretroviral therapy clinic. \n \nMain outcome measures : Limits of agreement with 95% confidence intervals between index test and reference standards. \n \nResults : The limits of agreement for Blantyre count and TruCount were excellent (cell count −48.9 to 27.0 cells/μl for absolute counts in the CD4 range \u003c400 cells/μl and −2.42% to 2.37% for CD4 percentage). The assay was affordable with reagent costs per test of $0.44 (£0.22, €0.33) for both absolute count and CD4 percentage, and $0.11 for CD4 percentage alone. Of 193 patients with clinical stage I or II disease, who were ineligible for antiretroviral therapy by clinical staging criteria, 73 38%) had CD4 counts \u003c200 cells/μl. By contrast, 12 (20%) of 60 patients with stage III or IV disease had CD4 counts \u003e350 cells/μl. \n \nConclusions : This simplified method of counting CD4 cells with flow cytometry has good agreement with established commercial assays, is affordable for routine clinical use in Africa, and could improve clinical decision making in patients with HIV.","bibo:AuthorList":["MacLennan, Calman A.","Liu, Michael K P","White, Sarah A.","Oosterhout, Joep J G van","Simukonda, Felanji","Bwanali, Joseph","Moore, Michael J","Zijlstra, Eduard E","Drayson, Mark T.","Molyneux, Malcolm E."],"dc:date":"2007-07-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27251,"sim:weight":0.270392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.183222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22728,"sim:weight":0.169436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.159597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26488,"sim:weight":0.154382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.152491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.150291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.139985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.139091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.136602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.130209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.127808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29886,"sim:weight":0.113304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.108544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.102481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47263,"sim:weight":0.0895544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23872,"sim:weight":0.0802165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26486,"sim:weight":0.0802165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25868,"sim:weight":0.0780457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43460,"sim:weight":0.0710751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Both thrombocytopenia and platelet-inducedPRBCclumping are associated with severe malaria and, especially, withCM.In the present study, we investigated the occurrence of the clumping phenomenon in patients with CM by isolating and coincubating their plasma and PRBCs ex vivo. Malawian children with CM all had low platelet counts, with the degree of thrombocytopenia directly proportional to the density of parasitemia. Plasma samples obtained from these patients subsequently induced weak PRBC clumping. When the assays were repeated, with the plasma platelet concentrations adjusted to within the physiological range considered to be normal, massive clumping occurred. The results of this study suggest that thrombocytopenia may, through reduction of platelet-mediated clumping of PRBCs, provide a protective mechanism for the host during CM.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wassmer, Samuel C","Taylor, Terrie","MacLennan, Calman A.","Kanjala, Maxwell","Mukaka, Mavuto","Molyneux, Malcolm E.","Grau, Georges Emile"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1001851,"sim:weight":0.399832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26480,"sim:weight":0.325783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.281935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75685,"sim:weight":0.238555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.230005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1439066,"sim:weight":0.227629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.211087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.204512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.203284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26781,"sim:weight":0.201534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26717,"sim:weight":0.200917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76662,"sim:weight":0.199804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631497,"sim:weight":0.198277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98860,"sim:weight":0.197527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76079,"sim:weight":0.192333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.189435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75799,"sim:weight":0.187094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101909,"sim:weight":0.177683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.176146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23977,"sim:weight":0.175851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For instance, ethambutol targets arabinogalactan biosynthesis through inhibition of the arabinofuranosyltransferases Mt-EmbA and Mt-EmbB. A bioinformatics approach identified putative integral membrane proteins, MSMEG2785 in Mycobacterium smegmatis, Rv2673 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and NCgl1822 in Corynebacterium glutamicum, with 10 predicted transmembrane domains and a glycosyltransferase motif (DDX), features that are common to the GT-C superfamily of glycosyltransferases. Deletion of M. smegmatis MSMEG2785 resulted in altered growth and glycosyl linkage analysis revealed the absence of AG (13)-linked arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues. Complementation of the M. smegmatis deletion mutant was fully restored to a wild type phenotype by MSMEG2785 and Rv2673, and as a result, we have now termed this previously uncharacterized open reading frame, arabinofuranosyltransferase C (aftC). Enzyme assays using the sugar donor -D-arabinofuranosyl-1-monophosphoryldecaprenol (DPA) and a newly synthesized linear (15)-linked Ara5 neoglycolipid acceptor together with chemical identification of products formed, clearly identified AftC as a branching (13) arabinofuranosyltransferase. This newly discovered glycosyltransferase sheds further light on the complexities of Mycobacterium cell wall biosynthesis, such as in M. tuberculosis and related species and represents a potential new drug target.","bibo:AuthorList":["Birch, Helen","Alderwick, Luke J.","Bhatt, Apoorva","Rittmann, Doris","Krumbach, Karin","Singh, Albel","Bai, Yu","Lowary, Todd L.","Eggeling, Lothar","Besra, Gurdyal S"],"dc:date":"2008-05-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75329,"sim:weight":0.807838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75896,"sim:weight":0.633671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76854,"sim:weight":0.558351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19277,"sim:weight":0.544114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76172,"sim:weight":0.475602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19201,"sim:weight":0.472115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631274,"sim:weight":0.45625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44252,"sim:weight":0.341479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19307,"sim:weight":0.335758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19006,"sim:weight":0.328091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.327641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.31864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.304844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101609,"sim:weight":0.299208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585857,"sim:weight":0.292672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.290758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45241,"sim:weight":0.284073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.283172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.282741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709941,"sim:weight":0.278578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Cellmediated \nimmune responses control intracellular infection, but they do not protect against extracellular growth of NTS in the blood. We investigated whether antibody protects against NTS bacteremia in Malawian children, because we found this condition mainly occurs before 2 years of age, with relative sparing of infants younger than 4 months old. Sera from all healthy Malawian children tested aged more than 16 months contained anti-Salmonella antibody and successfully killed NTS. Killing was mediated by complement membrane attack complex and not augmented in the presence of blood leukocytes. Sera from most healthy children less than 16 months old lacked NTS-specific antibody, and sera lacking antibody did not kill NTS despite normal complement function. Addition of Salmonella-specific antibody, but not mannose-binding lectin, enabled NTS killing. All NTS strains tested had long-chain lipopolysaccharide and the rck gene, features that resist direct complement-mediated killing. Disruption of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis enabled killing of NTS by serum lacking Salmonella-specific antibody. We conclude that Salmonella-specific antibody that overcomes the complement resistance of NTS develops by 2 years of life in Malawian children. This finding and the age-incidence of NTS bacteremia suggest that antibody protects against NTS bacteremia and support the development of vaccines against NTS that induce protective antibody.","bibo:AuthorList":["MacLennan, Calman A.","Gondwe, Esther N.","Msefula, Chisomo L.","Kingsley, Robert A.","Thomson, Nicholas R.","White, Sarah A.","Goodall, Margaret","Pickard, Derek J.","Graham, Stephen M.","Dougan, Gordon","Hart, C.

Patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke who had a close carer were assigned to receive family support or normal care. Families were visited at home by a researcher 12 months after the stroke, and a series of questionnaires was administered to patient and carer. \n \nResults: The benefits to carers mostly persisted, though they were no longer statistically significant because some patients were lost to follow up.

The service usually maintains contact with a family for a year, and some patients spend a significant proportion of the first six months in hospital, during which time family support might be anticipated to have less impact.

Patients in the control group received usual care (blood pressure monitoring by their practice). \r\nMain outcome measures: Primary outcome: change in systolic blood pressure at six months and one year in both intervention and control groups. Secondary outcomes: change in health behaviours, anxiety, prescribed antihypertensive drugs, patients’ preferences of method of blood pressure monitoring, and costs. \r\nResults: 400 (91%) patients attended follow up at one year. Systolic blood pressure in the intervention group had significantly reduced after six months (mean difference 4.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 0.8 mm Hg to 7.9 mm Hg)) but not after one year (mean difference 2.7 mm Hg (-1.2 mm Hg to 6.6 mm Hg)). No overall difference was found in diastolic blood pressure, anxiety, health behaviours, or number of prescribed drugs. Patients who self monitored lost more weight than controls (as evidenced by a drop in body mass index), rated self monitoring above monitoring by a doctor or nurse, and consulted less often. Overall, self monitoring did not cost significantly more than usual care (£251 ($437; 364 euros) (95% confidence interval £233 to £275) versus £240 (£217 to £263). \r\nConclusions: Practice based self monitoring resulted in small but significant improvements of blood pressure at six months, which were not sustained after a year. Self monitoring was well received by patients, anxiety did not increase, and there was no appreciable additional cost. Practice based self monitoring is feasible and results in blood pressure control that is similar to that in usual care.","bibo:AuthorList":["McManus, R.J.","Mant, J.W.F.","Roalfe, A.","Oakes, R.A.","Bryan, S.","Pattison, H.M.","Hobbs, F.D.R."],"dc:date":"2005-08-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19331,"sim:weight":0.470939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.417527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.406375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49282,"sim:weight":0.350451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.320778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.306581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.304373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102958,"sim:weight":0.302138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.299391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.299391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.297935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43411,"sim:weight":0.272884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.267526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.264357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.262843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.240104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.229646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19333,"sim:weight":0.217186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17910,"sim:weight":0.206185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50819,"sim:weight":0.195309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Many genes in the CRP regulon have been predicted simply based on the presence of DNA-binding sites within gene promoters. In this study, we have exploited a newly developed technique, run-off transcription/microarray analysis (ROMA) to define CRP-regulated promoters. Using ROMA, we identified 176 operons that were activated by CRP in vitro and 16 operons that were repressed. Using positive control mutants in different regions of CRP, we were able to classify the different promoters into class I or class II/III. A total of 104 operons were predicted to contain Class II CRP-binding sites. Sequence analysis of the operons that were repressed by CRP revealed different mechanisms for CRP inhibition. In contrast, the in vivo transcriptional profiles failed to identify most CRP-dependent regulation because of the complexity of the regulatory network. Analysis of these operons supports the hypothesis that CRP is not only a regulator of genes required for catabolism of sugars other than glucose, but also regulates the expression of a large number of other genes in E.coli.

They are generally regarded as visually-guided, pursuit-dive foragers, so it would be expected that cormorants have excellent vision much like aerial predators, such as hawks which detect and pursue prey from a distance. Indeed cormorant eyes appear to show some specific adaptations to the amphibious life style. They are reported to have a highly pliable lens and powerful intraocular muscles which are thought to accommodate for the loss of corneal refractive power that accompanies immersion and ensures a well focussed image on the retina. However, nothing is known of the visual performance of these birds and how this might influence their prey capture technique. \n \nMethodology/Principal Findings \nWe measured the aquatic visual acuity of great cormorants under a range of viewing conditions (illuminance, target contrast, viewing distance) and found it to be unexpectedly poor. Cormorant visual acuity under a range of viewing conditions is in fact comparable to unaided humans under water, and very inferior to that of aerial predators. We present a prey detectability model based upon the known acuity of cormorants at different illuminances, target contrasts and viewing distances. This shows that cormorants are able to detect individual prey only at close range (less than 1 m). \n \nConclusions/Significance \nWe conclude that cormorants are not the aquatic equivalent of hawks. Their efficient hunting involves the use of specialised foraging techniques which employ brief short-distance pursuit and/or rapid neck extension to capture prey that is visually detected or flushed only at short range. This technique appears to be driven proximately by the cormorant\u0027s limited visual capacities, and is analogous to the foraging techniques employed by herons.","bibo:AuthorList":["White, Craig R.","Day, Norman","Butler, Patrick J.","Martin, Graham R."],"dc:date":"2007-07-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52008,"sim:weight":0.488924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43924,"sim:weight":0.25217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62510,"sim:weight":0.241008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.194014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.183655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.183648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.168611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.168577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.165442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.165135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.164682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43105,"sim:weight":0.159605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31144,"sim:weight":0.157699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57891,"sim:weight":0.156452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.155988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.153909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.150292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61792,"sim:weight":0.130995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19345,"sim:weight":0.10322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":63694,"sim:weight":0.100858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is often asserted that such regulation enables a cell to homeostatically maintain protein abundance. We explore the role of negative self regulation of transcription in regulating the variability of protein abundance using a variety of stochastic modeling techniques. \n \nResults \nWe undertake a novel analysis of a classic model for negative self regulation. We demonstrate that, with standard approximations, protein variance relative to its mean should be independent of repressor strength in a physiological range. Consequently, in that range, the coefficient of variation would increase with repressor strength. However, stochastic computer simulations demonstrate that there is a greater increase in noise associated with strong repressors than predicted by theory. The discrepancies between the mathematical analysis and computer simulations arise because with strong repressors the approximation that leads to Michaelis-Menten-like hyperbolic repression terms ceases to be valid. Because we observe that strong negative feedback increases variability and so is unlikely to be a mechanism for noise control, we suggest instead that negative feedback is evolutionarily favoured because it allows the cell to minimize mRNA usage. To test this, we used in silico evolution to demonstrate that while negative feedback can achieve only a modest improvement in protein noise reduction compared with the unregulated system, it can achieve good improvement in protein response times and very substantial improvement in reducing mRNA levels. \n \nConclusions \nStrong negative self regulation of transcription may not always be a mechanism for homeostatic control of protein abundance, but instead might be evolutionarily favoured as a mechanism to limit the use of mRNA. The use of hyperbolic terms derived from quasi-steady-state approximation should also be avoided in the analysis of stochastic models with strong repressors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stekel, Dov J.","Jenkins, Dafyd J."],"dc:date":"2008-01-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26072,"sim:weight":0.409708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46883,"sim:weight":0.357731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387245,"sim:weight":0.354759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46894,"sim:weight":0.336971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.333713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.325236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.323076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.320141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46352,"sim:weight":0.313236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58185,"sim:weight":0.305411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98732,"sim:weight":0.267273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932450,"sim:weight":0.250617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77271,"sim:weight":0.246578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.23988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43061,"sim:weight":0.216228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26719,"sim:weight":0.213052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46551,"sim:weight":0.207254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934790,"sim:weight":0.199024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48649,"sim:weight":0.198954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43026,"sim:weight":0.182607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The causative agent, Cryptococcus neoformans, has a remarkable ability to \u0027hide\u0027 and proliferate within phagocytic cells of the human immune system. This intracellular phase is thought to underlie the ability of the pathogen to remain latent for long periods of time within infected individuals. \n \nResults \nWe now report that Cryptococcus is able to undergo \u0027lateral transfer\u0027 between phagocytes, moving directly from infected to uninfected macrophages. This novel process was observed in both C. neoformans serotypes (A and D) and occurs in both immortalised cell lines and in primary human macrophages. Lateral transfer is independent of the initial route of uptake, since both serum-opsonised and antibody-opsonised C. neoformans are able to undergo direct cell-to-cell transfer. \n \nConclusion \nWe provide the first evidence for lateral transfer of a human fungal pathogen. This rare event may occur repeatedly during latent cryptococcal infections, thereby allowing the pathogen to remain concealed from the immune system and protecting it from exposure to antifungal agents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ma, Hansong","Croudace, Joanne E.","Lammas, David A.","May, Robin C."],"dc:date":"2007-08-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77087,"sim:weight":0.663096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75828,"sim:weight":0.423492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.272694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387152,"sim:weight":0.249195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98959,"sim:weight":0.249065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99391,"sim:weight":0.245587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12407,"sim:weight":0.24188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269995,"sim:weight":0.229336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50016,"sim:weight":0.222423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269989,"sim:weight":0.215414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.210927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.201532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387241,"sim:weight":0.201354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98615,"sim:weight":0.190969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.184402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26480,"sim:weight":0.18274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.17603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26717,"sim:weight":0.172487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101909,"sim:weight":0.172442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.167886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Physical education has a firm place in teacher training in England because of its status as a National Curriculum foundation subject which guarantees entitlement for all children. The recruitment and retention of ethnic minority teachers has been a National concern for many years and yet it remains an under-researched area. Rising numbers of young Muslims, the majority of whom are of South Asian heritage, led to initiatives for attracting more trainees from this group into higher education. \r\n \r\nIn England, the century old provision of single-sex specialist physical education secondary training (for 11 – 18 year- olds) finally disappeared by the mid 1980s. Primary PEITT (for 5 – 11 year-olds) has traditionally been organised in mixed-sex groups. Therefore the current higher education training system for intending teachers provides only compulsory mixed-sex provision in PEITT at every level. The authors argue that the current situation excludes Muslim women who wish to enter the teaching profession and adhere to Islamic requirements. They recount a case study in one University that tracks policy development to make single-sex physical education available to Muslim women on a traditionally mixed-sex primary course.","bibo:AuthorList":["Benn, Tansin","Dagkas, Symeon"],"dc:date":"2006-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98927,"sim:weight":0.712045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.689902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664666,"sim:weight":0.660952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43669,"sim:weight":0.608657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090427,"sim:weight":0.597691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61043,"sim:weight":0.59262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48328,"sim:weight":0.54284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.535642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43809,"sim:weight":0.513493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108332,"sim:weight":0.49404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.488209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446416,"sim:weight":0.480951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383641,"sim:weight":0.443557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57213,"sim:weight":0.43496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.434021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48401,"sim:weight":0.433908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43728,"sim:weight":0.430304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49910,"sim:weight":0.428088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18050,"sim:weight":0.427577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709957,"sim:weight":0.402443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A U.K. focus has been adopted to illustrate the effects of roads in a landscape with a long history of land use and intensive land management where the impacts and the potential for improvement are considerable. The impacts of roads in the ecological landscape include habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation. These interrupt and modify natural processes altering community structures and in the longer term, population dynamics. The large number of fauna fatalities each year from road traffic accidents is also of concern. Road verges can however also provide habitat opportunities and restore connectivity in an otherwise fragmented landscape offering potential to offset some of the adverse impacts of the existing road network. This review demonstrates that roads can present both ecological costs and ecological benefits although currently there is insufficient evidence to confirm some of the key theories which relate to the impact of the barrier effects (at population level) or the value of road verges as ecological corridors. In the absence of complete information the full extent of the problems and opportunities cannot be gauged and every effort should be made therefore to enhance the habitat adjacent to existing roads and to constrain further fragmentation caused by the development of the existing road network. Where further construction is unavoidable conditions should be enforced to prevent roads from reducing further the remaining habitats of conservation value and the connectivity between such habitats.","bibo:AuthorList":["Underhill, Jackie E","Angold, Penny G"],"dc:date":"2000-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77855,"sim:weight":0.748973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60875,"sim:weight":0.460326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.434356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62227,"sim:weight":0.426131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.413299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62510,"sim:weight":0.411734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.40634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.40634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97600,"sim:weight":0.398498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631109,"sim:weight":0.390215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62062,"sim:weight":0.383132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60278,"sim:weight":0.377001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62713,"sim:weight":0.374463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60863,"sim:weight":0.372358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62195,"sim:weight":0.36368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386270,"sim:weight":0.361086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.356262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59910,"sim:weight":0.354397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75387,"sim:weight":0.352432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76858,"sim:weight":0.352432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Assessments of NSAID use based on authoritative guidelines typically overlook patients’ views and nuances of \r\nmedical history. Our objective was to develop an assessment tool that incorporates these aspects, and technical items, for quality of care assessments in NSAID users. \r\n \r\nMethods. Patients newly referred to a university hospital were interviewed by a nurse using an agreed template. A multidisciplinary group of rheumatologists, nurse specialists, primary care physicians and a pharmacist reviewed current guidance and systematic reviews on NSAID use, and a series of interview transcripts. The group agreed, by informal consensus, important determinants of effective and safe NSAID use. Technical aspects of medical care and items that reflected interpersonal care were included in an index for assessing quality of care for individual patients. Interview transcripts of 100 patients were scored by panel members and reliability of scores was tested by calculating weighted percentage agreement and the kappa statistic. \r\n \r\nResults. Our final index had five domains: medical risk factors; steps taken to reduce risk; knowledge of adverse effects; NSAID dose; and cost efficiency. Each item was scored 0, 1 or 2. Scores were summed, giving a maximum of 10 (low scores indicating low quality). Intra-rater agreement was \u003e90%; kappa was 0.47–0.87 for individual domains and 0.59 for overall score. Inter-rater agreement for overall score was 95%; kappa was 0.25–0.78 for domains and 0.48 for overall score. Patients with especially low scores were identified using the mode of scores for five assessors; obvious clinical concerns were identified, supporting index face validity. \r\n \r\nConclusions. A simple index to evaluate quality of care for NSAID users based on a patient interview is described. This may be used by one or more assessors to examine care standards and highlight deficiencies in relation to NSAID use in practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jobanputra, Paresh","Arthur, Valerie","Pugh, Mark","Spannuth, Frank","Griffiths, Peter","Thomas, Elizabeth","Sheeran, Tom"],"dc:date":"2005-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.331005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.315095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.290596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.27717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.274464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385778,"sim:weight":0.274185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43411,"sim:weight":0.257865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.245207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.226916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49820,"sim:weight":0.2269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9829,"sim:weight":0.221652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83165,"sim:weight":0.221652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.210413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.209058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.201073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":338381,"sim:weight":0.18414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43039,"sim:weight":0.176517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.175355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11157,"sim:weight":0.17165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.160041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, data on quality of life is rarely reported. This is especially important because patients treated with hydrotherapy often report an enhanced sense of well-being. We report a randomised controlled trial in which we compared the effects of hydrotherapy with exercises on land on overall response to treatment, physical function and quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. \r\n \r\nMethods \r\nOne hundred and fifteen patients with RA were randomised to receive a weekly 30-minute session of hydrotherapy or similar exercises on land for 6 weeks. Our primary outcome was a self-rated global impression of change – a measure of treatment effect on a 7-point scale ranging from 1(very much worse) to 7 (very much better) assessed immediately on completion of treatment. Secondary outcomes including EuroQol health related quality of life, EuroQol health status valuation, HAQ, 10 metre walk time and pain scores were collected at baseline, after treatment and 3 months later. Binary outcomes were analysed by Fisher\u0027s exact test and continuous variables by Wilcoxon or Mann-Whitney tests. \r\n \r\nResults \r\nBaseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable. Significantly more patients treated with hydrotherapy (40/46, 87%) were much better or very much better than the patients treated with land exercise (19/40, 47.5%), p \u003c 0.001 Fisher\u0027s exact test. Eleven patients allocated land exercise failed to complete treatment compared with 4 patients allocated hydrotherapy (p \u003d 0.09). Sensitivity analyses confirmed an advantage for hydrotherapy if we assumed non-completers would all not have responded (response rates 70% versus 38%; p \u003c 0.001) or if we assumed that non-completers would have had the same response as completers (response rates 82% versus 55% p \u003d 0.002). Ten metre walk time improved after treatment in both cases (median pre-treatment time for both groups combined 10.9 seconds, post-treatment 9.1 s, and 3 months later 9.6 s). There was however no difference between treatment groups. Similarly there were no significant differences between groups in terms of changes to HAQ, EQ-5D utility score, EQ VAS and pain VAS. \r\n \r\nConclusion \r\nPatients with RA treated with hydrotherapy are more likely to report feeling much better or very much better than those treated with land exercises immediately on completion of the treatment programme. This perceived benefit was not reflected by differences between groups in 10-metre walk times, functional scores, quality of life measures and pain scores.","bibo:AuthorList":["Eversden, Lis","Maggs, Fiona","Nightingale, Peter","Jobanputra, Paresh"],"dc:date":"2007-03-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9028213,"sim:weight":0.382844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387387,"sim:weight":0.357262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99453,"sim:weight":0.356072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90274,"sim:weight":0.35291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.336996,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.334062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25873,"sim:weight":0.324778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24375,"sim:weight":0.324364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708124,"sim:weight":0.322948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1151822,"sim:weight":0.309212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384731,"sim:weight":0.307258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.306964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1375730,"sim:weight":0.299493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.298336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.2972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.296445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19185,"sim:weight":0.292096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.291324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998632,"sim:weight":0.280891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.278038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One of the difficulties of this debate is that various interested parties have different needs with respect to such concepts. Some take a theorist’s perspective, and prioritise conceptual clarity and rigor. Others are more concerned with providing concepts that can be useful to real-life medical practice. And others are more concerned with wider policy and health-promotion issues, and seek a concept of health usable in a globalised context. \n \nIn this paper we want to suggest adopting a ‘capability approach’ to health and related concepts. Such an approach captures much of the best theoretical and conceptual work on these issues, while also being applicable to real life cases and actual practice.

The robustness of linear medial operators to noise is preserved in our algorithm. The effectiveness of the CMAT is accredited to the concordance property described in this paper.

Millican’s objection is based on his interpretation of the argument, according to which Anselm relies on what I call the ‘principle of the superiority of existence’ (PSE).

In this paper, we take a model of communicative competence that has been widely influential in both language teaching and language testing, namely Bachman (1990), and argue, giving a range of examples of language use and learner difficulty, that metaphoric competence has in fact an important role to play in all areas of communicative competence. In other words, it can contribute centrally to grammatical competence, textual competence, illocutionary competence, sociolinguistic competence, and strategic competence. Metaphor is thus highly relevant to second language learning, teaching and testing, from the earliest to the most advanced stages of learning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Littlemore, Jeannette","Low, Graham"],"dc:date":"2006-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":76515,"sim:weight":0.597541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145233,"sim:weight":0.592176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17956,"sim:weight":0.546201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43860,"sim:weight":0.506676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85729,"sim:weight":0.4929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17914,"sim:weight":0.485839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.484948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108961,"sim:weight":0.479026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.473521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.458201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.457461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99120,"sim:weight":0.452788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77378,"sim:weight":0.445147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108285,"sim:weight":0.445054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108290,"sim:weight":0.439947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108341,"sim:weight":0.437832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.433931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98933,"sim:weight":0.431053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.426391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69411,"sim:weight":0.426229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the climatological meaning of many speleothem records cannot be interpreted unequivocally; this is particularly so for more subtle shifts and shorter time periods, but the use of multiple proxies and improving understanding of formation mechanisms offers a clear way forward. An explicit description of speleothem records as time series draws attention to the nature and importance of the signal filtering processes by which the weather, the seasons and longer-term climatic and other environmental fluctuations become encoded in speleothems. We distinguish five sources of variation that influence speleothem geochemistry: atmospheric, vegetation/soil, karstic aquifer, primary speleothem crystal growth and secondary alteration and give specific examples of their influence. The direct role of climate diminishes progressively through these five factors. \r\n \r\nWe identify and review a number of processes identified in recent and current work that bear significantly on the conventional interpretation of speleothem records, for example: \r\n \r\n1) speleothem geochemistry can vary seasonally and hence a research need is to establish the proportion of growth attributable to different seasons and whether this varies over time. \r\n \r\n2) whereas there has traditionally been a focus on monthly mean Ã�Â´18O data of atmospheric moisture, current work emphasizes the importance of understanding the synoptic processes that lead to characteristic isotope signals, since changing relative abundance of different weather types might 1Corresponding author, fax +44(0)1214145528, E-mail: i.j.fairchild@bham.ac.uk control their variation on the longer-term. \r\n \r\n3) the ecosystem and soil zone overlying the cave fundamentally imprint the carbon and trace element signals and can show characteristic variations with time. \r\n \r\n4) new modelling on aquifer plumbing allows quantification of the effects of aquifer mixing. \r\n \r\n5) recent work has emphasized the importance and seasonal variability of CO2-degassing leading to calcite precipitation upflow of a depositional site on carbon isotope and trace element composition of speleothems. \r\n \r\n6) Although much is known about the chemical partitioning between water and stalagmites, variability in relation to crystal growth mechanisms and kinetics is a research frontier. \r\n \r\n7) Aragonite is susceptible to conversion to calcite with major loss of chemical information, but the controls on the rate of this process are obscure. \r\n \r\nAnalytical factors are critical to generate high-resolution speleothem records. A variety of methods of trace element analysis are available, but standardization is a common problem with the most rapid methods. New stable isotope data on Irish stalagmite CC3 compares rapid laser-ablation techniques with the conventional analysis of micromilled powders and ion microprobe methods. A high degree of comparability between techniques for Ã�Â´18O is found on the mm-cm scale, but a previously described high-amplitude oxygen isotope excursion around 8.3 ka is identified as an analytical artefact related to fractionation of the laser-analysis associated with sample cracking. High-frequency variability of not less than 0.5o/oo may be an inherent feature of speleothem Ã�Â´18O records.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fairchild, Ian J","Smith, Claire L","Baker, Andy","Fuller, Lisa","Spotl, Christoph","Mattey, Dave","McDermott, Frank"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108061,"sim:weight":0.72782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":500777,"sim:weight":0.717143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2712,"sim:weight":0.650514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001847,"sim:weight":0.646899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386785,"sim:weight":0.599001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62777,"sim:weight":0.595273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52219,"sim:weight":0.580126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631512,"sim:weight":0.525383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999460,"sim:weight":0.516712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1096978,"sim:weight":0.49993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5838646,"sim:weight":0.495133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62465,"sim:weight":0.485939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269966,"sim:weight":0.485363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":541603,"sim:weight":0.481615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1096979,"sim:weight":0.473823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":500769,"sim:weight":0.469932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69157,"sim:weight":0.463259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75346,"sim:weight":0.462766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382180,"sim:weight":0.459257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268392,"sim:weight":0.4544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Meta-analyses of effectiveness data were also undertaken for each agent. The Birmingham Rheumatoid Arthritis Model (BRAM), a simulation model, was further developed and used to produce an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. \r\n \r\nResults: Twenty-nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs), most of high quality, were included. The only head-to-head comparisons were against methotrexate. For patients with short disease duration (≤3 years) who were naïve to methotrexate, adalimumab was marginally less and etanercept was marginally more effective than methotrexate in reducing symptoms of RA. Etanercept was better tolerated than methotrexate. Both adalimumab and etanercept were more effective than methotrexate in slowing radiographic joint damage. Etanercept was also marginally more effective and better tolerated than methotrexate in patients with longer disease durations who had not failed methotrexate treatment. Infliximab is only licensed for use with methotrexate. All three agents, either alone (where so licensed) or in combination with ongoing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), were effective in reducing the symptoms and signs of RA in patients with established disease. At the licensed dose, the numbers needed to treat (NNTs) (95% CI) required to produce an American College for Rheumatology (ACR) response compared with placebo were: ACR20: adalimumab 3.6 (3.1 to 4.2), etanercept 2.1 (1.9 to 2.4), infliximab 3.2 (2.7 to 4.0); ACR50: adalimumab 4.2 (3.7 to 5.0), etanercept 3.1 (2.7 to 3.6), infliximab 5.0 (3.8 to 6.7); and ACR70: adalimumab 7.7 (5.9 to 11.1), etanercept 7.7 (6.3 to 10.0), infliximab 11.1 (7.7 to 20.0). In patients who were naïve to methotrexate, or who had not previously failed methotrexate treatment, a TNF inhibitor combined with methotrexate was significantly more effective than methotrexate alone. Infliximab combined with methotrexate had an increased risk of serious infections. All ten published economic evaluations met standard criteria for quality, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from being within established thresholds to being very high because of varying assumptions and parameters. All three sponsors who submitted economic models made assumptions favourable to their product. BRAM incorporates improvements in quality of life and mortality, but assumes no effect of TNF inhibitors on joint replacement. For use in accordance with current NICE guidance as the third DMARD in a sequence of DMARDs, the base-case ICER was around £30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in early RA and £50,000 per QALY in late RA. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were sensitive to the estimates of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) progression while on TNF inhibitors and the effectiveness of DMARDs, but not to changes in mortality ratios per unit HAQ. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used last. The ICER for etanercept used last is £24,000 per QALY, substantially lower than for adalimumab (£30,000 per QALY) or infliximab (£38,000 per QALY). First line use as monotherapy generates ICERs around £50,000 per QALY for adalimumab and etanercept. Using the combination of methotrexate and a TNF inhibitor as first line treatment generates much higher ICERs, as it precludes subsequent use of methotrexate, which is cheap. The ICERs for sequential use are of the same order as using the TNF inhibitor alone. \r\n \r\nConclusions: Adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab are effective treatments compared with placebo for RA patients who are not well controlled by conventional DMARDs, improving control of symptoms, improving physical function, and slowing radiographic changes in joints. The combination of a TNF inhibitor with methotrexate was more effective than methotrexate alone in early RA, although the clinical relevance of this additional benefit is yet to be established, particularly in view of the well-established effectiveness of MTX alone. An increased risk of serious infection cannot be ruled out for the combination of methotrexate with adalimumab or infliximab. The results of the economic evaluation based on BRAM are consistent with the observations from the review of clinical effectiveness, including the ranking of treatments. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used as last active therapy. In this analysis, other things being equal, etanercept may be the TNF inhibitor of choice, although this may also depend on patient preference as to route of administration. The next most cost-effective use of TNF inhibitors is third line, as recommended in the 2002 NICE guidance. Direct comparative RCTs of TNF inhibitors against each other and against other DMARDs, and sequential use in patients who have failed a previous TNF inhibitor, are needed. Longer term studies of the quality of life in patients with RA and the impact of DMARDs on this are needed, as are longer studies that directly assess effects on joint replacement, other morbidity and mortality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chen, Y-F.","Jobanputra, Paresh","Barton, Pelham","Jowett, S.M.","Bryan, S.","Clark, Wendy","Fry-Smith, A.","Burls, Amanda"],"dc:date":"2006-11-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":49576,"sim:weight":0.420371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1151822,"sim:weight":0.404804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":670426,"sim:weight":0.397418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103579,"sim:weight":0.371092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384639,"sim:weight":0.370703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43039,"sim:weight":0.357149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145722,"sim:weight":0.331692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":517705,"sim:weight":0.322874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1090808,"sim:weight":0.320723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1375730,"sim:weight":0.309844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177062,"sim:weight":0.305395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222879,"sim:weight":0.278356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23113,"sim:weight":0.277895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19286,"sim:weight":0.269424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1115222,"sim:weight":0.261194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145929,"sim:weight":0.255914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43850,"sim:weight":0.25549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187753,"sim:weight":0.253959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24404,"sim:weight":0.253523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998575,"sim:weight":0.252171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Scrip, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions for new drug applications, European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) reports and the pharmaceutical company submission to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. \r\n \r\nReview methods: \r\n \r\nStudies were identified that included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or economic evaluations of anakinra in adult patients with RA. Existing health economic reviews were also assessed. Data were extracted and quality assessed using a structured approach. The Birmingham Rheumatoid Arthritis Model (BRAM) was used to compare disease-modifying antirheumatic drug(DMARD) sequences, chosen to reflect current clinical practice, with and without anakinra, at different points in the DMARD sequence. \r\n \r\nResults: \r\n \r\nFive high-quality RCTs of anakinra in adult patients with RA, involving a total of 2905 patients, of whom 2146 received anakinra, were identified. The results of the clinical trials were consistent with clinical benefit (compared with placebo) as measured by American College of heumatology (ACR) composite response rate at 6 months. Variation in response rate was seen across the trials, which is likely to be a reflection of the size of the trials and the wide range of doses evaluated. Consistent benefit was seen at the higher dose evaluated. Benefit was evident both with monotherapy and when used in combination with methotrexate. Data on the efficacy end-points evaluated in a large pragmatic safety study have not been made available, which is of concern. Anakinra treatment was associated with a high incidence of injection site reactions. Serious adverse events were infrequent, but longer term follow-up is required. No fully published economic evaluations of anakinra in patients with RA were identified. The BRAM gives a base-case estimate of the incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) of anakinra of £106,000 to £604,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). In the sensitivity analyses substantial variations were made in key parameters and ICERs were shown to be responsive. However, ICERs did not drop below £50,000/QALY in any univariate sensitivity analysis. \r\n \r\nConclusions: \r\n \r\nAnakinra can be considered modestly effective in the treatment of RA based on ACR response, although no conclusion can currently be made on the effect of treatment on disease progression. Adjusted indirect comparison suggests that anakinra may be significantly less effective at relieving the clinical signs and symptoms of RA, as measured by the ACR response criteria, than tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors all used in combination with methotrexate, although these results should be interpreted with caution. The BRAM produces an ICER for anakinra substantially higher than those for infliximab and etanercept. However, patients may respond to anakinra when they have not responded to other TNF inhibitors, as these agents have a different mechanism of action. Thus, anakinra may produce a clinically significant and important improvement in some patients that they could not otherwise have achieved. Further research would be valuable in the following areas: RCTs to evaluate the efficacy, safety and cost of anakinra over the longer term; comparative trials of anakinra with other DMARDs and biological modifiers; assessment of the role of anakinra in the treatment of patients who have failed to achieve a benefit while taking infliximab or etanercept; assessment on the impact of DMARDs and anakinra on joint replacement, \r\nmortality and quality of life; controlled clinical trials of combination therapy with two anticytokines; investigations into newer biological therapies; and the utility of radiographic outcomes in clinical trials of RA.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clark, Wendy","Jobanputra, Paresh","Barton, Pelham","Burls, Amanda"],"dc:date":"2004-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":759357,"sim:weight":0.374362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.361717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49576,"sim:weight":0.355751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43039,"sim:weight":0.331948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1151822,"sim:weight":0.328054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24404,"sim:weight":0.322684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87618,"sim:weight":0.320245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76079,"sim:weight":0.31439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80077,"sim:weight":0.30446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1490396,"sim:weight":0.302171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222879,"sim:weight":0.295604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23113,"sim:weight":0.294645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24379,"sim:weight":0.294645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":670426,"sim:weight":0.291919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1115222,"sim:weight":0.286499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1489065,"sim:weight":0.285931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.280011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1073428,"sim:weight":0.279864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24375,"sim:weight":0.277046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227873,"sim:weight":0.270578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this study was to assess the level of awareness and prevalence of these factors in women attending family history clinics. \nMethods: Women attending the breast cancer family history clinic from 2004 to 2006 completed a questionnaire (SP15 format) about their knowledge of and exposure to various diet and lifestyle factors. All women had been counselled by a Consultant Cancer Geneticist and were given verbal and written information on the effect of life style on breast cancer risk. Responses were analysed using SPSS™ software. \n \nResults: The response rate was 70% and two thirds of women were post-menopausal. The prevalence of obesity in post-menopausal women was 37% with 40% being overweight. The majority of women consumed a healthy balanced diet. Only 15% of post-menopausal women exercised for more than 4 hours per week. Two-thirds of women correctly stated that obesity increases their breast cancer risk and 73% of these were overweight or obese. Over 87% were correctly aware of the role of family history, 68% of a high fat diet, and 57% of hormone replacement therapy in the development of breast cancer. \n \nConclusion: Women attending family history clinics lead a high risk lifestyle for the development of breast cancer with high prevalence of obesity and low levels of physical activity. A campaign of patient education is needed to promote healthy lifestyle choices, especially physical activity, in these high-risk women.","bibo:AuthorList":["Begum, Parvin","Richardson, Caroline E","Carmichael, Amtul R"],"dc:date":"2009-01-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23820,"sim:weight":0.56029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":916505,"sim:weight":0.483363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100417,"sim:weight":0.413064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46324,"sim:weight":0.39781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10928,"sim:weight":0.353233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57403,"sim:weight":0.349621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18046,"sim:weight":0.345553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929822,"sim:weight":0.321314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.317331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22729,"sim:weight":0.315824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1040471,"sim:weight":0.305921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.299659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.29293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23873,"sim:weight":0.29293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23524,"sim:weight":0.272695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.261849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.260565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102958,"sim:weight":0.247437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033299,"sim:weight":0.246487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45714,"sim:weight":0.233368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

PRH is able to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation and is required for the formation of the vertebrate body axis, the haematopoietic and vascular systems and the formation of many vital organs. PRH is a DNAbinding protein that can repress and activate the transcription of its target genes using multiple mechanisms. In addition, PRH can regulate the nuclear transport of specific mRNAs making PRH a member of a select group of proteins that control gene expression at the transcriptional and translational levels. Recent biophysical analysis of the PRH protein has shown that it forms homo-oligomeric complexes in vivo and in vitro and that the proline-rich region of PRH forms a novel dimerization interface.

Sensory inputs alone cannot provide a perfect state signal because of inevitable delays in their afferent pathways. We have recently reported the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the ipsilateral cerebellum as healthy subjects made rapid reaching movements towards visually defined targets (Miall et al. in PLoS Biology 5:2733–2744, 2007). Errors in the initial direction and in the final finger position of this reachto-target movement were consistent with the reaching movements being planned and initiated from an estimated hand position that was about 138 ms out of date. This interval is consistent with estimates of the delays in sensory motor pathways that would inform the central nervous system of the peripheral status. We now report new data using the same paradigm, testing the effects of varying the TMS stimulus train from one, two, or three pulses. We show that the errors in movement are relatively insensitive to the TMS pulse-train duration. The estimated time interval by which the hand position is mislocalized varied by only 12 ms as the TMS train duration increased by 100 ms. Thus, this interval is likely to reflect physiological processes within the cerebellum rather than the TMSstimulus duration. This new evidence supports our earlier claim that the cerebellum is responsible for predictively updating a central state estimate over an interval of about 120–140 ms. Dysfunction of the cerebellum, whether through disease or experimental procedures, leads to motor errors consistent with a loss of knowledge of the true state of the motor system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miall, R.

However, there are no empirical studies illustrating the relative advantages of the various methods of analysis within a random utility framework. \n \nMethods: Multinomial and weighted least squares regression models were estimated for a discrete choice experiment. The discrete choice experiment incorporated a best-worst study and was conducted in a UK NHS dermatology context. Waiting time, expertise of doctor, convenience of attending and perceived thoroughness of care were varied across 16 hypothetical appointments. Sample level preferences were estimated for all models and differences between patient subgroups were investigated using ovariateadjusted multinomial logistic regression. \n \nResults: A high level of agreement was observed between results from the paired model (which is theoretically consistent with the \u0027maxdiff\u0027 choice model) and the marginal model (which is only an approximation to it). Adjusting for covariates showed that patients who felt particularly affected by their skin condition during the previous week displayed extreme preference for short/no waiting time and were less concerned about other aspects of the appointment. Higher levels of educational attainment were associated with larger differences in utility between the levels of all attributes, although the attributes per use had the same impact upon choices as those with lower levels of attainment. The study also demonstrated the high levels of agreement between summary analyses using weighted least squares and estimates from multinomial models. \n \nConclusion: Robust policy-relevant information on preferences can be obtained from discrete choice \nexperiments incorporating best-worst questions with relatively small sample sizes. The separation of the \neffects due to attribute impact from the position of levels on the latent utility scale is not possible using \ntraditional discrete choice experiments. This separation is important because health policies to change the \nlevels of attributes in health care may be very different from those aiming to change the attribute impact \nper se. The good approximation of summary analyses to the multinomial model is a useful finding, because weighted least squares choice totals give better insights into the choice model and promote greater familiarity with the preference data.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flynn, Terry N","Louviere, Jordan J","Peters, Tim J","Coast, Joanna"],"dc:date":"2008-11-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":103600,"sim:weight":0.444117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49813,"sim:weight":0.35803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.347934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101248,"sim:weight":0.333954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.316998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.311925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.306965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.30539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999797,"sim:weight":0.295202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.28867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133715,"sim:weight":0.283921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.26237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.26237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.235951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.232371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.219263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2745396,"sim:weight":0.214995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.203807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337351,"sim:weight":0.194912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17910,"sim:weight":0.193742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the expansion ratio of human iNKT cells varies between individuals and this has implications for attempts to manipulate this pathway therapeutically. We have studied a panel of twenty five healthy human donors to assess the variability in their in-vitro iNKT cell expansion responses to stimulation with CD1d ligands and investigated some of the factors that may influence this phenomenon. \n \nResults \nAlthough all donors had comparable numbers of circulating iNKT cells their growth rates in-vitro over 14 days in response to a range of CD1d ligands and IL-2 were highly donor-dependent. Two reproducible donor response patterns of iNKT expansion were seen which we have called \u0027strong\u0027 or \u0027poor\u0027 iNKT responders. Donor response phenotype did not correlate with age, gender, frequency of circulating iNKT, or with the CD1d ligand utilised. Addition of exogenous recombinant human interleukin 4 (IL-4) to \u0027poor\u0027 responder donor cultures significantly increased their iNKT proliferative capacity, but not to levels equivalent to that of \u0027strong\u0027 responder donors.

However, the assumptions of random utility theory, which underpin the statistical models used to provide these estimates, have received insufficient attention. In particular, the assumptions made about the decisions between living states and the death state are not satisfied, at least for some people. Estimated values are likely to be incorrectly anchored with respect to death (zero) in such circumstances. \n \nMethods: Data from the Investigating Choice Experiments for the preferences of older people CAPability instrument (ICECAP) valuation exercise were analysed. The values (previously anchored to the worst possible state) were rescaled using an ordinal model proposed previously to estimate QALY-like values. Bootstrapping was conducted to vary artificially the proportion of people who conformed to the conventional random utility model underpinning the analyses. \n \nResults: Only 26% of respondents conformed unequivocally to the assumptions of conventional random \nutility theory. At least 14% of respondents unequivocally violated the assumptions. Varying the relative \nproportions of conforming respondents in sensitivity analyses led to large changes in the estimated QALY \nvalues, particularly for lower-valued states. As a result these values could be either positive (considered \nto be better than death) or negative (considered to be worse than death). \n \nConclusion: Use of a statistical model such as conditional (multinomial) regression to anchor quality of life values from ordinal data to death is inappropriate in the presence of respondents who do not conform to the assumptions of conventional random utility theory. This is clearest when estimating values for that group of respondents observed in valuation samples who refuse to consider any living state to be worse than death: in such circumstances the model cannot be estimated. Only a valuation task requiring respondents to make choices in which both length and quality of life vary can produce estimates that properly reflect the preferences of all respondents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flynn, Terry N","Louviere, Jordan J","Marley, Anthony AJ","Coast, Joanna","Peters, Tim J"],"dc:date":"2008-10-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":103596,"sim:weight":0.444117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.416477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101248,"sim:weight":0.378826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101608,"sim:weight":0.367249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.355492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.346001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.346001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.340284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101625,"sim:weight":0.33929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.338734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.312742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.289835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385292,"sim:weight":0.276411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.22144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74290,"sim:weight":0.215865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.170893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.16206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933163,"sim:weight":0.158818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41234,"sim:weight":0.149639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.148306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These include voting behaviour, charity work, and preparation for later life. In contrast to standard school effectiveness and improvement studies, we find that student/family background and institution-levels factors are relatively minor determinants of citizenship outcomes. If accepted this suggests that improvements here can come easier than in more traditional school outcomes, since they appear to be more sensitive to teacher and students experiences. In particular, we propose further investigation of the promise of student autonomy, staff prioritisation of student aspirations, and mutual respect between all actors in education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gorard, Stephen","See, Beng Huat","Shaheen, Robina"],"dc:date":"2009-06-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":49910,"sim:weight":0.589124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76945,"sim:weight":0.576162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101388,"sim:weight":0.548962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271227,"sim:weight":0.535243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.527689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176845,"sim:weight":0.517567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.507778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.494442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98457,"sim:weight":0.490833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.48536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5127,"sim:weight":0.463259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.449974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.438503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.431876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383611,"sim:weight":0.405096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.397238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.397238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.371812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83373,"sim:weight":0.365845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2853,"sim:weight":0.327002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The young people were faced with a number of realistic situations in the form of vignettes, intended to elicit the principles of justice to be applied in different domains, and also asked more directly about fairness both within and beyond school, and their family and educational experiences. The pupils’ background, the nature and intake to their schools, and their reported experiences at school, are here used in regression models to try and help explain how pupils learn to trust others, to allow extra assistance for the most disadvantaged, and what they aspire to in later life. The findings are somewhat different for each outcome, but in general pupil background plays a role. More importantly for policy perhaps, there is a small peer effect. Most importantly, pupils’ experiences at school are the key to explaining most of the observed variation. In general, those treated with respect by other pupils and teachers were more likely to report trusting others, being prepared to help others, and confidence in their futures. In a sense these findings are predictable, but their practical implications, if accepted, would be considerable.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gorard, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":270152,"sim:weight":0.589842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101496,"sim:weight":0.587066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.572341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.539837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9624511,"sim:weight":0.508655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2823,"sim:weight":0.48862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48401,"sim:weight":0.479207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.466226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46829,"sim:weight":0.440592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.415186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269878,"sim:weight":0.414335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83517,"sim:weight":0.388075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3214,"sim:weight":0.350084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2859,"sim:weight":0.332336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.329666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83523,"sim:weight":0.328191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82850,"sim:weight":0.325018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.322999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.322999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82602,"sim:weight":0.317011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Firstly, it investigated whether a general measure or specific measure of motivational orientation was better in describing the relationship between motivation and exercise behaviour. Secondly, it examined the relationship between the four most popular indirect methods of body composition assessment and physical activity and exercise patterns. Thirdly, the interaction between motivation and body composition on physical activity and exercise behaviour was explored in a sample of 275 Filipino male and female students. Males were found to have higher levels of exercise whereas females had higher levels of physical activity. Furthermore, general self-motivation together with body weight and percentage body fat were found to be the best predictor of exercise behaviour whereas the tension/pressure subscale of the ‘Intrinsic Motivation Inventory’ (IMI) was the best predictor of levels of physical activity. However, significant gender differences were observed. That is, for the males only self-motivation and for the females only body weight and BMI predicted exercise behaviour. Also, tension/pressure predicted physical activity levels for the females but not the males. No inverse relationship was found between the four body composition measures and exercise and physical activity behaviour. The results support the notion that the psychobiological approach might be particularly relevant for high intensity exercise situations but also highlights some important gender differences. Finally, the results of this study emphasise the need for more cross-cultural research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Polman, Remco","Pieter, Willy","Bercades, Luigi T.","Ntoumanis, Nikos"],"dc:date":"2004-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":76297,"sim:weight":0.489784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387053,"sim:weight":0.481197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19105,"sim:weight":0.465341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19200,"sim:weight":0.451762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.434949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23873,"sim:weight":0.407937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19109,"sim:weight":0.403801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19108,"sim:weight":0.402985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19162,"sim:weight":0.341492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929822,"sim:weight":0.314432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98621,"sim:weight":0.304418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19142,"sim:weight":0.288762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.279728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.274218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23524,"sim:weight":0.26937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19154,"sim:weight":0.269345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19115,"sim:weight":0.255532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.251919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85180,"sim:weight":0.250098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18046,"sim:weight":0.246804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Small grafts of normal cartilage removed from the patient’s diseased joint are treated in a laboratory to obtain cartilage cells. These cells are cultured to expand the cell population and reimplanted a few weeks later into areas where cartilage is denuded by disease. The aim of this procedure is to restore normal cartilage to the ends of bones and thereby restore normal joint function. \r\n \r\nEpidemiology \r\n \r\nThere are no reliable estimates of the prevalence of cartilage defects in the knee. Lesions are most likely to arise in sportsmen and women as a result of injury. Up to 20% of individuals sustaining a haemarthrosis following a knee injury may have cartilage damage. \r\n \r\nObjectives \r\n \r\nThis systematic review of the available evidence was performed to: \r\n \r\n1. Describe the types of knee disease for which ACT has been applied, the natural history and epidemiology of these conditions, and alternative treatment options \r\n2. Determine long-term clinical outcomes following ACT and other surgical procedures for knee cartilage defects \r\n3. Examine the economic evidence and consider the economic gains resulting from ACT. \r\n \r\nMethods \r\n \r\nTo analyse the effectiveness of treatment and the resultant economic impact, a systematic review of the literature, involving a range of databases, was performed. In addition, contact was made with leading researchers and industry. Full details are described in the main report. \r\n \r\nResults \r\n \r\nNumber and quality of studies and direction of evidence Of 46 identified reports, 17 met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Eight of the included reports were available as abstracts only. At least 2600 patients appear to have been treated with ACT. All included reports were case series with a variable length of follow-up. With one exception, all the studies reported improvement in patient status, usually over a follow-up period of less than 2 years. \r\n \r\nSummary of benefits \r\n \r\nThe outcome of ACT surgery was rated as ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ by approximately 70% of patients 2 years after treatment. Approximately 16% of patients required further arthroscopic surgical procedures during follow-up, and treatment was judged to have failed in 3–7% of patients. For comparator treatments, the outcome was rated as ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ in 10–95% of patients 2 years after treatment. \r\n \r\nEconomic review \r\n \r\nThe reports of two studies, one based in the USA and the other in Sweden, included economic data. Neither study compared ACT with other treatments. Using data from these studies and other sources, it was estimated that ACT performed in the UK would cost £4667 or £8167 for cell culture and surgery, depending on which service provider was used for cell culture. Incremental cost over 2 years, when set against comparator treatments, was estimated to be £3771 or £7271 (base case) for cell culture, surgery and rehabilitation. Using the OsCell facility for cell culture (Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic and District Hospital NHS Trust), this figure would be £3167. \r\n \r\nConclusions \r\n \r\nThe reported literature on ACT and comparators is subject to bias because of the inherent weaknesses of case series. In addition, the long-term impact of conventional surgical treatments or no surgical treatment is poorly documented. The cost-effectiveness analysis is similarly limited by the poverty of the effectiveness data on both ACT and comparators, the lack of long-term follow-up and the lack of empirical data for some of the parameters in the model used. \r\n \r\nRecommendations for research \r\n \r\nFurther studies are required to: \r\n \r\n1. Provide more accurate data on the occurrence of hyaline cartilage defects, including defects that arise acutely and those that are secondary to other types of knee injuries \r\n2. Clarify the relationship of cartilage defects to clinical symptoms \r\n3. Evaluate in detail the natural history of cartilage defects diagnosed by modern arthroscopic methods \r\n4.

An obstacle to widespread adoption of this approach is the requirement to formulate a biological pathway as machine executable computer code. We have recently proposed a novel, biologically intuitive, narrative-style modelling language for biologists to formulate the pathway which is then automatically translated into an executable format and is, thus, usable for analysis via existing simulation techniques. RESULTS: Here we use a high-level narrative language in designing a computational model of the gp130/JAK/STAT signalling pathway and show that the model reproduces the dynamic behaviour of the pathway derived by biological observation. We then \"experiment\" on the model by simulation and sensitivity analysis to define those parameters which dominate the dynamic behaviour of the pathway. The model predicts that nuclear compartmentalisation and phosphorylation status of STAT are key determinants of the pathway and that alternative mechanisms of signal attenuation exert their influence on different timescales. CONCLUSION: The described narrative model of the gp130/JAK/STAT pathway represents an interesting case study showing how, by using this approach, researchers can model biological systems without explicitly dealing with formal notations and mathematical expressions (typically used for biochemical modelling), nevertheless being able to obtain simulation and analysis results. We present the model and the sensitivity analysis results we have obtained, that allow us to identify the parameters which are most sensitive to perturbations. The results, which are shown to be in agreement with existing mathematical models of the gp130/JAK/STAT pathway, serve us as a form of validation of the model and of the approach itself.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guerriero, Maria Luisa","Dudka, Anna","Underhill-Day, Nicholas","Heath, John K","Priami, Corrado"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Our biologically simple model suffers a combinatorial explosion in the number of differential equations required to simulate the system. In addition to numerically solving the full model, we show that it can be accurately simplified. This requires combining matched asymptotics, the quasi-steady state hypothesis, and the fact subsets of the equations decouple asymptotically. Both the full and simplified models reproduce the qualitative dynamics observed experimentally and in previous stochastic models. The simplified model also elucidates both the qualitative features of GRB2 binding and the complex relationship between SHP2 levels, the rate SHP2 induces dephosphorylation and levels of bound GRB2. In addition to providing insight into the important and redundant features of FGF signaling, such work further highlights the usefulness of numerous simplification techniques in the study of mass action models of signal transduction, as also illustrated recently by Borisov and co-workers (Borisov et al. in Biophys. J. 89, 951-966, 2005, Biosystems 83, 152-166, 2006; Kiyatkin et al. in J. Biol. Chem. 281, 19925-19938, 2006).

Although its importance to topics such as ecosystem services and resilience is well recognized, the broader relationship between robustness and evolution is only starting to be fully appreciated. A renewed interest in this relationship has been prompted by evidence that mutational robustness can play a positive role in the discovery of adaptive innovations (evolvability) and evidence of an intimate relationship between robustness and complexity in biology. \n \nThis paper offers a new perspective on the mechanics of evolution and the origins of complexity, robustness, and evolvability. Here we explore the hypothesis that degeneracy, a partial overlap in the functioning of multi-functional components, plays a central role in the evolution and robustness of complex forms. In support of this hypothesis, we present evidence that degeneracy is a fundamental source of robustness, it is intimately tied to multi-scaled complexity, and it establishes conditions that are necessary for system evolvability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Whitacre, James M"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":107588,"sim:weight":0.711568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77652,"sim:weight":0.422192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.376199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26952,"sim:weight":0.339866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.326142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.284816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.284816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To address these limitations, two new questionnaire measures were developed: the Controlling Coach Behaviours Scale and the Psychological Need Thwarting Scale. Analysis of subsequent data revealed that need satisfaction was predicted by autonomy-supportive behaviours whilst need thwarting was better predicted by coach control. In turn, athletes’ perceptions of need satisfaction predicted positive outcomes (i.e. vitality and positive affect) whereas need thwarting consistently better predicted maladaptive outcomes (i.e. disordered eating, burnout, depression, negative affect, physical symptoms, and  perturbed physiological functioning). Such findings have important implications for the operationalisation and measurement of interpersonal styles and psychological needs both in sport and in other life domains.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bartholomew, Kimberley","Ntoumanis, Nikos","Thøgersen-Ntoumani, Cecilie"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":76502,"sim:weight":0.237921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Viral entry is required for initiation, spread, and maintenance of infection, making it an attractive target for antiviral strategies. The tight junction protein claudin-1 (CLDN1) has been shown to be required for entry of HCV into the cell. METHODS: Using genetic immunization, we produced 6 monoclonal antibodies against the host entry factor CLDN1. The effects of antibodies on HCV infection were analyzed in human cell lines and primary human hepatocytes. RESULTS: Competition and binding studies demonstrated that antibodies interacted with conformational epitopes of the first extracellular loop of CLDN1; binding of these antibodies required the motif W(30)-GLW(51)-C(54)-C(64) and residues in the N-terminal third of CLDN1. The monoclonal antibodies against CLDN1 efficiently inhibited infection by HCV of all major genotypes as well as highly variable HCV quasispecies isolated from individual patients. Furthermore, antibodies efficiently blocked cell entry of highly infectious escape variants of HCV that were resistant to neutralizing antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Monoclonal antibodies against the HCV entry factor CLDN1 might be used to prevent HCV infection, such as after liver transplantation, and might also restrain virus spread in chronically infected patients.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fofana, Isabel","Krieger, Sophie E","Grunert, Fritz","Glauben, Sandra","Xiao, Fei","Fafi-Kremer, Samira","Soulier, Eric","Royer, Cathy","Thumann, Christine","Mee, Christopher J","McKeating, Jane A","Dragic, Tatjana","Pessaux, Patrick","Stoll-Keller, Francoise","Schuster, Catherine","Thompson, John","Baumert, Thomas F"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77078,"sim:weight":0.501548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26480,"sim:weight":0.159508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77916,"sim:weight":0.151404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.128564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77207,"sim:weight":0.100425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the current study, we further characterized silymarin\u0027s antiviral actions. Silymarin had antiviral effects against hepatitis C virus cell culture (HCVcc) infection that included inhibition of virus entry, RNA and protein expression, and infectious virus production. Silymarin did not block HCVcc binding to cells but inhibited the entry of several viral pseudoparticles (pp), and fusion of HCVpp with liposomes. Silymarin but not silibinin inhibited genotype 2a NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity at concentrations 5 to 10 times higher than required for anti-HCVcc effects. Furthermore, silymarin had inefficient activity on the genotype 1b BK and four 1b RDRPs derived from HCV-infected patients. Moreover, silymarin did not inhibit HCV replication in five independent genotype 1a, 1b, and 2a replicon cell lines that did not produce infectious virus. Silymarin inhibited microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity, apolipoprotein B secretion, and infectious virion production into culture supernatants. Silymarin also blocked cell-to-cell spread of virus.

Although HCV-specific CD4 T-cell response is associated with HCV clearance, less is known about virus-specific CD8 T-cell or neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses and the role of CD4 help in their induction during acute infection. METHODS: HCV-specific CD4, CD8, and HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) nAb responses were monitored in acutely HCV-infected patients to define their relative contributions to viral clearance. RESULTS: Our results show that the outcome of acute hepatitis C is associated with a functional hierarchy in HCV-specific CD4 T-cell response and the scope of virus-specific, total T-cell interferon-gamma response. HCV-specific CD8 T-cell response was readily detectable in acutely HCV-infected patients regardless of virologic outcome or virus-specific CD4 T-cell response. In contrast, HCVpp-specific nAbs were readily detected in patients with chronic evolution and impaired virus-specific CD4 T-cell response but not in patients who cleared infection with robust virus-specific CD4 T-cell response. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of acute hepatitis C is associated with efficient virus-specific CD4 T-cell response(s) without which HCV-specific CD8 T-cell and heterologous nAb responses may develop but fail to clear viremia.

METHODS: Numerous E1E2 sequences were amplified and sequenced from serum samples collected over a 26-year period from patient H, a uniquely well-characterized, chronically infected individual. HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp) expressing the patient-derived glycoproteins were generated and tested for their sensitivity to neutralization by autologous and heterologous serum antibodies. RESULTS: A strain-specific nAb response developed early in infection (8 weeks postinfection), whereas cross-reactive antibodies able to neutralize HCVpp-bearing heterologous glycoproteins developed late in infection (\u003e33 wk postinfection). The humoral response continuously failed to neutralize viruses bearing autologous glycoprotein sequences that were present in the serum at a given time. The amplified glycoprotein sequences displayed high variability, particularly in regions corresponding to defined linear B-cell epitopes. Mutations in defined neutralizing epitopes were associated with a loss of recognition by monoclonal antibodies against these epitopes and with decreased neutralization of corresponding HCVpp. Viral escape from CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses also was shown for several novel epitopes throughout the glycoprotein region.

Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), but not native LDL, potently inhibited HCVpp and HCVcc cell entry. Pseudoparticles bearing unrelated viral glycoproteins or bovine viral diarrhea virus were not affected.

However, binding of soluble E2 to SR-BI or CD81 was not affected by oxLDL, suggesting that oxLDL does not act as a simple receptor blocker. At the same time, oxLDL incubation altered the biophysical properties of HCVpp, suggesting a ternary interaction of oxLDL with both virus and target cells.

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the ITX compounds inhibit HCV infection with a mechanism of action distinct from other HCV therapies under development. Since ITX 5061 has already been evaluated in over 280 patients with good pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, it warrants proof-of-concept clinical studies in HCV infected patients.","bibo:AuthorList":["Syder, Andrew J","Lee, Haekyung","Zeisel, Mirjam B","Grove, Joe","Soulier, Eric","Macdonald, James","Chow, Stephine","Chang, Julia","Baumert, Thomas","McKeating, Jane A","McKelvy, Jeffrey","Wong-Staal, Flossie"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77078,"sim:weight":0.387897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631115,"sim:weight":0.172835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.083764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0646757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76609,"sim:weight":0.0558227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Precipitation totals and maximum, mean and minimum river flow are analysed at the seasonal scale for 12 and 10 stations, respectively. Pearson’s and Mann-Kendall correlation tests are applied to assess relationships between the NAO index and precipitation and river flow metrics, and to detect trends in time-series. Autumn precipitation totals display significant increasing trends, especially for coastal stations, while inland stations show significant increasing trends for spring precipitation. Minimum and maximum river flow decreases significantly for spring and summer. This tendency implies varying conditions towards a drier regime. Seasonal precipitation patterns show a negative association with the NAO for December–January–February (DJF), March–April–May (MAM) and September–October–November (SON) for some stations. Positive associations between the NAO and winter-extended winter (December–March) river flows are detected for some stations in northeast Turkey.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saris, F.","Hannah, D.

Using such reports as ‘outcomes’ in a multi-stage regression model, it is clear that they are largely unrelated to school-level pupil mix variables. To some extent, these outcomes are stratified by pupil and family background in the same way for all countries. However, the largest association is with pupil reported experience of interactions with their teachers. Teachers appear to be a -major influence on young peoples’ sense of justice, and the principles they apply in deciding whether something is fair.

Monthly total precipitation data are employed for 107 stations (1963–2002). Precipitation regime shape (seasonality) and magnitude (size) are classified using a novel multivariate methodology. Six shape and five magnitude classes are identified, which exhibit clear spatial structure. A composite (shape and magnitude) regime classification reveals dominant controls on spatial variability of precipitation. Intra-annual timing and magnitude of precipitation is highly variable due to seasonal shifts in Polar and Subtropical zones and physiographic factors. Nonetheless, the classification methodology is shown to be a powerful tool that identifies physically-interpretable precipitation regions: (1) coastal regimes for Marmara, coastal Aegean, Mediterranean and Black Sea; (2) transitional regimes in continental Aegean and Southeast Anatolia; and (3) inland regimes across central and Eastern Anatolia.

Organizations such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are currently planning to move towards a climate services paradigm, which will rest heavily on skilful forecasts at seasonal (1 to 9 months) timescales from coupled atmosphere-land-ocean models. We present a careful analysis of the predictive skill of temperature and precipitation from eight seasonal climate forecast models with the joint distribution of observations and forecasts. Using the correlation coefficient, a shift in the conditional distribution of the observations given a forecast can be detected, which determines the usefulness of the forecast for applications. Results suggest there is a deficiency of skill in the forecasts beyond month-1, with precipitation having a more pronounced drop in skill than temperature. At long lead times only the equatorial Pacific Ocean exhibits significant skill. This could have an influence on the planned use of seasonal forecasts in climate services and these results may also be seen as a benchmark of current climate prediction capability using (dynamic) couple models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lavers, David","Luo, Lifeng","Wood, Eric F"],"dc:date":"2009-12-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75564,"sim:weight":0.525679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Spinning processes are efficient in producing such characteristics and there is great flexibility in the process with a relatively low tool cost. The objectives of this investigation are to define the critical working parameters in spinning, show the effects of these factors on product quality characteristics, and to optimize the working parameters. The example used is the conventional spinning of a cylindrical cup. Optimization of the process is undertaken through the use of statistical analysis tools applied to the data produced from three-dimensional finite element simulations of the process. This has been achieved by generating two ‘designs of experiments’.The first identifies the most critical parameters for product formability and the second shows how these critical parameters affect the product quality. The results show that feed rate,relative clearance, and roller nose radius are the most important working parameters and significantly affect average thickness, thickness variation, and springback of the cylindrical cup. An additional 22 per cent improvement in the product quality characteristic is gained through using the optimum working parameters.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hartley, P","Essa, K"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15405,"sim:weight":0.651746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383227,"sim:weight":0.311772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68143,"sim:weight":0.293211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496193,"sim:weight":0.292344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.287285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58759,"sim:weight":0.286911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1384849,"sim:weight":0.279693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.277013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.276063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.270945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43103,"sim:weight":0.268998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101569,"sim:weight":0.267274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890288,"sim:weight":0.255391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.254486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734349,"sim:weight":0.253694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108134,"sim:weight":0.253164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59004,"sim:weight":0.252062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145635,"sim:weight":0.24975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43570,"sim:weight":0.24435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98638,"sim:weight":0.2409,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Both questionnaires are grounded in self-determination theory and are commonly employed in physical education research. \n \nMethod: Secondary school students from the United Kingdom (UK; n \u003d 300, mean age \u003d 13.71) and Hong Kong (HK; n \u003d 342, mean age \u003d 15.34 years) completed both questionnaires prior to a physical education lesson. \nResults: Internal consistency analyses, as well as single and multi-group confirmatory factor analyses produced evidence that largely supported the reliability and validity of PLOCQ and SIMS scores in the UK sample. However, the analyses indicated some areas of concern regarding the internal consistency of the external and introjected regulation PLOCQ items in the HK sample. Also, identified regulation and intrinsic motivation constructs were not distinguishable by youth in either culture in either questionnaire. Finally, compared with the UK, students in HK interpreted the SIMS external regulation items to be more self-determined. \n \nConclusions: Researchers interested in studying contextual and situational motivation in UK physical education classes should, in general, feel confident in using the PLOCQ and the SIMS, respectively. However, our results highlight some important difficulties in the measurement of contextual and situational motivation in HK Chinese students. Further research is needed to better understand how students from different cultures respond to items intended to tap controlling forms of motivation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lonsdale, Chris","Sabiston, Catherine M","Taylor, Ian M.","Ntoumanis, Nikos"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":336531,"sim:weight":0.0823513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Arp2/3 complex has been implicated in lamellipodial actin assembly as a major nucleator of new actin filaments in branched networks. The interplay between filopodial and lamellipodial protrusions is an area of much interest as it is thought to be a key determinant of how cells make motility choices. \n \nResults \nWe find that Arp2/3 complex localises to dynamic puncta in filopodia as well as lamellipodia of spreading cells. Arp2/3 complex spots do not appear to depend on local adhesion or on microtubules for their localisation but their inclusion in filopodia or lamellipodia depends on the activity of the small GTPase Rac1. Arp2/3 complex spots in filopodia are capable of incorporating monomeric actin, suggesting the presence of available filament barbed ends for polymerisation. Arp2/3 complex in filopodia co-localises with lamellipodial proteins such as capping protein and cortactin. The dynamics of Arp2/3 complex puncta suggests that they are moving bi-directionally along the length of filopodia and that they may be regions of lamellipodial activity within the filopodia. \n \nConclusion \nWe suggest that filopodia of spreading cells have regions of lamellipodial activity and that this activity affects the morphology and movement of filopodia.

In multivariate logistic regression, the use of implanted ports as compared with peripherally implanted central venous catheters (PICCs), decreased CRT risk (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23–0.80), whereas past history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.05–3.92), subclavian venipuncture insertion technique (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.07–4.34) and improper catheter tip location (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.22–3.02), increased CRT risk. Conclusions: CRT risk is increased with use of PICCs, previous history of DVT, subclavian venipuncture insertion technique and improper positioning of the catheter tip. These factors may be useful for risk stratifying patients to select those for thromboprophylaxis. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings","bibo:AuthorList":["Saber, W.","Moua, T.","Williams, E.

This paper explores how the new ‘myth’ about the relationship between religion and corruption is based on assumptions not borne out through the evidence. The paper then examines whether a discursive relationship exists instead, and what the significance of such a relationship might be. \r\nBased on a review of several studies of the statistical relationships between religion and corruption, the paper concludes that the evidence for a causal relationship between religion (or type of religion)and either higher or lower levels of corruption is in no way convincing. The methodologies that have been employed thus far are insufficient for proving – one way or another – a causal relationship. This literature is largely quantitative, with a dearth of empirical, fieldwork-based evidence. The results are often contradictory, depending upon which dataset has been used, which raises important methodological issues. The literature is tentative at best, offering comparisons between various datasets and pointing towards possible explanations, sometimes rooted in theory, sometimes not. The data used are often flawed, making the explanations that are advanced problematic. The data are aggregated at the country level; they do not reveal intra-country variations and cannot tell us anything about how individuals’ attitudes towards corruption are formed, the impact of religious (and other socio-cultural influences) on attitude formation, or the ways that individuals condemn or justify corrupt behaviour using the language of religion. \r\nThe paper adds to a growing body of literature that questions whether research is likely to be able to prove a direct causal relationship between religion and corruption – either positive or negative – and certainly not with the methodologies employed so far. It advocates instead pluralistic approaches that privilege qualitative methodologies involving country and individual level empirical research. These would see both corruption and religion as lived experiences, through which morality is constructed and evolves. Such research, it is argued, would enable morality to be (re)injected into the discourse on corruption. Care needs to be taken in doing so: while religious leaders often urge their followers to desist from corrupt behaviour, some religious leaders and organizations are allegedly corrupt, and the common distinction between public and private morality that informs Western discourse may not apply (or may apply in different ways) to attitudes and behaviour in developing countries. Nevertheless, in many parts of the world, religion maintains a stronger hold on people’s values, attitudes and behaviour than democratic institutions, and as such, it remains an important potential source of power.  Therefore, although care needs to be taken in engaging religious teachings and actors in anticorruption discourses and initiatives, this paper argues that doing so may help to shape both academic and policy debates in a more engaging and significant way than the research available to date.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marquette, Heather"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8771855,"sim:weight":0.838942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771854,"sim:weight":0.795796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768775,"sim:weight":0.661754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633034,"sim:weight":0.606719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771852,"sim:weight":0.485628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764265,"sim:weight":0.425929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43701,"sim:weight":0.421983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.41903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771849,"sim:weight":0.408461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771858,"sim:weight":0.395111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76118,"sim:weight":0.380629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43833,"sim:weight":0.37788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75806,"sim:weight":0.374747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8771863,"sim:weight":0.365399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.361945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.351795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.348559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86060,"sim:weight":0.348438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44140,"sim:weight":0.345048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387345,"sim:weight":0.343506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the international conception buttressing the set up of international administrations — I dub it the \"empty-shell\" approach — is still present in certain policy circles. This article aims to analyze this international conception by clarifying how the UN came to impose its authority over the two territories in a very similar process. While the literature on each state-building experiment is vast and com- pelling, few authors have attempted to contrast the two case studies, especially regarding the mental conception informing the governance process of these territories since 1999. This article links the empty-shell approach with the delegitimization process that came to be experi- enced by the UN in both cases. The article describes the international policies put in place by the UN to expand its control over the two terri- tories, a mix of co-option of local elites and the marginalization of the local population. Finally, the article reveals some possible solutions in order to avoid the more blatant difficulties pertaining to state-building conducted from the outside-in.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lemay-Hebert, Nicolas"],"dc:date":"2011-05-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4183829,"sim:weight":0.532972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Civil society and the peace process 2002-2008","bibo:abstract":"As Sri Lanka slid back towards open hostilities in 2006, existing patterns of civil society engagement in peace negotiations came under widespread criticism on the grounds that they had failed to broaden participation and that they had largely excluded civil society organisations (CSOs) that were critical of peace efforts. As peace talks broke down, the need to move beyond a ‘charmed circle’ of Colombo-based peace NGOs and to engage with a ‘broader civil society’ became a perennial refrain from funding agencies. This period was also marked by an increasingly visible confrontation between pro-peace civil society and patriotic nationalist groups mobilising against peace negotiations and international engagement expressed through growing attacks on NGOs in the media and at a number of public events. \r\n \r\nThis chapter explores this complex predicament facing civil society as Sri Lanka returned to war. First, it presents a brief summary of donors’ engagements with civil society during the ceasefire period and describes how the nature and scope of civil society peace work was shaped by the shifting political context. Second, it contrasts donor-backed peace efforts with the more robust campaigns of nationalist civil society groups after 2005. Third, it examines how the changing political climate impacted upon civil society peacebuilding efforts focusing in particular on the way in which pro-peace civil society actors managed the increasingly critical impressions of their work stemming from the domestic political arena. \r\n \r\nDrawing these strands together, the chapter concludes by reflecting on the collective timidity of civil society actors during the ceasefire period and argues that this was an outcome of two interconnecting sets of factors. On the one hand, civil society’s capacity to contribute to political transformation was constrained by its historical relations with the state. These patterns of interaction drove the dynamic relationship between two conflicting civil society arenas – patriotic groups fed off weaknesses in pro-peace civil society while the position of peace groups was further undermined by the success of these nationalist organizations. On the other hand, the approaches to peacebuilding pursued by donors during the ceasefire period encouraged a growing depoliticization and technicalization of civil society peace work which privileged a consensual rather than a politically engaged role for civil society actors. This analysis sees civil society organisations as confronted with a fundamental tension between a cosmopolitan view of politics that saw political change as the outcome of processes of governance reform prompted by extra-governmental actors and a local perception of politics that viewed political progress as a product of changes in government and debates conducted in an arena inhabited exclusively by political parties. Civil society’s efforts to build peace during the ceasefire period involved a perpetual balancing act between asserting liberal models of bottom-up change and reconciling these with an increasingly predominant and countervailing domestic vision of politics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walton, Oliver","Saravanamuttu, Pakiasothy","Goodhand, Jonathan","Spencer, Jonathan","Korf, Benedikt"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98922,"sim:weight":0.362812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.310476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.295132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47461,"sim:weight":0.263197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47546,"sim:weight":0.249823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91023,"sim:weight":0.23014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46875,"sim:weight":0.21491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381990,"sim:weight":0.212787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48648,"sim:weight":0.178372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383318,"sim:weight":0.15422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":281283,"sim:weight":0.146328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the course of six months, the international community proceeded to create two international administrations encompassing legislative, judicial and executive power – in Kosovo and Timor-Leste in 1999. With a specific focus on Kosovo, this paper claims that the limits of this governance scheme lie in the very nature of the mandate. Placed in the situation of a de facto government of Kosovo, the international administration has to face the same requirements that any legitimate government has. Even more complicated was the fact that there were no check-and-balances included in the international framework, granting the international administration with full authority in terms of governance. International administrators found themselves in a ‘legitimacy dilemma:’ everything they do to reinforce their rule actually perpetuates their weakness. Its legitimacy waning, the state-building agenda put forth by the international administrations came to be seen as more exogenous, reinforcing the delegitimization process. This paper attempts to shed light on the specific issues of this governance scheme, while trying in turn to understand the limits of the orthodox conception of statebuilding. This paper will specifically address the influence of the Weberian approach to legitimacy on the statebuilding literature as well as its limits. It will also attempt to chart other possible avenues for statebuilding, more in line with a wider understanding of legitimacy and intervention.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lemay-Hebert, Nicolas"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.25083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.238908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.238908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106931,"sim:weight":0.211535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108938,"sim:weight":0.186609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108611,"sim:weight":0.186605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108556,"sim:weight":0.182669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.149412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108703,"sim:weight":0.129468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

TPEPICO spectra are recorded continuously as a function of photon energy, allowing threshold photoelectron spectra and yields of the fragment ions to be obtained. At fixed photon energies, spectra are also recorded with improved time resolution, allowing total mean translational kinetic energy releases, \u003cKE\u003e\\(_t\\), into some dissociation channels to be determined. By comparing \u003cKE\u003e\\(_t\\) values for single bond-fission processes (i.e. cleavage of a C-Cl or C-X bond) with those predicted for the limiting extremes of a statistical and an impulsive dissociation, information on the nature of the photodissociation dynamics can be inferred. Excited states of all three parent cations show evidence for isolated-state behaviour, and the \u003cKE\u003e\\(_t\\) values suggest a relationship between the part of the molecule where ionisation occurs and the bond that breaks to form daughter ion + neutral atom products ; impulsive values of \u003cKE\u003e\\(_t\\) are more likely to be obtained when the breaking bond lies close to the part of the molecule where ionisation occurs, statistical values when ionisation occurs further away from the breaking bond. At higher photon energies, smaller fragment ions are formed following cleavage of more than one bond. With CCl\\(_3\\)F and CCl\\(_3\\)Br, the appearance energies of the daughter ions are close to the thermochemical energy for production of that ion with isolated neutral atoms, suggesting strongly that these ions form by bond-fission processes only. With CCl\\(_3\\)H, at certain energies some fragment ions can only form with molecular neutral fragments (e.g. CCl\\(_2^+\\) + HCl), involving bond-breaking and bond-making processes. It is suggested that this phenomenon is related to the small size of the hydrogen atom, and hence less steric hindrance in a tightly-constrained transition state along the reaction coordinate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Seccombe, D.

Contrary to the assumption of a static climate in road management approaches, observations over the last 40 or 50 years show increasing trend in global warming. This raises the possibility that the severity and frequency of pavement defects may be altered leading to premature pavement deterioration and increased costs of managing and using roads. As a consequence, current road management strategies and policies may not offer sufficient resilience to increased frequency of future extreme climate events. A study was undertaken at the University of Birmingham to develop improved deterioration model for asphalt rut depth prediction.

Since bottom-up processes favor high saliency, detection of a low-salient target in the presence of highly salient distractors requires top-down attentional guidance. Previous studies have demonstrated that top-down attention can modulate perceptual processing and also that the control of attention is driven by frontoparietal regions. However, to date, there is no direct evidence on the cause and effect relationship between control regions and perceptual processing. Here, we report the first evidence demonstrating a neural circuit for the downregulation of salient distractors when a low-salient target is selected, combining brain imaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging with brain stimulation by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Using these combined techniques, we were able to identify a cause and effect relationship in the suppression of saliency, based on an interaction between the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and a region implicated in visual processing in our task (the left occipital pole). In particular, low-salient stimuli were selected by the left IPS suppressing early visual areas that would otherwise respond to a high-saliency distractor in the task. Apart from providing a first documentation of the neural circuit supporting selection by saliency, these data can be critical for understanding the underlying causes of problems in ignoring irrelevant salience that are found in both acquired and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder or autism).","bibo:AuthorList":["Mevorach, Carmel","Hodsoll, John","Allen, Harriet A.","Shalev, Lilach","Humphreys, Glyn W."],"dc:date":"2010-04-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52909,"sim:weight":0.105299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In a recent TMS study [Mevorach, C., Humphreys, G. W., \u0026 Shalev, L. Opposite biases in salience-based selection for the left and right posterior parietal cortex. Nature Neuroscience, 9, 740-742, 2006b], it was shown that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) can utilize the relative saliency (a nonspatial property) of a target and a distractor to bias visual selection. Furthermore, selection was lateralized so that the right PPC is engaged when salient information must be selected and the left PPC when the salient information must be ignored. However, it is not clear how the PPC implements these complementary forms of selection. Here we used on-line triple-pulse TMS over the right or left PPC prior to or after the onset of global/local displays. When delivered after the onset of the display, TMS to the right PPC disrupted the selection of the more salient aspect of the hierarchical letter. In contrast, left PPC TMS delivered prior to the onset of the stimulus disrupted responses to the lower saliency stimulus. These findings suggest that selection and suppression of saliency, rather than being \"two sides of the same coin,\" are fundamentally different processes. Selection of saliency seems to operate reflexively, whereas suppression of saliency relies on a preparatory phase that \"sets up\" the system in order to effectively ignore saliency.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mevorach, Carmel","Humphreys, Glyn W.","Shalev, Lilach"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":124535,"sim:weight":0.36625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75364,"sim:weight":0.204234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the 1970s and 1980s, a Lacanian psychoanalytic interpretation of identification dominated film theory and criticism, and spectatorial engagement with elements of films was understood as what psychoanalysis calls secondary identification – the identification with stable subject-positions (characters) in the film-text. But non-Lacanian psychoanalysis and Merleau-Ponty’s existential phenomenology offer film-philosophy a very different understanding of identification as a non image-based, ‘blind’, bodily affective tie that is established between spectators and what Vivian Sobchack describes as ‘the sense and sensibility of materiality itself’ (Sobchack 2004, 65). By first exploring how this more bodily (for psychoanalysis, primary) identification is theorized by psychoanalysts (Freud, Paul Schilder, Henri Wallon) and by film theorists (Kaja Silverman), the article proposes that film criticism make greater use of it in order to engage more meaningfully with the visible cultural specificities – size, skin colour, age, sex – of the images of bodies viewed on cinema screens. It is not just ‘the’ body that needs bringing back into thinking about film spectatorship, but culturally differentiated bodies, both on the screen and in the auditorium. A psychoanalytic and phenomenological film criticism of embodied cultural identity, one that attends to the materiality of the film and of the body-images and objects on the screen, may be the most culturally and politically useful successor to ‘screen’ theory of the 1970s and 1980s.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ince, Kate"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46627,"sim:weight":0.564922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446426,"sim:weight":0.542273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17846,"sim:weight":0.529868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634681,"sim:weight":0.528161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99028,"sim:weight":0.523115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.508354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352169,"sim:weight":0.501493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45121,"sim:weight":0.499926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85374,"sim:weight":0.462863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.460457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.457565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85563,"sim:weight":0.4561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.452867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48296,"sim:weight":0.440212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.439783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.434113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.433428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.433412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43177,"sim:weight":0.433274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710213,"sim:weight":0.432741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Drawing from basic needs theory, a sub-theory in the self-determination theory framework (Deci \u0026 Ryan, 2000), this study examined whether changes in vocational dancers’ autonomy, competence and relatedness satisfaction mediated the relationships between changes in the dancers’ perceived autonomy support and burnout over a school year. \r\n \r\nMethod: Dancers (N \u003d 219) enrolled in vocational dance training, completed a questionnaire package tapping the variables of interest at three time points over a 36-week period. Results: SEM indicated that the observed decreases in the dancers’ perceptions of autonomy support positively predicted observed changes in reported basic need satisfaction that occurred over the school year. In turn, increases in the dancers’ global burnout were negatively predicted by changes in satisfaction of the three needs. The three basic needs fully mediated the ‘autonomy supporteglobal burnout’ relationship. When the sub-dimensions of burnout were examined independently, there were inconsistencies in the salience of each basic need. The increases in emotional and physical exhaustion experienced by the dancers over the school year were unrelated to changes in autonomy, competence and relatedness satisfaction. Changes in competence need satisfaction negatively predicted reduced accomplishment. Increases in the dancers’ dance devaluation were negatively predicted by changes in satisfaction of the three needs. \r\n \r\nConclusions: Overall, the tenets of self-determination theory are supported. Findings point to the relevance of promoting and sustaining autonomy supportive training environments if burnout is to be avoided in elite dance settings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Quested, Eleanor","Duda, Joan L"],"dc:date":"2011-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631186,"sim:weight":0.693733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76502,"sim:weight":0.547678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177044,"sim:weight":0.325578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A total of 370 young male soccer players between the ages of 12 and 16 took part in the study (M\u003d14.77). The results showed that perceptions of a task-involvement climate predicted the adoption of mastery approach and mastery avoidance goals, whereas a perceived ego-involving climate was related to performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals. Perceived competence positively correlated to the two approach goals (mastery and performance). Lastly, the mastery-approach orientation positively correlated to life satisfaction and self-esteem; the performance-approach orientation was positively associated with life satisfaction; and the performance-avoidance orientation negatively correlated to self-esteem.

Its double focus is the changing structure of the French family at the end of the twentieth century, considered against key political developments such as the pacte civil de solidarité (PaCS) of November 1999, and the cinematic fantasies in which these structural changes are envisioned. Fable, fantasy or anti-realism mark the endings of Gazon maudit and Pourquoi pas moi?, while sequences of childhood fantasy punctuate the entire length of Ma Vie en rose. No particular theoretical approach to fantasy is preferred, but the conclusion of the paper is that cinema may be a privileged cultural vehicle for politically enabling fantasy, and that the three films discussed demonstrate this where the French family is concerned.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ince, Kate"],"dc:date":"2002-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48286,"sim:weight":0.502551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.479758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383487,"sim:weight":0.479682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46714,"sim:weight":0.475197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46502,"sim:weight":0.47513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43485,"sim:weight":0.472272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382756,"sim:weight":0.466957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45186,"sim:weight":0.454443,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.441313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44738,"sim:weight":0.435685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.432276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99058,"sim:weight":0.428075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46776,"sim:weight":0.425804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643985,"sim:weight":0.425202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.423552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44304,"sim:weight":0.414955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710177,"sim:weight":0.41315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99315,"sim:weight":0.410207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46680,"sim:weight":0.407556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.403222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Considering principles of individual and moral cosmopolitanism together can help to provide greater clarity concerning individual duties in the absence of fully global institutions, as well as clarity on individual obligations of justice in relation to emerging and still-developing trans-state institutions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cabrera, Luis"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46537,"sim:weight":0.511742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44875,"sim:weight":0.496577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.460398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99153,"sim:weight":0.444241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45399,"sim:weight":0.416686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48340,"sim:weight":0.395103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48320,"sim:weight":0.379481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108330,"sim:weight":0.35975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.356649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631263,"sim:weight":0.350483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77596,"sim:weight":0.333263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98910,"sim:weight":0.333194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269859,"sim:weight":0.332215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.332037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76873,"sim:weight":0.332009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.327895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.327895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.322818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.322007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77205,"sim:weight":0.320608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The construction of such a North American Union, if it included even a very thin trans-state citizenship regime, could represent the most significant expansion of individual entitlements in the region since citizenship was extended to former slaves in the United States. With such a possibility as its starting point, this article explores some striking parallels between the mass, legally prohibited movement across boundaries by fugitive slaves in the pre-Civil War period, and that by current unauthorized migrants to the United States. Both were, or are, met on their journeys by historically parallel groups of would-be helpers and hinderers. Their unauthorized movements in both periods serve as important signals of incomplete entitlements or institutional protections. Most crucially, moral arguments for extending fuller entitlements to both groups are shown here to be less distinct than may be prima facie evident, reinforcing the case for expanding and deepening the regional membership regime.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cabrera, Luis"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5090318,"sim:weight":0.513753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.417794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890342,"sim:weight":0.411665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77878,"sim:weight":0.409336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.400513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.377491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.377491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108361,"sim:weight":0.35836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99382,"sim:weight":0.343652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109071,"sim:weight":0.332974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.319802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75773,"sim:weight":0.296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631676,"sim:weight":0.254249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Energy resonance and good Franck-Condon factors connecting the ground electronic state of a reactant neutral molecule to one of its ionic states, at the recombination of the reagent cation, are generally considered to be sufficient for long-range charge-transfer to occur. However, the results from this study imply that good Franck-Condon factors are not critical in determining the efficiency of a long-range charge-transfer. Instead, the results suggest that, in addition to the requirement for energy resonance, the electron taking part in the charge-transfer process must be removed from a molecular orbital which is unshielded from the approaching reagent cation. This enables the cation to exert an influence on the electron at large impact parameters.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jarvis, G. K.","Kennedy, R. A.","Mayhew, C. A.","Tuckett, R.

Anions detected range from atomic species such as H-, F- and Cl- through to heavier polyatomics such as SF\\(_5^-\\), CF\\(_3^-\\) and CH\\(_2\\)Cl\\(^-\\). The majority of anions display a linear dependence of signal with pressure, showing that they arise from unimolecular ion-pair dissociation, generically written as ABC + h\\(v\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) D\\(^-\\) + E\\(^+\\) + neutral(s). In a few cases, the anion signal increases much more rapidly than a linear dependence with pressure, suggesting that anions now form via a multi-step process such as dissociative electron attachment. Cross sections for ion-pair formation can be put on to an absolute scale by calibrating the signal strength with those of F\\(^-\\) from SF\\(_6\\) and CF\\(_4\\), although there are difficulties associated with the determination of H\\(^-\\) cross sections from hydrogen-containing molecules unless this anion is dominant. Following normalisation to total vacuum-UV absorption cross sections (where data are available), quantum yields for anion production are obtained. Cross sections in the range ca. 10\\(^{-23}\\) to 10\\(^{-19}\\) cm\\(^2\\) , and quantum yields in the range ca. 10\\(^{-6}\\) to 10\\(^{-3}\\) are reported. The Review describes the two ion-pair mechanisms of indirect and direct formation and their differing characteristics, and the properties needed for anion formation by dissociative electron attachment. From this huge quantity of data, attempts are made to rationalise the circumstances needed for favourable formation of anions, and which anions have the largest cross section for their formation. Since most anions form indirectly via predissociation of an initially-excited Rydberg state of the parent molecule by an ion-pair continuum, it appears that the dynamics of this curve crossing is the dominant process which determines which anions are formed preferentially. The thermochemistry of the different exit channels and the microscopic properties of the anion formed do not appear to be especially significant. Finally, for the reaction ABC + h\\(v\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) A\\(^-\\) + BC\\(^+\\) , the appearance energy of A\\(^-\\) can be used to determine an upper limit to the bond dissociation energy of AB (to A + BC), or an upper limit to that of ABC\\(^+\\) (to A + BC\\(^+\\)).

Tunable vacuum-UV radiation in the range 8-22 eV from synchrotron sources at either Daresbury, UK or BESSY1, Germany is used to excite the titled molecules. Fluorescence excitation spectra, with undispersed detection of the fluorescence, were recorded at Daresbury with a resolution of 0.1 nm. VUV absorption spectra at a resolution of 0.08 nm, and dispersed emission spectra with an optical resolution of 8 nm were recorded at BESSY1. Action spectra, in which the VUV energy is scanned with detection of the fluorescence at a specific wavelength, were also recorded at BESSY1 with a resolution of 0.3 nm ; appearance energies for production of a particular emitting state of a fragment are then obtained. Using the single-bunch mode of BESSY1, lifetimes of all emitting states that fall in the range ca. 3-80 ns have been measured. The peaks in the VUV absorption spectra of CF\\(_2\\)X\\(_2\\) are assigned to Rydberg transitions. For CF\\(_2\\)H\\(_2\\) below 11 eV, there is good agreement between the absorption and the fluorescence excitation spectra, whereas above 11 eV and for the whole range 8-22 eV for CF\\(_2\\)Cl\\(_2\\) and CF\\(_2\\)Br\\(_2\\) there is little similarity. This suggests that photodissociation to emitting states of fragment species represent minor channels. In the range 8-15 eV, emission is due mainly to CF\\(_2\\) A\\(^1\\)B\\(_1\\) - X\\(^1\\)A\\(_1\\)1 and weakly to CFX A\\(^1\\)A” - X\\(^1\\)A’. These products form by photodissociation of Rydberg states of CF\\(_2\\)X\\(_2\\), and the thresholds for their production therefore relate to energies of the Rydberg states of the parent molecule. For CF\\(_2\\)H\\(_2\\) below 11.8 eV CF\\(_2\\) A\\(^1\\)B\\(_1\\) can only form with H\\(_2\\), whereas for CF\\(_2\\)Cl\\(_2\\) and CF\\(_2\\)Br\\(_2\\) it is not possible to say whether the other products are 2X or X\\(_2\\).

From their appearance energies, there is evidence that, with the exception of CF B \\(^2\\Delta\\) / CF\\(_2\\)H\\(_2\\) where the ground state of HF must form , the excited state of CF, CCl or CH forms in association with three atoms. Our results yield no information whether the three bonds in CF\\(_2\\)X\\(_2\\)* break simultaneously or sequentially. We suggest that the anomalous behaviour of CF\\(_2\\)H\\(_2\\), in forming H-H or H-F bonds in unimolecular photofragmentation processes, relates to the small size of the hydrogen atom, and hence the unimportance of steric effects in the tightly-constrained transition state.

The ions are separated by a linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Coincidence spectra are recorded continuously as a function of energy, allowing threshold photoelectron spectra and yields of the fragment ions to be obtained. At fixed photon energies, spectra are recorded with improved time resolution, allowing the mean total translational kinetic energy, \u003cKE\u003e\\(_t\\), into some dissociation channels to be determined. By comparing the \u003cKE\u003e\\(_t\\), values for single-bond fragmentations with those predicted for the limiting extremes of a statistical and an impulsive dissociation, information on the nature of the photodissociation dynamics can be inferred. The excited states of all three parent cations show some evidence for isolated-state behaviour.

Through a reading of John Tyndall’s “Discourse on the Scientific Use of the Imagination,” I argue that form is the means through which scientists imagined what they did not know, substituting system and structure for the unordered abundance of the natural world. Journalism, oriented towards an equally complex and changing world, similarly attempts to represent it as ordered and knowable. The orientation of titles towards particularly newsworthy institutions acts as a filter, identifying certain types of information at the expense of countless others, and the organization of publications into sections allocates space for events to be reported even before they occur.

All patients were tested for chronic viral hepatitis thereby providing an opportunity to compare various strategies for detection of this serious treatable disease. \n \nMethods \nThis study uses data from the BALLETS cohort to compare various testing strategies for viral hepatitis in patients who had received an abnormal LFT result. The aim was to inform a strategy for identification of patients with chronic viral hepatitis. We used a cost-minimisation analysis to define a base case and then calculated the incremental cost per case detected to inform a strategy that could guide testing for chronic viral hepatitis. \n \nResults \nOf the 1,236 study patients with an abnormal LFT, 13 had chronic viral hepatitis (nine hepatitis B and four hepatitis C). The strategy advocated by the current guidelines (repeating the LFT with a view to testing for specific disease if it remained abnormal) was less efficient (more expensive per case detected) than a simple policy of testing all patients for viral hepatitis without repeating LFTs. A more selective strategy of viral testing all patients for viral hepatitis if they were born in countries where viral hepatitis was prevalent provided high efficiency with little loss of sensitivity. A notably high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level (greater than twice the upper limit of normal) on the initial ALT test had high predictive value, but was insensitive, missing half the cases of viral infection. \n \nConclusions \nBased on this analysis and on widely accepted clinical principles, a \"fast and frugal\" heuristic was produced to guide general practitioners with respect to diagnosing cases of viral hepatitis in asymptomatic patients with abnormal LFTs. It recommends testing all patients where a clear clinical indication of infection is present (e.g. evidence of intravenous drug use), followed by testing all patients who originated from countries where viral hepatitis is prevalent, and finally testing those who have a notably raised ALT level (more than twice the upper limit of normal). Patients not picked up by this efficient algorithm had a risk of chronic viral hepatitis that is lower than the general population.","bibo:AuthorList":["Arnold, David T","Bentham, Louise M","Jacob, Ruth P","Lilford, Richard J","Girling, Alan J"],"dc:date":"2011-03-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99279,"sim:weight":0.361086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4193257,"sim:weight":0.247362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

No common genetic defects have been described but it is accepted that chronic inflammation is an important contributing factor. We have shown that primary human cholangiocyte and hepatocyte survival is tightly regulated via co-operative interactions between two tumour necrosis family (TNF) receptor family members; CD40 and Fas (CD95). Functional deficiency of CD154, the ligand for CD40, leads to a failure of clearance of biliary tract infections and a predisposition to cholangiocarcinoma implying a direct link between TNF receptor-mediated apoptosis and the development of cholangiocarcinoma. \n \nAims \nTo determine whether malignant cholangiocytes display defects in CD40 mediated apoptosis. By comparing CD40 and Fas-mediated apoptosis and intracellular signalling in primary human cholangiocytes and three cholangiocyte cell lines. \n \nResults \nPrimary cholangiocytes and cholangiocyte cell lines were relatively insensitive to direct Fas-mediated killing with exogenous FasL when compared with Jurkat cells, which readily underwent Fas-mediated apoptosis, but were extremely sensitive to CD154 stimulation. The sensitivity of cells to CD40 activation was similar in magnitude in both primary and malignant cells and was STAT-3 and AP-1 dependent in both. \n \nConclusions \n1) Both primary and malignant cholangiocytes are relatively resistant to Fas–mediated killing but show exquisite sensitivity to CD154, suggesting that the CD40 pathway is intact and fully functional in both primary and malignant cholangiocytes 2) The relative insensitivity of cholangiocytes to Fas activation demonstrates the importance of CD40 augmentation of Fas dependent death in these cells.

Excess protoporphyrin gives rise to the cutaneous photosensitivity characteristic of the disease, and in a minority of patients leads to end-stage liver disease necessitating liver transplantation (LT). There is limited information regarding the timing, impact and long-term outcome of LT in such patients, thus we aimed to identify the indications and outcomes of all transplants performed for EPP in the UK using data from the UK Transplant Registry. Between 1987 and 2009, five patients underwent LT for EPP liver disease. Median follow-up was 60 months, and there were two deaths at 44 and 95 months from causes unrelated to liver disease. The remaining recipients are alive at 22.4 years, 61 months and 55 months after transplant. A high rate of postoperative biliary stricturing requiring multiple biliary interventions was observed. Recurrent EPP-liver disease occurred in 4/5 (80%) of patients but graft failure has not been observed. Given the role of biliary obstruction in inducing EPP-mediated liver damage, we suggest that consideration should be given for construction of a Roux loop at the time of transplant. Thus we demonstrate that although EPP liver transplant recipients have a good long-term survival, comparable to patients undergoing LT for other indications, biliary complications and disease recurrence are almost universal, and bone marrow transplantation should be considered where possible.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dowman, Joanna K.","Gunson, Briget K.","Mirza, Darius F.","Badminton, Mike N.","Newsome, Philip N."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The impact of heatwaves is often felt strongest in towns and cities where populations are concentrated and where the climate is often unintentionally modified to produce an urban heat island effect; where urban areas can be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. The purpose of this interdisciplinary study is to integrate remotely sensed urban heat island data alongside commercial social segmentation data via a spatial risk assessment methodology in order to highlight potential heat health risk areas and build the foundations for a climate change risk assessment. This paper uses the city of Birmingham, UK as a case study area. \nResults \nWhen looking at vulnerable sections of the population, the analysis identifies a concentration of \"very high\" risk areas within the city centre, and a number of pockets of \"high risk\" areas scattered throughout the conurbation. Further analysis looks at household level data which yields a complicated picture with a considerable range of vulnerabilities at a neighbourhood scale. \nConclusions \nThe results illustrate that a concentration of \"very high\" risk people live within the urban heat island, and this should be taken into account by urban planners and city centre environmental managers when considering climate change adaptation strategies or heatwave alert schemes. The methodology has been designed to be transparent and to make use of powerful and readily available datasets so that it can be easily replicated in other urban areas.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tomlinson, Charlie J","Chapman, Lee","Thornes, John E","Baker, Christopher J"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We examine how the composition of the apatite phase affects the reaction with ammonia. For the silicate series, the results showed a small degree of N incorporation at 600○C, while at higher temperatures (800○C), substantial N incorporation was observed. For the germanate series, partial decomposition was observed after heating in ammonia at 800○C, while at the lower temperature (600○C), significant N incorporation was observed. For both series, the N content in the resulting apatite oxynitride was shown to increase with increasing interstitial oxide ion content (x) in the starting oxide. The results suggest that the driving force for the nitridation process is to remove the interstitial anion content, such that for the silicates the total anion (O+N) content in the oxynitrides approximates to 26.0, the value for an anion stoichiometric apatite. For the germanates, lower total anion contents are observed in some cases, consistent with the ability of the germanates to accommodate anion vacancies. The removal of the mobile interstitial oxide ions on nitridation suggests problems with the use of apatite-type electrolytes in SOFCs utilising NH3 at elevated temperatures.","bibo:AuthorList":["Orera, A","Headspith, D","Apperley, D.C.","Francesconi, M.G.","Slater, P.R."],"dc:date":"2009-10-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631240,"sim:weight":0.298935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Despite best current management, PA is associated with severe neurological sequelae, in particular movement disorders resulting from basal ganglia infarction, although the pathogenesis remains poorly understood. The role of liver transplantation remains controversial but may confer some neuro-protection. The present study utilises quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate brain metabolite alterations in propionic acidaemia during metabolic stability and acute encephalopathic episodes. \n \nMethods \nQuantitative MRS was used to evaluate brain metabolites in eight children with neonatal onset propionic acidaemia, with six elective studies acquired during metabolic stability and five studies during acute encephalopathic episodes. MRS studies were acquired concurrently with clinically indicated MR imaging studies at 1.5 Tesla. LCModel software was used to provide metabolite quantification. Comparison was made with a dataset of MRS metabolite concentrations from a cohort of children with normal appearing MR imaging. \n \nResults \nMRI findings confirm the vulnerability of basal ganglia to infarction during acute encephalopathy. We identified statistically significant decreases in basal ganglia glutamate+glutamine and N-Acetylaspartate, and increase in lactate, during encephalopathic episodes. In white matter lactate was significantly elevated but other metabolites not significantly altered. Metabolite data from two children who had received liver transplantation were not significantly different from the comparator group. \n \nConclusions \nThe metabolite alterations seen in propionic acidaemia in the basal ganglia during acute encephalopathy reflect loss of viable neurons, and a switch to anaerobic respiration. The decrease in glutamine + glutamate supports the hypothesis that they are consumed to replenish a compromised Krebs cycle and that this is a marker of compromised aerobic respiration within brain tissue. Thus there is a need for improved brain protective strategies during acute metabolic decompensations. MRS provides a non-invasive tool for which could be employed to evaluate novel treatments aimed at restoring basal ganglia homeostasis. The results from the liver transplantation sub-group supports the hypothesis that liver transplantation provides systemic metabolic stability by providing a hepatic pool of functional propionyl CoA carboxylase, thus preventing further acute decompensations which are associated with the risk of brain infarction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davison, James E","Davies, Nigel P","Wilson, Martin","Sun, Yu","Chakrapani, Anupam","McKiernan, Patrick J","Walter, John H","Gissen, P","Peet, Andrew C"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77272,"sim:weight":0.193494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76856,"sim:weight":0.147654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This report identifies the lymphocyte subsets that produce IFNγ early in Salmonella infection. \n \nMethodology \nIntracellular cytokine staining was used to identify IFNγ production in blood lymphocyte subsets of ten healthy adults with antibodies to Salmonella (as evidence of immunity to Salmonella), in response to stimulation with live and heat-killed preparations of the D23580 invasive African isolate of Salmonella Typhimurium. The absolute number of IFNγ-producing cells in innate, innate-like and adaptive lymphocyte subpopulations was determined. \n \nPrincipal Findings \nEarly IFNγ production was found in the innate/innate-like lymphocyte subsets: γδ-T cells, NK cells and NK-like T cells. Significantly higher percentages of such cells produced IFNγ compared to adaptive αβ-T cells (Student\u0027s t test, P\u003c0.001 and ≤0.02 for each innate subset compared, respectively, with CD4+- and CD8+-T cells). The absolute numbers of IFNγ-producing cells showed similar differences. The proportion of IFNγ-producing γδ-T cells, but not other lymphocytes, was significantly higher when stimulated with live compared with heat-killed bacteria (P\u003c0.0001). \n \nConclusion/Significance \nOur findings indicate an inherent capacity of innate/innate-like lymphocyte subsets to produce IFNγ early in the response to Salmonella infection. This may serve to control intracellular infection and reduce the threat of extracellular spread of disease with bacteremia which becomes life-threatening in the absence of protective antibody. These innate cells may also help mitigate against the effect on IFNγ production of depletion of Salmonella-specific CD4+-T lymphocytes in HIV infection.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nyirenda, Tonney S.","Seeley, Anna E.","Mandala, Wilson L.","Drayson, Mark T.","MacLennan, Calman A."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19329,"sim:weight":0.532914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26476,"sim:weight":0.365463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75424,"sim:weight":0.350215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.33589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77207,"sim:weight":0.329238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76322,"sim:weight":0.314704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10887,"sim:weight":0.308394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76329,"sim:weight":0.258493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75828,"sim:weight":0.250495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77087,"sim:weight":0.247253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.244153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631497,"sim:weight":0.24176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.240019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631138,"sim:weight":0.239541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.233974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The article uses a conjectural framework to study the impact of the national ‘democratic milieu’ on the relationship between network governance and representative institutions in four European countries - the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Denmark. The article shows that the distinction between majoritarian and consensus democracy, as well as the varying strength of voluntary associations are important contextual factors that help understand cross-national differences in the relationship between governance networks and representative institutions. We conclude that a context of weak associationalism in majoritarian democracies facilitates the instrumentalization of networks by governmental actors (United Kingdom), whereas while in consensus democracies a more complementary role of governance networks prevails (Switzerland). However, in consensus democracies characterised by a context of strong associationalism (the Netherlands and Denmark), the spread of governance networks in public policy-making is likely to lead to more substantial transformations of the democratic processes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skelcher, Chris","Klijn, Erik-Hans","Kubler, Daniel","Sorensen, Eva","Sullivan, Helen"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86062,"sim:weight":0.246295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106931,"sim:weight":0.228043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85586,"sim:weight":0.215511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.166827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.166827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As a result, questions of governance are particularly important. Here, governance refers to the rules that prescribe who should make, execute and be accountable for the conduct of a PPP, and in what way that conduct should be exercised, for example through consultation with interested parties, transparency in decision-making, and so on. This chapter explores four facets of PPP governance: legal, regulatory, democratic, and corporate governance. Legal governance has implications for the allocation of roles and responsibilities between the parties to the PPP, the PPP entity itself, and the state and citizens more widely. Regulatory governance covers the legal and contractual obligations on parties, the procedures through which they are enforced, and the softer norms that operate around these. Democratic governance concerns the empirical and normative question of what is, and what should be, the level and form of constitutional oversight of PPPs. Corporate governance concerns itself with ensuring that the enterprise is managed in a manner that does not put the future of the business and investors funds at undue risk. The chapter concludes that the key task in developing the governance of PPPs is less to do with their financial probity, and more with aligning their mode of operating to the fundamental democratic values of the wider public service.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skelcher, Chris"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Networks, then, are not defined by frequency of interactions between actors but by sharing of and contest between different clusters of ideas, theories and normative orientations (discourses) in relation to the specific context within which actors operate. A discourse comprises an ensemble of ideas, concepts and causal theories that give meaning to and reproduce ways of understanding the world (Chouliaraki and Fairclough 1999). Consequently, network governance can be understood as the inherently political process through which discourses are produced, reproduced and transformed. Democratic network governance thus becomes the study of the way in which the core challenges of democratic practice are addressed – how is legitimacy awarded, by what mechanisms are decisions reached, and how is accountability enabled. Three approaches to the discursive analysis of democracy in network governance are considered - argumentation analysis, inter-subjectivity, and critical discourse analysis – and their implications for the study of intergovernmental relations and multi-level governance (IGR/MLG) are discussed. Case examples are provided. We conclude that the value for the study of MLG/IGR is to complement existing forms of analysis by opening up the communicative and ideational aspects of interactions between levels of government and other actors.","bibo:AuthorList":["farrelly, michael","jeffares, stephen","skelcher, chris"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.535983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.521592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.489086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77205,"sim:weight":0.468653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.462379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.462379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109122,"sim:weight":0.453617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76513,"sim:weight":0.430076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77543,"sim:weight":0.287345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However collaborative working presents a new problem for policy makers and public management researchers. The problem is to design an institutional framework for the governance of economic development that provides for anchorage in the democratic system without loosing the benefits of flexible policy design and delivery. This is particularly important in a European context. The European Union has recognised the need for citizens to be more engaged in the governance of public policy at all scales - from local neighbourhoods to the transnational level. This chapter addresses the problem by examining the basic questions that any form of democratic governance design needs to address, and relating this to the case of economic development. The core democratic design questions are: How can legitimacy be secured? In what ways can relevant publics give consent to decisions? Through what means can the institution be held to account? The chapter discusses these three democratic imperatives and shows that different responses to these produce three archetypical governance designs - club, agency and polity. We then explore the way in which the problems of democratic governance have been solved empirically through longitudinal case studies of the expansion of Mainport Rotterdam and the management of economic, environmental, residential and transportation agendas in the Ghent canal area of the Flanders region of Belgium. The analysis shows that although different national and regional political contexts matter, the typology of archetypes offers a way of understanding the overall democratic orientation of a particular governance design as well as offering a basis from which policy makers can create their own solutions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skelcher, Chris","De rynck, Filip","Klijn, Erik-Hans","Voets, Joris","Considine, Mark","Giguere, Sylvain"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":106931,"sim:weight":0.528856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77832,"sim:weight":0.496671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76162,"sim:weight":0.491034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.490254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76373,"sim:weight":0.42043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.415072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.415072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76300,"sim:weight":0.40829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Targeted gene knockouts confirmed the role of these clusters in biosynthesis of the two separate components, pseudomonic acid and the pyrrothine, and identified a putative amide synthetase that joins them together. Feeding mupirocin to a mutant unable to make the endogenous pseudomonic acid created a novel hybrid with the pyrrothine via “mutasynthesis” that allows inhibition of mupirocin-resistant isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, the mupirocin target. A mutant defective in pyrrothine biosynthesis was also able to incorporate alternative amine substrates. \n \nConclusions/Significance \nPlasmid pTML1 provides a paradigm for combining independent antibiotic biosynthetic pathways or using mutasynthesis to develop a new family of hybrid derivatives that may extend the effective use of mupirocin against MRSA.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fukuda, Daisuke","Haines, Anthony S.","Song, Zhongshu","Murphy, Annabel C.","Hothersall, Joanne","Stephens, Elton R.","Gurney, Rachel","Cox, Russell J.","Crosby, John","Willis, Christine L.","Simpson, Thomas J.","Thomas, Christopher M."],"dc:date":"2011-03-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45570,"sim:weight":0.440662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45241,"sim:weight":0.404568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44537,"sim:weight":0.369245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.365751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5229128,"sim:weight":0.35213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46512,"sim:weight":0.342795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.327211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45631,"sim:weight":0.321203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99353,"sim:weight":0.316754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.31096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77058,"sim:weight":0.308254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.29767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1390521,"sim:weight":0.297391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.287437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632019,"sim:weight":0.281687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826716,"sim:weight":0.273513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.269752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225621,"sim:weight":0.265862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98866,"sim:weight":0.262832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709941,"sim:weight":0.26265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A box model has previously been demonstrated to model the observed daytime chemistry well. However the box model is unable to explain the nocturnal measurements of relatively high [NO] and [O3], but relatively low observed [NO2]. It is shown that a one-dimensional (1-D) column model with simple O3 -NOx chemistry and a simple representation of vertical transport is able to explain the observed nocturnal concentrations and predict the likely vertical profiles of these species in the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL). Concentrations of tracers carried over from the end of the night can affect the atmospheric chemistry of the following day. To ascertain the anomaly introduced by using the box model to represent the NBL, vertically-averaged NBL concentrations at the end of the night are compared between the 1-D model and the box model. It is found that, under low to medium [NOx] conditions (NOx \u003c1 ppbv), a simple parametrisation can be used to modify the box model deposition velocity of ozone, in order to achieve good agreement between the box and 1-D models for these end-of-night concentrations of NOx and O3. This parametrisation would could also be used in global climate-chemistry models with limited vertical resolution near the surface. Box-model results for the following day differ significantly if this effective nocturnal deposition velocity for ozone is implemented; for instance, there is a 9% increase in the following day’s peak ozone concentration. However under medium to high [NOx] conditions (NOx \u003e 1 ppbv), the effect on the chemistry due to the vertical distribution of the species means no box model can adequately represent chemistry in the NBL without modifying reaction rate constants.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pugh, Thomas A.

The first one, an “institutional approach” closely related to the Weberian conception of the state, focuses on the importance of institutional reconstruction and postulates that state-building activities do not necessarily require a concomitant nation-building effort. The second, a “legitimacy approach” influenced by Durkheimian sociology, recognizes the need to consolidate central state institutions, but puts more emphasis on the importance of socio-political cohesion in the process. The institutional approach focuses on the institutional and physical basis of the state, while the legitimacy approach is more preoccupied with the social contract binding the citizens together. This contemporary debate has practical implications for practitioners in the field of state-building. Indeed, one’s conception of what to rebuild – the state – will necessarily impact the actual process of state-building. This paper tries to bring some clarity to a very confused debate, detailing the rise of the institutional approach and its limits when faced with unforeseen legitimacy issues.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lemay-Hebert, Nicolas"],"dc:date":"2010-04-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The molecular mechanisms underlying structural robustness and plasticity are poorly understood, but can be investigated by probing how cells respond to injury. Injury to the CNS induces proliferation of enwrapping glia, leading to axonal re-enwrapment and partial functional recovery. This glial regenerative response is found across species, and may reflect a common underlying genetic mechanism. Here, we show that injury to the Drosophila larval CNS induces glial proliferation, and we uncover a gene network controlling this response. It consists of the mutual maintenance between the cell cycle inhibitor Prospero (Pros) and the cell cycle activators Notch and NFκB. Together they maintain glia in the brink of dividing, they enable glial proliferation following injury, and subsequently they exert negative feedback on cell division restoring cell cycle arrest. Pros also promotes glial differentiation, resolving vacuolization, enabling debris clearance and axonal enwrapment. Disruption of this gene network prevents repair and induces tumourigenesis. Using wound area measurements across genotypes and time-lapse recordings we show that when glial proliferation and glial differentiation are abolished, both the size of the glial wound and neuropile vacuolization increase. When glial proliferation and differentiation are enabled, glial wound size decreases and injury-induced apoptosis and vacuolization are prevented. The uncovered gene network promotes regeneration of the glial lesion and neuropile repair. In the unharmed animal, it is most likely a homeostatic mechanism for structural robustness. This gene network may be of relevance to mammalian glia to promote repair upon CNS injury or disease.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kato, Kentaro","Forero, Manuel G.","Fenton, Janine C.","Hidalgo, Alicia"],"dc:date":"2011-08-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19304,"sim:weight":0.276339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4881258,"sim:weight":0.268052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4868987,"sim:weight":0.22773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.212377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154246,"sim:weight":0.209037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48467,"sim:weight":0.198893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184258,"sim:weight":0.198644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768466,"sim:weight":0.196726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5230396,"sim:weight":0.186301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46577,"sim:weight":0.182677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.175896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.171988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.162904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.162018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.16096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.152855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385391,"sim:weight":0.14989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184423,"sim:weight":0.140918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710361,"sim:weight":0.140082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709926,"sim:weight":0.136092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Biosynthesis of AG and LAM involves a series of membrane-embedded arabinofuranosyl (Araf) transferases whose structures are largely uncharacterised, despite the fact that several of them are pharmacological targets of ethambutol, a frontline drug in tuberculosis therapy. Herein, we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of the ethambutol-sensitive Araf transferase M. tuberculosis EmbC, which is essential for LAM synthesis. The structure of the C-terminal domain of EmbC (EmbCCT) encompasses two sub-domains of different folds, of which subdomain II shows distinct similarity to lectin-like carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM). Co-crystallisation with a cell wall-derived di-arabinoside acceptor analogue and structural comparison with ligand-bound CBMs suggest that EmbCCT contains two separate carbohydrate binding sites, associated with subdomains I and II, respectively. Single-residue substitution of conserved tryptophan residues (Trp868, Trp985) at these respective sites inhibited EmbC-catalysed extension of LAM. The same substitutions differentially abrogated binding of di- and penta-arabinofuranoside acceptor analogues to EmbCCT, linking the loss of activity to compromised acceptor substrate binding, indicating the presence of two separate carbohydrate binding sites, and demonstrating that subdomain II indeed functions as a carbohydrate-binding module. This work provides the first step towards unravelling the structure and function of a GT-C-type glycosyltransferase that is essential in M. tuberculosis. Author Summary Top Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis, burdens large swaths of the world population. Treatment of active TB typically requires administration of an antibiotic cocktail over several months that includes the drug ethambutol. This front line compound inhibits a set of arabinosyltransferase enzymes, called EmbA, EmbB and EmbC, which are critical for the synthesis of arabinan, a vital polysaccharide in the pathogen\u0027s unique cell envelope. How precisely ethambutol inhibits arabinosyltransferase activity is not clear, in part because structural information of its pharmacological targets has been elusive. Here, we report the high-resolution structure of the C-terminal domain of the ethambutol-target EmbC, a 390-amino acid fragment responsible for acceptor substrate recognition. Combining the X-ray crystallographic analysis with structural comparisons, site-directed mutagenesis, activity and ligand binding assays, we identified two regions in the C-terminal domain of EmbC that are capable of binding acceptor substrate mimics and are critical for activity of the full-length enzyme. Our results begin to define structure-function relationships in a family of structurally uncharacterised membrane-embedded glycosyltransferases, which are an important target for tuberculosis therapy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alderwick, Luke J.","Lloyd, Georgina S.","Ghadbane, Hemza","May, John W.","Bhatt, Apoorva","Eggeling, Lothar","Fütterer, Klaus","Besra, Gurdyal S."],"dc:date":"2011-02-24","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19306,"sim:weight":0.502954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19328,"sim:weight":0.45625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19004,"sim:weight":0.42353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185139,"sim:weight":0.393804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26920,"sim:weight":0.385953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145166,"sim:weight":0.370254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890319,"sim:weight":0.369748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1585857,"sim:weight":0.345661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6199825,"sim:weight":0.338542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154366,"sim:weight":0.33515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.333814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47262,"sim:weight":0.333723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9020578,"sim:weight":0.332544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.32914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98533,"sim:weight":0.319185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387023,"sim:weight":0.311214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98773,"sim:weight":0.299896,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.29608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23622,"sim:weight":0.295474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44252,"sim:weight":0.283604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Non-lytic escape is also exhibited by some bacterial pathogens and is likely to facilitate long-term avoidance of the host immune system during latency. Here we show that phagosomes containing intracellular cryptococci undergo repeated cycles of actin polymerisation. These actin ‘flashes’ occur in both murine and human macrophages and are dependent on classical WASP-Arp2/3 complex mediated actin filament nucleation. Three dimensional confocal imaging time lapse revealed that such flashes are highly dynamic actin cages that form around the phagosome. Using fluorescent dextran as a phagosome membrane integrity probe, we find that the non-lytic expulsion of Cryptococcus occurs through fusion of the phagosome and plasma membranes and that, prior to expulsion, 95% of phagosomes become permeabilised, an event that is immediately followed by an actin flash. By using pharmacological agents to modulate both actin dynamics and upstream signalling events, we show that flash occurrence is inversely related to cryptococcal expulsion, suggesting that flashes may act to temporarily inhibit expulsion from infected phagocytes. In conclusion, our data reveal the existence of a novel actin-dependent process on phagosomes containing cryptococci that acts as a potential block to expulsion of Cryptococcus and may have significant implications for the dissemination of, and CNS invasion by, this organism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnston, Simon A.","May, Robin C."],"dc:date":"2010-08-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":10841,"sim:weight":0.446497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77294,"sim:weight":0.411945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75828,"sim:weight":0.34728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77087,"sim:weight":0.320543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75373,"sim:weight":0.239944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631461,"sim:weight":0.195502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76737,"sim:weight":0.193314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75685,"sim:weight":0.17099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.165487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75818,"sim:weight":0.161139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.146965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.141143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.139497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25902,"sim:weight":0.137545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76122,"sim:weight":0.132482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76202,"sim:weight":0.121978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.121772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A graphical user interface provides easy access to all steps of data processing via a script builder to generate MATLAB scripts, providing an option to alter code manually. The analysis of two-dimensional spectra (1H,13C-HSQC spectra) is facilitated by the use of a spectral library derived from publicly available databases which can be extended readily. The software allows to display specific metabolites in small regions of interest where signals can be picked. To facilitate the analysis of series of two-dimensional spectra, different spectra can be overlaid and assignments can be transferred between spectra. The software includes mechanisms to account for overlapping signals by highlighting neighboring and ambiguous assignments.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThe MetaboLab software is an integrated software package for NMR data processing and analysis, closely linked to the previously developed NMRLab software. It includes tools for batch processing and gives access to a wealth of algorithms available in the MATLAB framework.

EBV is so markedly B-lymphotropic when exposed to human lymphocytes in vitro that the association of EBV with rare but distinct types of T and NK cell lymphoproliferations was quite unexpected. Whilst relatively rare, these EBV-associated T and NK lymphoproliferations can be therapeutically challenging and prognosis for the majority of patients is dismal.

It requires two basic conditions to be satisfied: 1) agents are versatile enough to perform more than one single functional role within a system and 2) agents are degenerate, i.e. there exists partial overlap in the functional capabilities of agents. Given these prerequisites, degenerate systems can readily produce a distributed systemic response to local perturbations. Reciprocally, excess resources related to a single function can indirectly support multiple unrelated functions within a degenerate system. In models of genome:proteome mappings for which localized decision-making and modularity of genetic functions are assumed, we verify that such distributed compensatory effects cause enhanced robustness of system traits. The conditions needed for networked buffering to occur are neither demanding nor rare, supporting the conjecture that degeneracy may fundamentally underpin distributed robustness within several biotic and abiotic systems. For instance, networked buffering offers new insights into systems engineering and planning activities that occur under high uncertainty. It may also help explain recent developments in understanding the origins of resilience within complex ecosystems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Whitacre, James M","Bender, Axel"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Two consecutive one-week air quality monitoring campaigns were conducted at seven school sampling sites, reflecting roadside and urban background in London. Chemical characteristics of size fractionated particulate matter (PM) samples were related to the capacity to drive biological oxidation reactions in a synthetic respiratory tract lining fluid. Contrary to hypothesised contrasts in particulate OP between school site types, no robust size-fractionated differences in OP were identified due high temporal variability in concentrations of PM components over the one-week sampling campaigns. For OP assessed both by ascorbate (OPAA m−3) and glutathione (OPGSH m−3) depletion, the highest OP per cubic metre of air was in the largest size fraction, PM1.9–10.2. However, when expressed per unit mass of particles OPAA µg−1 showed no significant dependence upon particle size, while OPGSH µg−1 had a tendency to increase with increasing particle size, paralleling increased concentrations of Fe, Ba and Cu. The two OP metrics were not significantly correlated with one another, suggesting that the glutathione and ascorbate depletion assays respond to different components of the particles. Ascorbate depletion per unit mass did not show the same dependence as for GSH and it is possible that other trace metals (Zn, Ni, V) or organic components which are enriched in the finer particle fractions, or the greater surface area of smaller particles, counter-balance the redox activity of Fe, Ba and Cu in the coarse particles. Further work with longer-term sampling and a larger suite of analytes is advised in order to better elucidate the determinants of oxidative potential, and to fuller explore the contrasts between site types.","bibo:AuthorList":["Godri, Krystal J.","Harrison, Roy M.","Evans, Tim","Baker, Timothy","Dunster, Christina","Mudway, Ian S.","Kelly, Frank J."],"dc:date":"2011-07-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":75677,"sim:weight":0.311069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24791,"sim:weight":0.284612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.281949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.279854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76613,"sim:weight":0.272797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77276,"sim:weight":0.218825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Melatonin is synthesised and secreted during the night by the pineal gland and released into the circulatory system. It binds to numerous membrane, cytosolic and nuclear receptors in the brain and peripheral organs. Three G-protein linked membrane receptors (Mel-1A, Mel-1B and Mel-1C) have been identified in numerous species. Considering the importance of this hormone and its receptors, this study looks at the location and rhythmicity of three avian melatonin receptors Mel-1A, Mel-1B and Mel-1C using reserve transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) mRNA analysis techniques. This study shows successful partial cloning of the three receptors and gene expression analysis revealed significant rhythms of the Mel-1A receptor in the cerebellum, diencephalon, tectum opticum, telencephalon, and retina. Significant rhythms where found in the diencephalon, pineal gland, retina, tectum opticum and cerebellum of the Mel-1B receptor whereas Mel-1C appeared not to be rhythmically expressed in brain tissues studied. Mel-1A, Mel-1B and Mel-1C receptor mRNA where also present in peripheral tissues showing tissue-specific expression patterns.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Catherine","Helfer, Gisela","Brandstaetter, Roland"],"dc:date":"2012-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.252878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.206376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26719,"sim:weight":0.186498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.182194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77036,"sim:weight":0.177975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75373,"sim:weight":0.176625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75939,"sim:weight":0.173254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.169214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77267,"sim:weight":0.165129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25913,"sim:weight":0.160998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.155751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.151643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75804,"sim:weight":0.147932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26779,"sim:weight":0.14491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.14481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Patients do not always choose to accept preventive medication at levels of risk reduction recommended in guidelines. The purpose of the study was to identify and explore the attitudes of patients and general practitioners towards preventative medication for cardiovascular disease (CVD) after they have received information about it; to identify implications for practice and prescribing. \r\n\r\nMethods\r\nQualitative interviews with GPs and patients following presentation of in depth information about CVD risks and the absolute effects of medication. Setting: GP practices in Birmingham, United Kingdom. \r\n\r\nResults\r\nIn both populations: wide variation on attitudes to preventative medication; concerns about unnecessary drug taking \u0026 side effects; preferring to consider lifestyle changes first. In patient population: whatever their attitudes to medication were, the vast majority explained that they would ultimately do what their GP recommended; there was some misunderstanding of the distinction between curative and preventative medication. A common theme was the degree of trust in their doctors\u0027 judgement and recommendations, which contrasted with scepticism of the role of pharmaceutical companies and academics. Scepticism in guidelines was also common among doctors although many nevertheless recommended treatment for their patients \r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nA guideline approach to prescribing preventative medication could be against the interests and preferences of the patient. GPs must take extra care to explain what preventative medication is and why it is recommended, attempt to discern preferences and make recommendations balancing these potentially conflicting concerns.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gale, Nicola K","Greenfield, Sheila","Gill, Paramjit","Gutridge, Kerry","Marshall, Tom"],"dc:date":"2011-06-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.559051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.457247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24815,"sim:weight":0.406065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.374647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.374647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We report on a qualitative evaluation of a community-based, outreach worker delivered, intervention that aimed to increase uptake of NHS smoking cessation services and tailor services to meet the needs of Bangladeshi and Pakistani men. \r\n\r\nMethods\r\nThis was a longitudinal, qualitative study, nested within a phase II cluster randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention. We explored the perspectives and experiences of five outreach workers, two stop smoking service managers and a specialist stop smoking advisor. Data were collected through focus group discussions, weekly diaries, observations of management meetings, shadowing of outreach workers, and one-to-one interviews with outreach workers and their managers. Analysis was undertaken using a modified Framework approach. \r\n\r\nResults\r\nOutreach workers promoted cessation services by word of mouth on the streets, in health service premises, in local businesses and at a wide range of community events. They emphasised the reasons for cessation, especially health effects, financial implications, and the impact of smoking on the family. Many smokers agreed to be referred to cessation services, but few attended, this in part being explained by concerns about the relative inflexibility of existing service provision. Although outreach workers successfully expanded service reach, they faced the challenges of perceived lack of awareness of the health risks associated with smoking in older smokers and apathy in younger smokers. These were compounded by perceptions of \"lip service\" being given to their role by community organisations and tensions both amongst the outreach workers and with the wider management team. \r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nOutreach workers expanded reach of the service through taking it to diverse locations of relevance to Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities. The optimum method of outreach to retain and treat Bangladeshi and Pakistani smokers effectively in cessation programmes needs further development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Begh, Rachna A","Aveyard, Paul","Upton, Penney","Bhopal, Raj S","White, Martin","Amos, Amanda","Prescott, Robin J","Bedi, Raman","Barton, Pelham M","Fletcher, Monica","Gill, Paramjit","Zaidi, Qaim","Sheikh, Aziz"],"dc:date":"2011-06-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":341217,"sim:weight":0.413067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.368603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.301293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.301293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It highlighted women\u0027s anxiety and lack of information, resulting in recommendations for improvements. Since then the colposcopy service has changed substantially. It is therefore time to re-visit women\u0027s experience of this service and reflect upon the success of service changes in improving experience and reducing anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate women\u0027s experience of being referred for, and attending, colposcopy appointments, and identify potential service improvements. \r\n\r\nMethods\r\nQualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 18 women newly referred for colposcopy in the West Midlands, UK. The interviews were designed to elicit the experience of colposcopy from the patients\u0027 perspective. \r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe eight emerging themes were catogised as three overarching concepts, which were: feelings of emotional reaction, choices being accommodated and time delays. Women felt very apprehensive before their appointment, but when attending, appreciated being consulted about their preferences. Delays in referral and feeling \u0027rushed\u0027 by staff impacted negatively on women\u0027s experience. \r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nService changes in information provision and increased respect for dignity seem to have improved the experience that women have of colposcopy, however, this does not appear to have translated into decreased anxiety.

The aim of this study was to test whether proprioceptive signals can spatially cue a visual target to improve its detection. Participants were instructed to use a planar manipulandum in a forward reaching action and determine during this movement whether a near-threshold visual target appeared at either of two lateral positions. The target presentation was followed by a masking stimulus, which made its possible location unambiguous, but not its presence. Proprioceptive cues were given by applying a brief lateral force to the participant’s arm, either in the same direction (validly cued) or in the opposite direction (invalidly cued) to the on-screen location of the mask. The d′ detection rate of the target increased when the direction of proprioceptive stimulus was compatible with the location of the visual target compared to when it was incompatible.

Within skeletal muscle, 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) converts cortisone (11-dehydrocorticosterone in rodents) to active cortisol (corticosterone in rodents). We aimed to determine the mechanisms underpinning glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and indentify how 11beta-HSD1 inhibitors improve insulin sensitivity. \r\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Rodent and human cell cultures, whole-tissue explants, and animal models were used to determine the impact of glucocorticoids and selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibition upon insulin signaling and action. \r\nRESULTS: Dexamethasone decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, decreased IRS1 mRNA and protein expression, and increased inactivating pSer\\(^{307}\\) insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1. 11beta-HSD1 activity and expression were observed in human and rodent myotubes and muscle explants. Activity was predominantly oxo-reductase, generating active glucocorticoid. A1 (selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibitor) abolished enzyme activity and blocked the increase in pSer\\(^{307}\\) IRS1 and reduction in total IRS1 protein after treatment with 11DHC but not corticosterone. In C57Bl6/J mice, the selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibitor, A2, decreased fasting blood glucose levels and improved insulin sensitivity. In KK mice treated with A2, skeletal muscle pSer\\(^{307}\\) IRS1 decreased and pThr\\(^{308}\\) Akt/PKB increased. In addition, A2 decreased both lipogenic and lipolytic gene expression.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Prereceptor facilitation of glucocorticoid action via 11beta-HSD1 increases pSer\\(^{307}\\) IRS1 and may be crucial in mediating insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibition decreases pSer\\(^{307}\\) IRS1, increases pThr\\(^{308}\\) Akt/PKB, and decreases lipogenic and lipolytic gene expression that may represent an important mechanism underpinning their insulin-sensitizing action.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morgan, S.

One approach is to examine evidence from neuropsychiatric disorders of cerebellar involvement. In this review, we narrow this search to test whether there is evidence of motor dysfunction associated with neuropsychiatric disorders consistent with disruption of cerebellar motor function. While we do find such evidence, especially in autism, schizophrenia and dyslexia, we caution that the restricted set of motor symptoms does not suggest global cerebellar dysfunction.

As a result, state building has largely been carried out as a ‘technical-administrative’ exercise focusing on the technicalities of constructing and running organisations rather than on the politics of creating states, leading to a lack of overall political coherence in\r\nterms of where SSR is, or should be, going and of what kinds of state are being constructed. Politics is frequently cited by practitioners as representing a set of obstacles to be overcome to achieve SSR rather than a set of assumptions about actually doing it.

It raises questions about the underlying political assumptions of the SSR process and contemporary SSR material, much of which lacks analysis of underlying theories of SSR relating to broader state-building and construction of a liberal peace. \r\n\r\nUsing a case taken from the reconstruction of Sierra Leone, this paper outlines some of the key issues emerging after ten years of reconstruction efforts. Sierra Leone is usually over-cited, but given its importance to any orthodoxy that may be said to exist, it is relevant here. Fundamentally, Sierra Leone remains a relatively small state in West Africa and the fact a viable state remains elusive, challenges assumptions about time taken in reconstructing socio-political norms and structures, and also questions state-building as a post-conflict approach. \r\n\r\nThis paper will argue that SSR in Sierra Leone was never a developed strategy but came to represent a series of policies that evolved on the ground largely as the result of the interaction of individuals and groups engaged in those early decisions, sometimes against the wishes of Whitehall, but always sharing a “direction of travel.” This is an important point in terms of how SSR policy was actually developed and also how approaches come to be seen as being far smoother and well planned with hindsight, but also in terms of how policy-makers and academics can learn about social, governance and security processes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jackson, Paul B","Sedra, Mark"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A parallel study incorporated this fermentation system into an integrated biohydrogen refinery (IBR) for the conversion of organic waste to hydrogen and energy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Redwood, MD","Orozco, RL","Majewski, AJ","Macaskie, LE"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1633074,"sim:weight":0.723098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631958,"sim:weight":0.649501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632032,"sim:weight":0.620682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631315,"sim:weight":0.56389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631318,"sim:weight":0.519733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631314,"sim:weight":0.514686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631308,"sim:weight":0.480673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051899,"sim:weight":0.446592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631313,"sim:weight":0.369067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101630,"sim:weight":0.295261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631640,"sim:weight":0.280073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25847,"sim:weight":0.274964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145640,"sim:weight":0.256514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62082,"sim:weight":0.253753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102601,"sim:weight":0.252791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381911,"sim:weight":0.251497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76435,"sim:weight":0.24739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101280,"sim:weight":0.243423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26680,"sim:weight":0.240556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25778,"sim:weight":0.240163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is a feasibility trial for the investigation of a very low calorie diet (VLCD), individual modest energy restriction, and usual advice on hunger, ketosis, urges to smoke, abstinence and weight gain in overweight smokers trying to quit. \r\n\r\nMethods\r\nThis is a 3 armed, unblinded, randomized controlled trial in overweight (BMI \u003e 25 kg/\\(m^2\\)), daily smokers (CO \u003e 10 ppm); with at least 30 participants in each group. Each group receives identical behavioural support and NRT patches (25 mg(8 weeks),15 mg(2 weeks),10 mg(2 weeks)). The VLCD group receive a 429-559 kcal/day liquid formula beginning 1 week before quitting and continuing for 4 weeks afterwards. The modest energy restricted group (termed individual dietary and activity planning(IDAP)) engage in goal-setting and receive an energy prescription based on individual basal metabolic rate(BMR) aiming for daily reduction of 600 kcal. The control group receive usual dietary advice that accompanies smoking cessation i.e. avoiding feeling hungry but eating healthy snacks. After this, the VLCD participants receive IDAP to provide support for changing eating habits in the longer term; the IDAP group continues receiving this support. The control group receive IDAP 8 weeks after quitting. This allows us to compare IDAP following a successful quit attempt with dieting concurrently during quitting. It also aims to prevent attrition in the unblinded, control group by meeting their need for weight management. Follow-up occurs at 6 and 12 months. \r\n\r\nOutcome measures include participant acceptability, measured qualitatively by semi-structured interviewing and quantitatively by recruitment and attrition rates. Feasibility of running the trial within primary care is measured by interview and questionnaire of the treatment providers.

There are different designs of prosthetic discs, but one of the most common is a ball-and-socket combination. Contact between the bearing surfaces can result in high frictional torque, which can then result in wear and implant loosening. This study was designed to determine the effects of ball radius on friction. Generic models of metal-on-metal TDA were manufactured with ball radii of 10, 12, 14 and 16 mm, with a radial clearance of 0.015 mm. A simulator was used to test each sample in flexion-extension, lateral bending and axial rotation at frequencies of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75 and 2 Hz under loads of 50, 600, 1200 and 2000 N, in new born calf serum. Frictional torque was measured and Stribeck curves were plotted to illustrate the lubrication regime in each case. It was observed that implants with a smaller ball radius showed lower friction and showed boundary and mixed lubrication regimes, whereas implants with larger ball radius showed boundary lubrication only. This study suggests designing metal-on-metal TDAs with ball radius of 10 or 12 mm, in order to reduce wear and implant loosening.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moghadas, PM","Mahomed, A","Hukins, DWL","Shepherd, DET"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108653,"sim:weight":0.587564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109115,"sim:weight":0.50746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75671,"sim:weight":0.409218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26522,"sim:weight":0.395792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76176,"sim:weight":0.382252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108322,"sim:weight":0.368978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27099,"sim:weight":0.347307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26442,"sim:weight":0.325244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26443,"sim:weight":0.290836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77335,"sim:weight":0.248268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.247326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108680,"sim:weight":0.23964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22872,"sim:weight":0.210948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77317,"sim:weight":0.197267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27089,"sim:weight":0.19564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631076,"sim:weight":0.186937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268167,"sim:weight":0.183982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76480,"sim:weight":0.152031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It also highlights the wider evolution of surgery from traditional open operative techniques to the modern minimally invasive procedures. The following chapter discusses the surgical innovators and the techniques they have described that have enabled the repair of both thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\r\nAortic aneurysms represent a significant health risk particularly for the elderly population. AAA is the 14th-leading cause of death for the 60- to 85-year–old age group in the United States (10.8 deaths per 100,000 population). TAA by contrast is less frequent with an incidence of 10.4 per 100,000. Both AAA and TAA are known to increase in prevalence with advancing age and have an increased prevalence in males. The risk of aneurysm rupture increases with increasing aneurysm diameter over 5.5-6.0 cm and is the primary indication for the repair of both TAA and AAA.Therefore surgery to repair both AAA and TAA is either pre-emptive to prevent rupture or emergent to repair a rupture. Repair of TAA and AAA by either open or minimally invasive techniques significantly reduces the risk of rupture and improves patient mortality. The establishment of these techniques has required the development of procedures from embryonic thoughts in the minds of the surgeons of antiquity through to the utilisation of ever increasing modern technologies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bhogal, Ricky Harminder","Downing, Richard"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43015,"sim:weight":0.702534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5729117,"sim:weight":0.562524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":939275,"sim:weight":0.548244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":868199,"sim:weight":0.414807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":983038,"sim:weight":0.374183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":732079,"sim:weight":0.369934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":520839,"sim:weight":0.359366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":913328,"sim:weight":0.359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4193227,"sim:weight":0.339907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":897642,"sim:weight":0.332921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1098610,"sim:weight":0.275893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5729150,"sim:weight":0.259568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":794363,"sim:weight":0.251701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":663457,"sim:weight":0.247855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":950777,"sim:weight":0.235089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":954042,"sim:weight":0.233266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5729547,"sim:weight":0.229128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":871291,"sim:weight":0.22775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":517150,"sim:weight":0.220379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":598994,"sim:weight":0.214594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Fast ripples are highly specific for the seizure initiation zone. However, evidence for the association of fast ripples with epileptic foci depends on animal models and human cases with substantial lesions in the form of hippocampal sclerosis, which suggests that neuronal loss may be required for fast ripples. In the present work, we tested whether cell loss is a necessary prerequisite for the generation of fast ripples, using a non-lesional model of temporal lobe epilepsy that lacks hippocampal sclerosis. The model is induced by unilateral intrahippocampal injection of tetanus toxin.Recordings from the hippocampi of freely-moving epileptic rats revealed high-frequency activity (4100 Hz), including fast ripples. High-frequency activity was present both during interictal discharges and seizure onset. Interictal fast ripples proved a significantly more reliable marker of the primary epileptogenic zone than the presence of either interictal discharges or ripples (100–250 Hz).

Eighteen semi-structured, repeat interviews were carried out to develop a capability-based descriptive system for the measure. Informants were purposively selected to ensure variation in socio-economic status, age, sex, ethnicity and health. Data analysis was carried out inductively and iteratively alongside interviews, and findings were used to shape the questions in later interviews.\r\nResults Five over-arching attributes of capability wellbeing were identified for the measure: ‘‘stability’’,‘‘attachment’’, ‘‘achievement’’, ‘‘autonomy’’ and ‘‘enjoyment’’. One item, with four response categories, was developed for each attribute for the ICECAP-A descriptive system.\r\nConclusions The ICECAP-A capability measure represents a departure from traditional health economics outcome measures, by treating health status as an influence over broader attributes of capability wellbeing. Further work is required to value and validate the attributes and test the sensitivity of the ICECAP-A to healthcare interventions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Janabi, Hareth","Flynn, Terry","Coast, Joanna"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These leukocytes have been implicated in age-related inflammatory diseases such as dry-eye, but their phenotypic characteristics remain largely undetermined. Existing literature provides rudimentary data from predominantly immunohistochemical analyses of tissue sections, prohibiting detailed and longitudinal examination of these cells in health and disease. Using recovered cells from ocular surface impression cytology and flow cytometry, we examined the frequency of leukocyte subsets in human conjunctival epithelium and how this alters with age. Of the total CD45+ leukocyte population within the conjunctival epithelium, 87% [32–99] (median) [range] \r\ncomprised lymphocytes, with 69%[47–90] identified as CD3+CD56- Tcells.

A number of smokers have tried unsuccessfully to quit this way. Reducing smoking before quitting could be an alternative approach to cessation. Before this method is adopted it is important to determine whether it is at least as successful as abrupt quitting.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n1. To compare the success of reducing smoking to quit and abrupt quitting interventions. 2. To compare adverse events between arms in studies that used pharmacotherapy to aid reduction.\r\n\r\nSearch methods\r\nWe searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group specialised register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycInfo for topic specific terms combined with terms used to identify trials of tobacco addiction interventions. We also searched reference lists of relevant papers and contacted authors of ongoing trials. Date of most recent search: November 2009.\r\n\r\nSelection criteria\r\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited adults who wanted to quit smoking. Studies included at least one condition which instructed participants to reduce their smoking and then quit and one condition which instructed participants to quit abruptly.\r\n\r\nData collection and analysis\r\nThe outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up. We pooled the included trials using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model. Trials were split for two sub-group analyses: pharmacotherapy vs no pharmacotherapy, self help therapy vs behavioural support. Adverse events were summarised as a narrative. It was not possible to compare them quantitatively as there was variation in the nature and depth of reporting across studies.\r\n\r\nMain results\r\nTen studies were relevant for inclusion, with a total of 3760 participants included in the meta-analysis. Three of these studies used pharmacotherapy as part of the interventions. Five studies included behavioural support in the intervention, four included self-help therapy, and the remaining study had arms which included behavioural support and arms which included self-help therapy. Neither reduction or abrupt quitting had superior abstinence rates when all the studies were combined in the main analysis (RR\u003d 0.94, 95% CI\u003d 0.79 to 1.13), whether pharmacotherapy was used (RR\u003d 0.87, 95% CI\u003d 0.65 to 1.22), or not (RR\u003d 0.97, 95% CI\u003d 0.78 to 1.21), whether studies included behavioural support (RR\u003d 0.87, 95% CI\u003d 0.64 to 1.17) or self-help therapy (RR\u003d 0.98, 95% CI\u003d 0.78 to1.23). We were unable to draw conclusions about the difference in adverse events between interventions, however recent studies suggest that pre-quit NRT does not increase adverse events.\r\n\r\nAuthors\u0027 conclusions\r\nReducing cigarettes smoked before quit day and quitting abruptly, with no prior reduction, produced comparable quit rates, therefore patients can be given the choice to quit in either of these ways. Reduction interventions can be carried out using self-help materials or aided by behavioural support, and can be carried out with the aid of pre-quit NRT. Further research needs to investigate which method of reduction before quitting is the most effective, and which categories of smokers benefit the most from each method, to inform future policy and intervention development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lindson, Nicola","Aveyard, Paul","Hughes, John R"],"dc:date":"2010-03-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1632064,"sim:weight":0.798243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632065,"sim:weight":0.795781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631336,"sim:weight":0.692139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1007799,"sim:weight":0.397984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Many smokers feel that reduction is natural and if reduction programmes were offered, many more might take up treatment. Few trials of reduction versus abrupt cessation have been completed.

In the reduction arm,participants will be advised to reduce smoking consumption by half in the first week and to 25% of baseline in the second, leading up to a quit day at which participants will stop smoking completely.This will be assisted by nicotine patches and an acute form of nicotine replacement therapy. In the abrupt arm participants will use nicotine patches only, whilst smoking as normal, for two weeks prior to a quit day, at which they will also stop smoking completely. Smokers in either arm will have standard withdrawal orientated behavioural support programme with a combination of nicotine patches and acute nicotine replacement therapy post-cessation.\r\nOutcomes/Follow-up: The primary outcome of interest will be prolonged abstinence from smoking, with secondary trial outcomes of point prevalence, urges to smoke and withdrawal\r\nsymptoms.

This study aims to describe referral patterns, disease phenotype and management strategies in patients who present with either early or established disease to two large tertiary care hospitals in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 54 consecutive patients with a documented history of OcMMP were followed for 24 months. Two groups were defined: (i) early-onset disease (EOD:\u003c3 years, n\u003d26, 51 eyes) and (ii) established disease (EstD:\u003e5 years, n\u003d24, 48 eyes). Data were captured at first clinic visit, and at 12 and 24 months follow-up. Information regarding duration, activity and stage of disease, visual acuity (VA), therapeutic strategies and clinical outcome were analysed.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Patients with EOD were younger and had more severe conjunctival inflammation (76% of inflamed eyes) than the EstD group, who had poorer VA (26.7%\u003dVA\u003c3/60, P\u003c0.01) and more advanced disease. Although 40% of patients were on existing immunosuppression, 48% required initiation or switch to more potent immunotherapy. In all, 28% (14) were referred back to the originating hospitals for continued care. Although inflammation had resolved in 78% (60/77) at 12 months, persistence of inflammation and progression did not differ between the two phenotypes. Importantly, 42% demonstrated disease progression in the absence of clinically detectable inflammation.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: These data highlight that irrespective of OcMMP phenotype, initiation or escalation of potent immunosuppression is required at tertiary hospitals. Moreover, the conjunctival scarring progresses even when the eye remains clinically quiescent. Early referral to tertiary centres is recommended to optimise immunosuppression and limit long-term ocular damage.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Geraint P.","Radford, C","Nightingale, Peter","Dart, J K G","Rauz, Saaeha"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.357099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25893,"sim:weight":0.280388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76620,"sim:weight":0.273481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76079,"sim:weight":0.265225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25869,"sim:weight":0.252561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23145,"sim:weight":0.24455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23114,"sim:weight":0.233198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25871,"sim:weight":0.194752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11157,"sim:weight":0.168787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

My response is aimed at defending a modest doxastic account of clinical delusions, and is articulated in three sections. First, I consider the view that delusions are in-between perceptual and doxastic states, defended by Jacob Hohwy and Vivek Rajan, and the view that delusions are failed attempts at believing or not-quite-beliefs, proposed by Eric Schwitzgebel and Maura Tumulty. Then, I address the relationship between the doxastic account of delusions and the role, nature, and prospects of folk psychology, which is discussed by Dominic Murphy, Keith Frankish, and Maura Tumulty in their contributions. In the final remarks, I turn to the continuity thesis and suggest that, although there are important differences between clinical delusions and non-pathological beliefs, these differences cannot be characterised satisfactorily in epistemic terms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bortolotti, Lisa"],"dc:date":"2011-06-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2734385,"sim:weight":0.400987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85872,"sim:weight":0.366487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73150,"sim:weight":0.343395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85453,"sim:weight":0.338423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176874,"sim:weight":0.331919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":72959,"sim:weight":0.327966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43930,"sim:weight":0.327496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764201,"sim:weight":0.324727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9537944,"sim:weight":0.324647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.312191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43493,"sim:weight":0.310091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3660,"sim:weight":0.309018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43701,"sim:weight":0.304988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383934,"sim:weight":0.303604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176841,"sim:weight":0.299483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.295975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386251,"sim:weight":0.29356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.287451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108330,"sim:weight":0.286017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43177,"sim:weight":0.285095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

SI in Papaver rhoeas triggers a Ca2+-dependent signaling network to trigger programmed cell death (PCD), providing a neat way to inhibit and destroy incompatible pollen. We previously established that SI stimulates F-actin depolymerization and that altering actin dynamics can push pollen tubes into PCD. Very little is known about the role of microtubules in pollen tubes. Here, we investigated whether the pollen tube microtubule cytoskeleton is a target for the SI signals. We show that SI triggers very rapid apparent depolymerization of cortical microtubules, which, unlike actin, does not reorganize later. Actin depolymerization can trigger microtubule depolymerization but not vice versa. Moreover, although disruption of microtubule dynamics alone does not trigger PCD, alleviation of SI-induced PCD by taxol implicates a role for microtubule depolymerization in mediating PCD. Together, our data provide good evidence that SI signals target the microtubule cytoskeleton and suggest that signal integration between microfilaments and microtubules is required for triggering of PCD.","bibo:AuthorList":["Poulter, N.

In this paper, I aim to respond to McKitrick’s arguments and to defend the metaphysical and epistemological propriety of component vectors. My strategy appeals to varying kinematic frames of reference. By transforming to the appropriate non‐inertial frame, component acceleration vectors can be transformed into resultant acceleration vectors, and in such frames they become directly observable. Being a component acceleration vector and being a resultant acceleration vector are both frame‐dependent properties of properties; they are not to be thought of as intrinsic or fundamental properties of an acceleration vector, but as artefacts of our framedependent notation for representing vector quantities. To conclude the paper, I defend the view proposed against two styles of objection. The first objection resurrects scepticism about component vectors as scepticism about fundamental component vectors.

I begin by outlining the salient features of  ‘decoherence-based’ EQM, and of the ’consistent histories’ formalism that  is particularly apt for conceptual discussions in EQM. This formalism permits of both ‘branching worlds’and ‘parallel worlds’ interpretations; the metaphysics of EQM is in this sense underdetermined by the physics. A prominent argument due to David Lewis [1986] supports the non-branching interpretation. Belnap et al. [2001] refer to Lewis’ argument as the ’Assertion problem’, and propose a pragmatic response to it. I argue that their response is unattractively ad hoc and complex, and that it prevents an Everettian who adopts branching-time semantics from making clear sense of objective probability. The upshot is that Everettians are better off without branching-time semantics. I conclude by discussing and rejecting an alternative possible motivation for branching time.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilson, Alastair"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108466,"sim:weight":0.544459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108071,"sim:weight":0.536592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734385,"sim:weight":0.508853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108992,"sim:weight":0.468462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.447053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176841,"sim:weight":0.4427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85872,"sim:weight":0.429798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108414,"sim:weight":0.415786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.358412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.358412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77162,"sim:weight":0.344612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108461,"sim:weight":0.339724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The information behaviour of the participants was investigated.

This study investigated the short-term effects of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) on calvarial-derived MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. MC3T3-E1 expressed GDNF as well as its canonical receptors, GFRα1 and RET. Addition of recombinant GDNF to cultures in serum-containing medium modestly inhibited cell growth at high concentrations; however, under serum-free culture conditions GDNF dose-dependently increased cell proliferation. GDNF effects on cell growth were inversely correlated with its effect on alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity showing a significant dose-dependent inhibition of relative ALP activity with increasing concentrations of GDNF in serum-free culture medium. Live/dead and lactate dehydrogenase assays demonstrated GDNF did not significantly affect cell death or survival under serum-containing and serum-free conditions. The effect of GDNF on cell growth was abolished in the presence of inhibitors to GFR α 1 and RET indicating that GDNF stimulated calvarial osteoblasts via its canonical receptors. Finally, this study found that GDNF synergistically increased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-stimulated MC3T3-E1 cell growth suggesting that GDNF interacted with TNF-α-induced signaling in osteoblastic cells. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for a direct, receptor-mediated effect of GDNF on osteoblasts highlighting a novel role for GDNF in bone physiology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gale, Z.","Cooper, P.

Cultures of DPCs expressed GDNF as well as its receptors, GFRα1 and RET. Addition of recombinant GDNF to cultures in serum-containing medium did not significantly affect DPC growth; however, GNDF dose-dependently increased viable cell number under serum-free culture conditions. Live/dead, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and caspase -3,-7 assays demonstrated that cell death occurred under serum-free conditions, and that GDNF significantly reduced the number of dead cells by inhibiting apoptotic cell death. GDNF also stimulated cell proliferation in serum-free conditions, as assessed by the BrdU incorporation assay. The effect of GDNF was abolished in the presence of specific inhibitors to GFRα1 and RET suggesting receptor-mediated events. This study also demonstrated that GDNF counteracted TNFα-induced DPC cytotoxicity, suggesting that GDNF may be cytoptotective under disease conditions. In conclusion, our findings indicate that GDNF promotes cell survival and proliferation of DPC and suggest that GDNF may play a multi-functional role in the regulation of dental pulp homeostasis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gale, Z.","Cooper, P.

They are structurally sufficient, energy efficient, easy to use in construction and more sustainable. SIPs are a composite sandwich panel system, typically made of two oriented strand board (OSB) panels and one insulation core material such as expanded polystyrene (EPS) or polyurethane (PUR). They have high strength-to-weight ratio and can resist axial, transverse and racking loads. Therefore, they can be used as structural materials for roof, wall and floor panels. An entire building structure can be made of SIPs without including many conventional construction materials such as steel or masonry. Due to the limited application and research on SIPs, the knowledge of this material is still lacking. This is exacerbated by the fact that the structural performance of SIPs has been reported varies from manufacturer to manufacturer as they use different SIP construction and connection details. In applying SIPs as structural materials, apart from addressing conventional structural issues, there is another major concern related to their long-term performance, mainly caused by creep. Both facial and core materials experience high creep behaviour, and it has been found that the creep of SIPs is predominantly caused by the core material. This paper will report studies conducted at University of Birmingham on structural behaviours of SIPs under both short-term and long-term loadings.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rungthonkit, Prathan","Yang, Jian"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.329205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25819,"sim:weight":0.252171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.221948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387311,"sim:weight":0.205397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17994,"sim:weight":0.194176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.186616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.184683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Generally dubbed “frozen conflicts”, the separatist conflicts in the Caucasus have been considered by many authors as political and military stalemates. This approach, however, tended to brush aside sociological dynamics at work inside what could have been more accurately described as “zones of conflict”. The main argument is to demonstrate how the oppositional logic of the autocratic de facto government in power and outside interference in the region, from Russia and Georgia mainly, are affecting the state building process of South Ossetia by marginalizing the local population and its needs. In fact, no real state building will take place in South Ossetia, either as a component of a Georgian Federation or as an entity in the Russian Federation, without addressing more carefully the needs of the local population.

For CaMnO3, an increase in the electronic conductivity was observed, which can be correlated with electron doping due to the oxyanion doping favoring the introduction of oxide ion vacancies (as well as the higher valence of P5+ compared to Mn4+ in the case of phosphate doping). The highest conductivity at 800ºC was observed for CaMn0.95P0.05O3-δ, 43.0 S·cm-1, in comparison with 7.6 S·cm-1 for undoped CaMnO3 at the same temperature. For La1-ySryMnO3−δ the conductivity suffers a decrease for all compositions on borate doping, attributed to a reduction in the hole (Mn4+) concentration. In order to investigate the potential of these materials as SOFC cathodes, the chemical compatibility with Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (CGO10) has also been investigated. For the calcium manganites, the lowest temperature examined without reaction was 900 ºC, with minor amounts of Ca4Mn3O10 observed at 1000ºC. Composites of these cathode materials with 50% CGO10 were examined on dense CGO10 pellets and the area specific resistances (ASR) in symmetrical cells were determined. The ASR values, at 800ºC, were 1.50, 0.37 and 0.30 Ω·cm2 for CaMnO3, CaMn0.95B0.05O3-δ and CaMn0.95P0.05O3-δ, respectively. For the lanthanum strontium manganites, the B-doped compositions showed an improvement in the ASR values with respect to the parent compounds, despite the lower electronic conductivity. This may be due to an increase in ionic conductivity due to borate incorporation leading to the formation of oxide ion vacancies. Thus these preliminary results show that oxyanion doping has a beneficial effect on the performance of perovskite manganite cathode materials, and suggests that this doping strategy warrants further investigation in other perovskite cathode systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["Porras-Vasquez, Jose","Kemp, T","Hanna, J","Slater, Peter.R."],"dc:date":"2012-03-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631245,"sim:weight":0.439275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631240,"sim:weight":0.344124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76903,"sim:weight":0.203702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76901,"sim:weight":0.203542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77313,"sim:weight":0.189826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108606,"sim:weight":0.188795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76843,"sim:weight":0.185234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76800,"sim:weight":0.179055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23279,"sim:weight":0.173044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77211,"sim:weight":0.157318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631076,"sim:weight":0.139011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108676,"sim:weight":0.132902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108734,"sim:weight":0.125413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108874,"sim:weight":0.124455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The work shows the potential of oxyanion doping strategies to modify the performance of SOFC cathode materials.","bibo:AuthorList":["Porras-Vazquez, J","Slater, Peter.R."],"dc:date":"2012-07-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

After trying to prioritize institution-building while paying lip service to empowerment imperatives, international officials had to readjust their strategy following contestation and resistance from local partners.

To address this, we report here an approach that enhances long-term stability to \u003e1 year of biologically relevant amorphous metal phosphates, in the absence of any complex stabilisers, by utilising pyrophosphates (P2O7 4-); species themselves ubiquitous in vivo. Ambient temperature precipitation reactions were employed to synthesise amorphous Ca2P2O7.nH2O and Sr2P2O7.nH2O (3.8 \u003c n \u003c 4.2) and their stability and structure were investigated. Pair distribution functions (PDF) derived from synchrotron X-ray data indicated a lack of structural order beyond ~8 A° in both phases, with this local order found to resemble crystalline analogues. Further studies, including 1H and 31P solid state NMR, suggest the unusually high stability of these purely inorganic amorphous phases is partly due to disorder in the P–O–P bond angles within the P2O7 units, which impede crystallization, and to water molecules, which are involved in H-bonds of various strengths within the structures and hamper the formation of an ordered network. In situ high temperature powder X-ray diffraction data indicated that the amorphous nature of both phases surprisingly persisted to ~450° C. Further NMR and TGA studies found that above ambient temperature some water molecules reacted with P2O7 anions, leading to the hydrolysis of some P–O–P linkages and the formation of HPO4 2- anions within the amorphous matrix. The latter anions then recombined into P2O7 ions at higher temperatures prior to crystallization. Together, these findings provide important new materials with unexplored potential for enzyme-assisted resorption and establish factors crucial to isolate further stable amorphous inorganic materials.","bibo:AuthorList":["Slater, Colin","Laurencin, Danielle","Burnell, Victoria","Smith, Mark E.","Grover, Liam M.","Hriljac, Joseph A.","Wright, Adrian J."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84771,"sim:weight":0.250991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23279,"sim:weight":0.233313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23286,"sim:weight":0.21987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25015,"sim:weight":0.206053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631534,"sim:weight":0.205787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75325,"sim:weight":0.194123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.185532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113592,"sim:weight":0.176903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75935,"sim:weight":0.163505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26613,"sim:weight":0.161141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77034,"sim:weight":0.159348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85352,"sim:weight":0.157617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76604,"sim:weight":0.154078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108105,"sim:weight":0.153498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76038,"sim:weight":0.153208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631076,"sim:weight":0.146986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108515,"sim:weight":0.144797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108734,"sim:weight":0.11865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The first, AB210, was recovered before tigecycline therapy and was susceptible to this agent; the second, AB211, was recovered after therapy and was resistant. \r\nMethods: DNA from AB210 was sequenced by 454 GS FLX pyrosequencing according to the standard protocol for whole-genome shotgun sequencing, producing ~250 bp fragment reads. AB211 was shotgun sequenced using the Illumina Genetic Analyzer to produce fragment reads of exactly 36 bp. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and large deletions detected in AB211 in relation to AB210 were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. \r\nResults: Automated gene prediction detected 3850 putative coding sequences (CDSs). Sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of plasmids pAB0057 and pACICU2 in both isolates. Eighteen putative SNPs were detected between the pre- and post-therapy isolates, AB210 and AB211. Three contigs in AB210 were not covered by reads in AB211, representing three deletions of ~15, 44 and 17 kb. \r\nConclusions: This study demonstrates that significant differences were detectable between two bacterial isolates recovered 1 week apart from the same patient, and reveals the potential of whole-genome sequencing as a tool for elucidating the processes responsible for changes in antibiotic susceptibility profiles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hornsey, M.","Loman, N.

This article addresses this question by examining how the International Monetary Fund (IMF) responded to the challenges presented by Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) between the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the launch of the euro in 1999. Based on primary research from the IMF Archives, the article illustrates how the IMF’s efforts to reconfigure its relationship with European institutions evolved gradually through a logic of incremental change, despite initial opposition from member states. The article concludes that bureaucratic actors within international organizations will take advantage of informal avenues for promoting a new agenda when this fits with shared conceptions of an organization’s mandate. The exercise of informal influence by advocates for change within an international organization can limit the options available to states in formal decisionmaking processes, even when these options cut across state preferences.","bibo:AuthorList":["Broome, André"],"dc:date":"2013","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77832,"sim:weight":0.242186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77323,"sim:weight":0.219627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76631,"sim:weight":0.209908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Antibody response was assessed at baseline, and at one and 12 months following vaccination.  Taking into account baseline antibody titer, overall life events exposure and social support were not associated with response to any of the influenza strains.  However, bereavement in the year prior to vaccination was negatively associated with the one-month response to the A/Panama and B/Shangdong strains.  Being married and having higher marital satisfaction was also associated with higher peak responses to the A/Panama influenza strain at one month.  The positive association between marital satisfaction and A/Panama response was particularly evident in the younger half of the married sample.  These associations largely withstood adjustment for potential confounders.  Thus, in the elderly, peak antibody response was associated with bereavement and marriage, and not the more general factors, life events and social support, related to antibody response in student samples.  This suggests the importance of taking a life course approach to examining relationships between psychosocial factors and immunity, and that interventions to modify the impact of these factors should address those most salient for each age group.","bibo:AuthorList":["Phillips, Anna C.","Carroll, Douglas","Burns, Victoria E.","Ring, Christopher","Macleod, John","Drayson, Mark"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8769375,"sim:weight":0.540748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769378,"sim:weight":0.51583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769367,"sim:weight":0.435822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222855,"sim:weight":0.229041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Exploring the analytic institutions created by international organisations provides insights into how they make their member states ‘legible’, and how greater legibility enables them to construct cognitive authority in specific policy areas which in turn enhances their capacity to influence changes in national frameworks for economic and social governance. By ‘seeing like an international organisation’ we can increase our understanding of the cognitive and organisational environment that guides an IO’s actions and informs its policy advice to states, which enables a more comprehensive picture of how the everyday business of global governance works in practice. Instead of ‘black boxing’ international organisations, the contributors to this special issue demonstrate how studying IOs from the inside-out expands both our understanding of the policy dialogue between IOs and their member states, as well as how IOs and states learn from each other over time.","bibo:AuthorList":["Broome, André","Seabrooke, Leonard"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84852,"sim:weight":0.218978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.210745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.210745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76162,"sim:weight":0.197774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77218,"sim:weight":0.175476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Methods: In a substantial cohort of 585 healthy young adults, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate were recorded at rest and in response to a mental arithmetic stress task.  Participants indicated, from a list of 50 events, those they had experienced in the last year.  Results: There was an overall association between life events and blunted cardiovascular reactivity that was driven by variations in the frequency of exposure to desirable events.  The total number of events and the number of personal events were negatively associated with systolic blood pressure and pulse rate reactions to acute stress, whereas the number of work-related events was negatively associated with diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate reactivity.  The negative association between total events and systolic blood pressure reactivity was stronger for women than men, whereas men exposed to frequent undesirable events showed enhanced diastolic blood pressure reactivity.  The blunting of pulse rate reactivity associated with frequent personal life events was evident particularly for those who had a relatively large number of close friends.  Conclusions: The nature and extent of the association between life events exposure and stress reactivity in young adults depends on the valence of the events together with the sex of the individual and their social network size.","bibo:AuthorList":["Phillips, Anna C.","Carroll, Douglas","Ring, Christopher","Sweeting, Helen","West, Patrick"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8769370,"sim:weight":0.51407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8769383,"sim:weight":0.475644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.226472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85332,"sim:weight":0.219569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.213418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.213418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26077,"sim:weight":0.205764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108200,"sim:weight":0.171567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Life events in the previous year and customary social support were measured in 57 healthy students at baseline.  Antibody status was also assessed at baseline and at five weeks and five months following vaccination with the trivalent influenza vaccine and the meningococcal A+C polysaccharide vaccine.  Taking into account baseline antibody titre, high life events scores prior to vaccination were associated with lower responses to the B/Shangdong influenza strain at both five weeks and five months and meningococcal C at five weeks.  Life events scores were not associated with response to the other two influenza viral strains nor response to meningococcal A.  Those with high social support scores had stronger 5-week and 5-month antibody responses to the A/Panama influenza strain, but not to any of the other strains.  These associations could not be accounted for by demographic or health behaviour factors, and also emerged from analyses comparing those who exhibited a four-fold increase in antibody titre from baseline with those who did not.  Life events and social support were related to antibody status following influenza vaccination in distinctive ways that may be partly determined by vaccine novelty and prior naturalistic exposure.

Around 20 years ago, Appels [1] identified a prodromal constellation of symptoms, including physical exhaustion and feelings of hopelessness, that preceded major CHD events. It was hypothesized that this syndrome of “vital exhaustion” (VE) was a causal risk factor for CHD events, and several observational studies demonstrating prospective associations between VE and subsequent events have been adduced as supporting the hypothesis [2], [3], [4] and [5]. In a recent commentary, however, we discussed the difficulties inherent in drawing causal conclusions from observational evidence [6]. Applying general arguments that are by now very well rehearsed [7] and [8], we suggested that considerations such as confounding by common antecedents of both VE and CHD and reverse causation could not be readily dismissed and resolution was likely only following experimental studies. For example, an explanation of these prospective associations that regards CHD events as the result of inflammatory processes involved in the progress of atherosclerosis and VE as a consequence of such processes is just as parsimonious as one that regards VE as a causal risk.

Methods: Cardiovascular reactions to mental arithmetic stress were measured in 112 healthy young women tested in one of eight distinct independent conditions: active supportive male friend; active supportive female friend, passive male friend; passive female friend; active supportive male stranger; active supportive female stranger, passive male stranger; and passive female stranger.  Results: Support from a friend rather than a stranger was associated with attenuated blood pressure reactivity, but only when the supporter was a male friend.  Support from a male stranger or female friend was associated with augmented blood pressure reactivity.

Consequently, Steptoe’s edited book, Depression and Physical Illness, is timely and deals with what is a key public health issue.  With contributions from many of the key scholars in the field, this book provides an overview of the aetiology of depression, its relationship with major health conditions, and a critical discussion of the biological and behavioural mechanisms by which depression influences health.  \r\n\tPart one sets the scene by presenting critical discussions of the prevalence of major and minor depression in the medically ill, and the role of psychological and socio-demographic variables in the aetiology of depression.  The initial chapter introduces the notion that variations in the definition and measurement of depression affect its observed prevalence, 15-61%, in the medically ill.  Evidence that this is the most common psychopathology in the medically ill is presented with illustrations of the variation in incidence across different populations and settings, and the importance of diagnosis.  Chapter two presents evidence of a causal role for socio-demographic and psychological factors, e.g. economic position and life events stress, in the development of depression.  The complex and inter-related nature of the association between depression and such factors is highlighted.  \r\nPart two focuses on the relationship between depression and various health problems.  For example, chapters three and four discuss the links between depression and coronary heart disease.  First, the research evidence to date on prospective associations between depression and the aetiology of coronary heart disease is critically evaluated, and the likely bio-behavioural pathways are considered, although less attention is given to the possibility of reverse causation.  Second, evidence that depression contributes to poorer prognosis in cardiac patients is discussed.  At the end of chapter four, the limited success of treatments for depression in improving cardiac prognosis is highlighted, and an appeal is made for the identification of more effective therapies","bibo:AuthorList":["Phillips, Anna C."],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":115036,"sim:weight":0.280856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108868,"sim:weight":0.275707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.259118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.247239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448025,"sim:weight":0.245124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.211486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.211486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Service, sociodemographic, and health data were collected from service files, telephone interviews, and a medical examination. One-year prevalence of MDD and GAD was determined through a diagnostic interview schedule based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (version IV) criteria. Mortality over the subsequent 15 years was gathered from US army records. \r\n\r\nResults: MDD and GAD were positively and significantly associated with all-cause and CVD mortality. The relationships between MDD and GAD and CVD mortality were no longer significant after adjustment for sociodemograhics, health status at entry, health behaviors, and other risk markers.

The present case control study compared the antibody responses to vaccination of younger parental caregivers of children with developmental disabilities and parents of typically developing children.  Methods: At baseline assessment, 32 parents of children with developmental disabilities and 29 parents of typically developing children completed standard measures of perceived stress and child problem behaviours.  They also provided a blood sample and were then vaccinated with the thymus-dependent trivalent influenza vaccine.  Further blood samples were taken at 1- and 6-month follow-ups.  Results: Relative to parents of typically developing children (mean titre \u003d 458, SD \u003d 155.7 at 1-month and mean titre \u003d 265, SD \u003d 483.0 at 6-month follow-up) caregivers (mean titre \u003d 219, SD \u003d 528.4 at 1-month and 86, SD \u003d 55.0 at 6-month) mounted a poorer antibody response than controls to the B/Malaysia strain of the vaccine.  It was those caregivers reporting more child problem behaviours that tended to show the weakest antibody response.  Conclusion: The negative impact of caregiving on antibody response to vaccination would not appear to be restricted to older spousal caregivers, but is also evident in younger parents caring for children with developmental disabilities.  The behavioural characteristics of the care recipients may be a determinant of whether or not antibody response to vaccination is compromised.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gallagher, S.","Phillips, A.

However, there is recent evidence that low reactivity may predict elevated risk for a range of adverse health outcomes, such as depression, obesity, poor self-reported health, and compromised immunity.

Desulfovibrio spp. are anaerobic and produce H2S, a potent catalyst poison, whereas Escherichia coli can be pre-grown aerobically to high density, has well defined molecular tools, and also makes catalytically-active ‘Bio-Pd’. The first aim was to compare ‘Bio-Pd’ catalysts made by Desulfovibrio spp. and E. coli using suspended and immobilised catalysts. The second aim was to evaluate the potential for Bio-Pd-mediated dehalogenation of PCBs in used transformer oils, which preclude recovery and re-use.\r\nRESULTS \tCatalysis via Bio-PdD. desulfuricans and Bio-PdE. coli was compared at a mass loading of Pd:biomass of 1:3 via reduction of Cr(VI) in aqueous solution (immobilised catalyst) and hydrogenolytic  release of  Cl- from PCBs and used transformer oil  (catalyst suspensions). In both cases Bio-PdD. desulfuricans  outperformed  Bio-Pd E. coli  by ~3.5-fold,  attributable to a ~3.5-fold difference in their Pd-nanoparticle surface areas determined by magnetic measurements (Bio-PdD. desulfuricans) and by chemisorption analysis (Bio-PdE. coli).

Rate coefficients and product cations with their branching ratios were determined at 298 K.  Since the recombination energy of CF\\(_2^+\\) exceeds the ionisation energy of all four substituted ethenes, the reactions of this ion produce predominantly the products of non-dissociative charge transfer.  With their lower recombination energies, charge transfer in the reactions of CF\\(^+\\), CF\\(_3^+\\) and C\\(_2\\)F\\(_4^+\\) is always endothermic, so products can only be produced by reactions in which bonds form and break within a complex.  The trends observed in the results of the reactions of CF\\(^+\\) and CF\\(_3^+\\) may partially be explained by the changing value of the dipole moment of the three fluoroethenes, where the cation preferentially attacks the more nucleophilic part of the molecule.

This channel involves hydrogen atom loss for CH3F+, CH2F2+ and CH3Cl+, chlorine atom loss for CH2Cl2+, CHCl3+ and CHClF2+, and bromine atom loss for CBrClF2+. Accurate 0 K appearance energies, in conjunction with ab initio isodesmic and halogen exchange reaction energies, establish a thermochemical network, which is optimized to update and confirm the enthalpies of formation of the sample molecules and their dissociative photoionization products.

Breakdown curve analysis of such shallow well systems supplies a satisfactorily succinct route to the adiabatic ionization energy of the parent molecule, particularly if the threshold photoelectron spectrum is not resolved and a purely computational route is unfeasible. The ionization energies have been found to be 11.47 ± 0.01 eV, 12.30 ± 0.02 eV and 11.23 ± 0.03 eV for CHCl3, CHClF2 and CBrClF2, respectively.

MetS was ascertained from data on: body mass index; fasting blood glucose or a diabetes medication; blood pressure or a diagnosis of hypertension; HDL cholesterol; and triglyceride levels.  Contemporary morning fasted cortisol and DHEAS concentrations were determined.  The outcomes were MetS and its components. Analysis was by logistic regression, first adjusting for age and then additionally for an array of candidate confounders.  Results: Cortisol, although not in the fully adjusted analysis, and DHEAS were both related to MetS.  Whereas high cortisol concentrations were associated with an increased risk of MetS, high DHEAS concentrations appeared protective.  By far the strongest associations with MetS were observed for the cortisol:DHEAS ratio; the higher the ratio the greater the risk of having MetS. The ratio was also significantly related to four of the five MetS components.  Conclusions: The cortisol:DHEAS ratio is positively associated with MetS.

Participants completed a questionnaire measuring symptoms of anxiety and depression and social support was assessed. Older adults exhibited a significantly reduced awakening response, overall cortisol levels, area under the curve (AUC) and diurnal slopes than younger adults, resulting in a flatter diurnal rhythm. Younger adults with higher depression scores had significantly higher overall cortisol and higher levels upon awakening and 30 min post-awakening. In the younger adults, anxiety and depression correlated positively with AUC and the cortisol awakening response (CAR). Older adults with lower social support had a reduced AUC where younger adults with lower social support displayed a larger AUC.

Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed at rest and during an acute mental arithmetic stress task.  First, depression, though a putative risk factor for cardiovascular disease, does not appear to confer this risk via exaggerated reactivity, as it was negatively related to reactivity.

In the present research, we were interested in understanding the role of passion in the adoption of moral behavior in achievement settings. It was predicted that the two facets of pride (authentic and hubristic; Tracy \u0026 Robins, 2007) would mediate the passion-moral behavior relationship. Specifically, because people who are passionate about a given activity are highly involved in it, it was postulated that they should typically do well and thus experience high levels of pride when engaged in the activity. However, it was also hypothesized that while both types of passion should be conducive to authentic pride, only OP should lead to hubristic pride. Finally, in line with past research on pride (Carver, Sinclair, \u0026 Johnson, 2010; Tracy et al., 2009), only hubristic pride was expected to negatively predict moral behavior, while authentic pride was expected to positively predict moral behavior.

The design of motion preservation devices, used to replace degenerated intervertebral discs, is commonly based on a low-friction, ball-and-socket-articulating joint.

Political analysis offers an understanding of what might otherwise appear to be exclusively managerial or capacity problems. The articles in this special issue of PMR contribute to three main aspects of this new literature on the political economy of service provision: how the incentives of elites are formed and affect whether, to whom and how services are provided; how top-down and bottom-up systems of accountability may act and also interact to affect incentives; and the effect of service provision on state-society relations. The analysis in this and the following articles suggests that the politics of service provision should be understood as a cycle of causation: politics affect the policy, governance and implementation of services, but in turn service provision is a theatre of politics and affects citizen formation and the development of state capacity and legitimacy. Taken as a whole, the articles suggest that a political perspective enables new insights into the causes of weak service provision, and how it can be improved.","bibo:AuthorList":["Batley, Richard","McCourt, Willy","Mcloughlin, Claire"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, cholesterol, blood pressure, height, and weight were measured at a 3-day medical examination in 1986.  In linear regression models that adjusted for age and then additionally for circumstantial, socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health factors, poor cognitive ability in early adulthood was associated with greater erythrocyte sedimentation rate in middle age, β \u003d -.09.  Thus, it would appear that not only does systemic inflammation affect cognition, but also that poor cognitive ability earlier in life increases the risk of developing inflammation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Phillips, Anna C.","Batty, G.

From military service files, telephone interviews, and a medical examination, occupational, socio-demographic, and health data were collected. One-year prevalence of MDD and GAD was determined through a diagnostic interview schedule based on the DSM-IV criteria.  Contemporary morning fasted cortisol and DHEAS concentrations were determined. Analyses of covariance were run, first with adjustment for age and then additionally adjusting for a range of candidate confounders.\r\nResults:   In fully adjusted analyses, there was evidence of lower basal cortisol levels in individuals with MDD and co-morbid MDD and GAD than those with GAD alone or no diagnosis.\r\nConclusion:   This suggests that MDD and its comorbidity can also be characterised by low as well as high cortisol levels. A profitable line of future research might be to examine cortisol and DHEAS levels in more representative samples including older participants and women with and without MDD, GAD, and other psychiatric diagnoses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Phillips, Anna C.","Batty, G.

The present study tested the hypothesis that exercise dependency would be   similarly associated with blunted   reactivity.  Young   female exercisers (N \u003d 219) were screened by questionnaire for exercise dependence. Ten women with probable exercise dependence and 10 non dependent controls were selected for laboratory stress testing.  Cardiovascular activity and salivary cortisol were measured at rest and in response to a 10-min mental arithmetic stress task. The exercise dependent women showed blunted cardiac reactions to the stress task and blunted cortisol at 10, 20, and 30 minute post stress exposure. These effects could not be accounted for in terms of group differences in stress task   performance, nor   could the cardiac effects be attributed to group differences in cardio- respiratory ﬁtness. It would seem that low stress reactivity is characteristic of a wide range of dependencies, and is not conﬁned to substance dependence.

In a forced-choice paradigm, two- and three-year-olds preferred interpretations with HAS/LOCATED relations, while five-year-olds and adults showed no preference for either interpretation. We discuss possible explanations\r\nfor this preference and its relation to another word learning bias that is based on perceptual features of the referent objects, i.e. the shape bias.

The effects of various electrospinning process parameters on the thermal properties, especially the crystallinity of the electrospun fibers were investigated. Thermal analysis of the fibers revealed that they exhibited degree of crystallinity ranging from 23% to 46% while that for the as-received granules was approximately 37%, suggesting that the crystallinity of electrospun PLLA fibres can be controlled by optimizing the electrospinning process. This finding is very important because crystallinity affects polymer properties such as degradation, stiffness,yield stress, modulus and tensile strength, solubility, optical and electrical properties which will in turn affect the behavior of these materials when they are utilized in energy,environment, defense and security applications. The results presented in this paper show that the degree of crystallinity of the electrospun fibers decreased with increasing the polymer solution concentration. Furthermore, an optimum electrospinning voltage at which maximum degree of crystallinity can be obtained was observed. At voltages higher or lower than the optimum electrospinning voltage, the degree of rystallinity will decrease or increase,respectively.

Female students (N \u003d 455) were screened using two validated eating disorder questionnaires. Twelve women with disordered eating, including self-induced vomiting, and 12 healthy controls were selected for laboratory stress testing. Salivary cortisol and cardiovascular activity, via Doppler imaging and semi-automatic blood pressure monitoring, were measured at resting baseline and during and after exposure to a 10-min mental arithmetic stress task. Compared to controls the disordered eating group showed blunted cortisol, cardiac output, heart rate, and stroke volume reactions to the acute stress, as well as an attenuated vasodilatory reaction. These effects could not be accounted for in terms of group differences in stress task performance, subjective task impact/engagement, age, BMI, neuroticism, cardiorespiratory fitness, or co-morbid exercise dependence.
