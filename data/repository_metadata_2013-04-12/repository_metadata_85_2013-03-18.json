Comment is invited from managers of all repository platforms to share experience of the demands of the processes involved in supporting research assessment at an institutional level. \r\n\r\nThe aim of institutional repositories has focused on serving the interests of faculty – researchers and teachers – by collecting their intellectual outputs for long-term access, preservation and management. However, experience shows that in order to attain the engagement of the faculty, it is necessary to obtain the support of the institutional management. But in order to gain management support, a repository has to demonstrate a measureable and effective contribution to current management agendas and concerns – e.g. research management or research assessment.\r\n\r\nSuch contributions are achievable, but only if the repository fulfils a number of criteria that are in addition to its usual library-faculty roles. This document lists the success criteria as distilled from the authors\u0027 recent experience.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carr, Leslie","White, Wendy","Miles, Susan","Mortimer, Bill"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9322815,"sim:weight":0.365046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.34796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.344127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.338234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.320383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.318168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.318168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.318168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.318168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.318168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.318168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.318168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.318168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.318168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.318168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.318168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.318168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.318168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.318168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17123,"sim:weight":0.317897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

DiPP was initiated in 2003 by the Ministry of Innovation NRW to support novel forms of scholarly communication and provides a technical, legal and organisational framework to scholars. Starting with 8 there are now 14 publication projects from various disciplines using the well established format of an electronic journal. The platform is run and developed by the Library Service Centre (hbz) of NRW.\r\rFedora was chosen as a service layer due to its scalability, extensibility and the availability of an OAI interface. Since fedora lacks a user friendly GUI, the Content Management System Plone, based on the web application server Zope was selected to build the frontend of the publication system. Special content types have been developed, which store its content in the fedora repository instead of Zopes own database, the ZODB. Plone/Zope itself is written in Python. Via a webservice-layer Fedora-Api function calls are mapped between digital objects in the repository and plone content types, the first step of the integration of Fedora into Plone. On this foundation it was possible to build a publication platform with a fine grained security and user management, easy versioning of content, customizable workflows and individual design  of the journals website.\r\rIn the presentation we will show how the python modules were generated, how the functionality of the repository is made available in the content management system and what other services are connected via webservices, like URN assignment, document conversion, etc. Finally, a few examples of Open Access Journal using our platform are presented.","bibo:AuthorList":["Reimer, Peter"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930624,"sim:weight":0.270297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933614,"sim:weight":0.263663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932714,"sim:weight":0.248993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930966,"sim:weight":0.230005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27910,"sim:weight":0.222729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.216555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15592,"sim:weight":0.202444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98772,"sim:weight":0.19258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930615,"sim:weight":0.192344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.191417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15616,"sim:weight":0.186263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931253,"sim:weight":0.176013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930696,"sim:weight":0.17531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9322815,"sim:weight":0.171208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.170799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2729964,"sim:weight":0.167573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710133,"sim:weight":0.163557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710181,"sim:weight":0.158535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934670,"sim:weight":0.156413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.153357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At the same time, the scale of the data increased, bringing other challenges and concerns.\r\rWe believe CrystalEye is important to the repositories community because it could not have been achieved using the prevalent centralised repository approach, because the context and first steps are typical of \\\"small science\\\" research, and because we believe there is a key role for initiatives such as CrystalEye in the repository ecology.\r\rThis presentation traces the evolution of CrystalEye, and discusses: -\r\r    * The repository-like features in CrystalEye\r    * Lessons learnt - the technologies, standards and practises that allow for organic growth, and those that prevent it.\r    * The implications for other \\\"small science\\\" projects.\r    * The implications for institutional repositories - how can efforts like CrystalEye fit into an IR approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["Downing, Jim","Day, Nick","Murray-Rust, Peter"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27910,"sim:weight":0.440562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146176,"sim:weight":0.381592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.34047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.321781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.310445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.285213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794970,"sim:weight":0.282513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930615,"sim:weight":0.277154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.275477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.274615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.266713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447666,"sim:weight":0.264036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.257749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.255318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.255291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.255291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.255291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.255291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.255291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.255291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As a graduate student trained in both Francophone Studies and Human Computer Interaction, I have created a linked set of user-centered narratives.  These interconnected scenarios describe how various stakeholders might benefit from and interact with my proposed open access system which will be enhanced by on-line participation and customization tools. The conceptual model for the Francophone Studies Open Access Repository was developed in part by insights gathered through discussions with people from diverse educational, social and cultural backgrounds. Unlike a list of system requirements or diagrams requiring subject matter expertise, scenarios can provide a common ground for discussion, enabling collaborative work among system developers and a variety of stakeholders.\r\rScenario 1 - Student created resources - Students in Louisiana audio-video record interviews with their grandparents or senior community members who speak French.  Students then upload records into the repository and establish their own copyright permissions.  Francophone community members may comment and share related stories.  (Example – Episcopal School of Acadiana high school student conducted interviews from 2006)\r\rScenario 2 - Student/Teacher/Official State Education created resources – Learning materials provided by official state approved educational sites (in French and in English) are used in the classroom. Teachers may customize this material, then create and post on-line their lesson plans and/or original activities.  Student projects could be uploaded as well, under the supervision of the teacher. (Example – Virtual Museum – Birds and Beaks French version –\rhttp://appl003.lsu.edu/natsci/education.nsf/$Content/Virtual+Museum?OpenDocument)\r\rScenario 3 - Academic resource collaboration - Academics publish articles, collaborate on projects, and have reserved discussion spaces. (Example – Professors from different universities collaborate on Cajun French Dictionary -http://www.lsu.com/UNV002.NSF/(NoteID)/1A0E8514F4831BFB86256E5B007959BF?OpenDocument.)\r\rScenario 4 - Community members, international family connections – Louisiana families with genealogical ties to people living in other francophone communities share stories, documents and commentaries about their ancestors in common.  (Example - Detraz/Hebert family – 19th century letters rediscovered in 1980.  Letters written in French by Maurice Detraz from 1880-1899 were mailed from Abbeville, Louisiana to his parents in Thonon-les-Bains, France.  This French-Louisiana family has stayed in touch across the Atlantic for over 100 years.)\r\rScenario 5 - Community members - established friendships – Cross-cultural, international friendships created in person can continue on-line.  (Example – interviews in French with people visiting Louisiana from France, Quebec, New Brunswick, and French Guyana.)\r\rScenario 6 - Community members (Special Interest Groups) - Veterans share stories of their use of French language while serving abroad in the armed forces.  (Example – Story Corps audio interview with Gerald Domingue.)\r \rScenario 7 - Community members - Seniors\u0027 voices – Audio-video interviews and presentations from Louisiana francophone seniors.  (Examples – recordings from the “Living Legends” Collection hosted by the Acadian Museum in Erath - http://www.acadianmuseum.com/legends.php - and recordings from a literacy class for native speakers of Louisiana French sponsored by the Alliance Française of Lafayette.)\r\rScenario 8 - History of French language and colonization of North America - Links to museums, libraries and special francophone projects to be provided.  Then, school and/or student created projects, additional links and discussions would be connected.  This scenario would link back to Scenario 2 in particular. (Examples – France in America - http://gallica.bnf.fr/FranceAmerique/fr/default.htm, Acadian Museum Erath - http://www.acadianmuseum.com,  La Salle Odyssey Project - http://www.museumofthecoastalbend.org/lasalle.html, and Common Routes; St. Domingue-Louisiana - at http://video.google.com)\r\rScenario 9 - Embracing Diversity – advocates francophone cultures throughout the world.  This scenario would link back to Scenarios 3, 4, and 5 in particular.  Subject matters to be addressed could include linguistic variation, such as different pronunciations, regional expressions, borrowing from other languages, and creative invention with language (Examples – froide/frette, maintenant/asteur, emel/chaoui, courriel/pourriel/A+) Additionally, contribution of resources which demonstrate examples of international cultural diversity would be encouraged. (Example Festival International of Lafayette, Louisiana - international visitors’ videos, photographs and commentaries - http://www.festivalinternational.com/site.php)\r\rScenario 10 – Links and partnerships with other repositories – With interdisciplinary studies flourishing, much material seems appropriate to more than one repository.  Hopefully, collaborative efforts will connect francophonestudiesrepository.org, africanstudiesrepository.org and other repositories of related disciplines.  Attention should be given to interoperable social networking tools, permissions, community tagging and eventually distributed storage and functionality to ensure survival of contents and systems’ reliability across repositories.\r\r[1]\\\"Both HCI [Human Computer Interaction] and SE [Software Engineering] communities have been influenced more recently by use of scenarios, examples and use cases in the design process. ...  HCI views scenarios in many different forms, ranging from rich descriptions of a systems context, to specific sequences of interaction or vision of future system usage.\\\" (Seffah, Gulliksen, et al.

Examples of such systems include: Flickr, Del.icio.us, Connotea, YouTube, LastFm. Such systems are exemplary of the Web 2.0 phenomena because they use the Internet to harness collective intelligence. Although there are issues associated with the quality of the metadata generated, there are also significant advantages including the cost benefits of leveraging community effort and enhanced search and discovery services that result from richer, more relevant metadata and rankings of resources.\rIn this paper we describe the HarvANA (Harvesting and Aggregating Networked Annotations) system that we are developing at the University of Queensland. The objective of HarvANA is to develop an efficient streamlined system (based on open standards and a set of open source services) that  can leverage the explosion of community annotation/tagging systems and exploit the resulting metadata to improve discovery and reasoning across open repositories. Within the HarvANA system, community annotations are stored on (one or more) Annotea-compliant annotation servers that are separate from the collections that they are annotating. An OAI-PMH interface, built on top of the Annotation server(s), enables periodic harvesting of  new annotations (since the last harvest). The harvested annotations are then aggregated with the institutional metadata (IM), to enrich the metadata store with community knowledge and enable more sophisticated and improved discovery services.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hunter, Jane","Khan, Imran","Chernich, Ron","Gerber, Anna"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"J Hunter, I Khan, R Chernich and A Gerber.

With expansion, however, come new challenges.  Three areas identified in the recent JISC digital repository review include handling data and other file formats in addition to text and pdf research outputs, sustainability and long-term preservation, and better integrating repositories into researchers’ work practices and the life cycle of research projects. A newly launched project, Timescapes, will create an archive of qualitative longitudinal data based at the University of Leeds and has been designed to develop and test solutions in these three areas.  The Timescapes Archive will have two components:  there will be a digital repository at Leeds that will be the receiving facility for incoming content.  This repository will be an extension of the existing MIDESS system at Leeds and explicitly designed to accommodate multi-media file formats.  This repository will support data preparation, metadata enhancement, and data sharing, both within the Timescapes team and with other authorised users.  The repository will send appropriately prepared (e.g., compliant with OAIS and DDI standards) to the UK Data Archive at the University of Essex for preservation.  Dissemination versions of files (whether produced at Leeds or UKDA) will be managed from the repository.  Thus the repository will have primary responsibility for ingest and dissemination with the UKDA handling preservation.  This paper will first address the distinctive features of the Timescapes archive and its design process.  Secondly it will discuss the implementation strategies used to date in the project.  Finally, it will report on successes and challenges encountered so far.  The project is still in its first year so all findings are tentative.  However, it is hoped that by sharing our experience early, the project will benefit from others’ experience and perhaps also be of some value to others.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bishop, Libby"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.486118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.411757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.410479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.379653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.365089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.346526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.341843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.305875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.305875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The AID is a new concept that can be used to describe the interrelations between research descriptions, research data and research publications. In The Netherlands, the research information portal NARCIS is already offering access to these three research related information sources. The interlinking of these sources will lead to the realization of the AID. Interlinking is possible by using Digital Author Identifiers, by which names of researchers (in their different roles in the information sources) can be coupled. Besides, persistent identifiers will be used to identify resources independently of their localization. The metadata schema MODS - in a stripped form - will be introduced in order to harvest information objects together with the added identifiers. Eventually, this development will yield new compound information objects that are aggregations of distinct information units. The ideas will be elaborated further within the European DRIVER II project.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hogenaar, Arjan","Steinhoff, Wilko"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":27910,"sim:weight":0.436147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.431835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930966,"sim:weight":0.42466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.409763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.396961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.306919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The central harvester hub is based at the British Library, based on EPrints 2, and will act as a single point of access to UK e-theses.  The British Library needs to make EThOS self-sustaining, and has incorporated a digitisation service into EThOS for which institutions will pay an annual subscription.  This will help to build the number of e-theses available beyond those currently being submitted and held in institutional repositories.  The combination of these two services, OAI and digitisation, has resulted in a sustainable model that can support open access to previously hidden UK postgraduate research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Russell, Jill","Awre, Chris","Troman, Anthony","Needham, Paul"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8933614,"sim:weight":0.541209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.508883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27910,"sim:weight":0.438006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732171,"sim:weight":0.419695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930615,"sim:weight":0.397117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15636,"sim:weight":0.382028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.378086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15617,"sim:weight":0.375237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.36547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15592,"sim:weight":0.350558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":36649,"sim:weight":0.343859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.335888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9322815,"sim:weight":0.334505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.318694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.314071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184265,"sim:weight":0.306669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162458,"sim:weight":0.305681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.2954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.27694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.275957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One of our earliest adopters, the Instituto Antonio Carlos Jobim, has deployed Manakin for its multimedia collections; the PolicyArchive project has used Manakin to drastically change the look-and-feel of DSpace; the Doria repository in Finland has adapted Manakin to support the multi-lingual needs of its ETD collection; and at Texas A\u0026M University Manakin is used to visualize geospatial metadata in a collection of historic maps and also to match the main library’s new website design.\r\rManakin’s introduction represented a fundamental change to the previous DSpace interface by adding the abilities to: 1) establish a unique look-and-feel, 2) brand content, 3) visualize metadata, and 4) provide modularity at the interface layer. Having lived with Manakin for a year, we are able to assess our progress toward meeting these goals. While the four original design goals were realized in the initial release of Manakin, it became apparent that certain issues had been overlooked.","bibo:AuthorList":["Phillips, Scott","Creel, James","Green, Cody","Li, Yixuan","Maslov, Alexey","Mattingly, Philip","Mikeal, Adam","Paz, Jay","Leggett, John","McFarland, Mark"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930966,"sim:weight":0.396459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.339089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.318372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.313305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.310999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.305419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.293388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184265,"sim:weight":0.289488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.275375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.275126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.270318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.264071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.261709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88591,"sim:weight":0.241132,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.239744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100608,"sim:weight":0.201803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The goal of the aDORe federation architecture is to facilitate a uniform manner for client applications to discover and access content objects available in a group of distributed repositories.  This is achieved by means of a 3-Tier architecture. Tier-3 provides client applications with a single point of access to all content available in the federation, irrespective of the actual location of that content in federated repositories.  In order to realize this, the architecture requires all federated repositories to implement the same, minimal set of machine interfaces to make their content accessible. These repository interfaces constitute Tier-1 of the architecture.  Moreover, the architecture requires the introduction of a middle Tier, Tier-2, consisting of two shared infrastructure components that keep the books on content objects, repositories, and repository interfaces in the federation.  These shared infrastructure components minimally expose one machine interface each. In order to respond to client requests, the federation’s single point of access interacts with these interfaces as well as with the interfaces exposed by the content repositories.","bibo:AuthorList":["Van de Sompel, Herbert","Ryan, Ryan","Balakireva, Lyudmila"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8933614,"sim:weight":0.415298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27910,"sim:weight":0.355686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930624,"sim:weight":0.303901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15583,"sim:weight":0.27743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930966,"sim:weight":0.272512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930615,"sim:weight":0.269664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.252699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.24954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.233677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.229984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70186,"sim:weight":0.219878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.206322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998079,"sim:weight":0.189935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184265,"sim:weight":0.181076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.178993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.175328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100608,"sim:weight":0.150081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

More specifically, we discuss the recent development of the ORCA (Online Research Collections Australia) Registry, which illustrates the practical application of registry standards in the Australian context to create a combined collections and services registry. Additionally, we discuss its use of the ISO2146 (Registry Services for Libraries and Related Organizations) standard. The ISO2146 standard provides an information model that identifies the objects and data elements needed for the collaborative construction of registries of all types. We demonstrate how this standard was implemented, particularly how it was used it as the basis for developing a registry metadata interchange format for harvesting and exchanging collection-level metadata to and from ORCA-Registry instances. Similarly, we discuss how this format incorporates the Dublin Core Collections Application Profile (DCCAP). Finally, we report on recent discussions (Dec. 2008) to establish interoperability between leading registry services to explore the possibility of establishing a global network of registries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burton, Adrian","Blackall, Chris"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8933614,"sim:weight":0.32568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27910,"sim:weight":0.266527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930966,"sim:weight":0.240576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9322815,"sim:weight":0.24052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.232725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.227662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.209037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98980,"sim:weight":0.202166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.196512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934482,"sim:weight":0.187986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184265,"sim:weight":0.185977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100397,"sim:weight":0.185166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15592,"sim:weight":0.184188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15636,"sim:weight":0.181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.178838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.167568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.160145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.160145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000257,"sim:weight":0.147999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

MESUR\u0027s investigation is conducted on the basis of a large-scale reference data set that combines usage, citation and bibliographic data obtained from a wide variety of publishers, aggregators and institutions. \r\rScholarly evaluation is at this point mostly conducted on the basis of metrics based on citation statistics, e.g. article citation counts, the Impact Factor and the h-index. Although citation data, possibly due to its origin in the published, peer-reviewed literature, has acquired an aura of validity and reliability, a number of shortcomings have been repeatedly identified that affect open repositories. Publication delays can cause citation data to lag scholarly developments by significant periods of time leading to an under appreciation of services that shorten the scholarly communication cycle. Most importantly, citation data frequently ignores the growing body of grey literature or non textual scholarly objects that exist outside the realm of scholarly journals and can thus not assess the growing impact of scholars that publish their research outside the limited set of journals tracked by Thomson Scientific or any particular commercial publisher collections.\r\rIt has become apparent from the evolving MESUR research that usage data, in particular when aggregated across a multitude of scholarly information sources, is a promising complement to traditional citation data.

At the behest of major journals and societies in evolutionary biology, we have begun development of a repository called Dryad for the preservation, discovery and sharing of data underlying published works in the field.","bibo:AuthorList":["Scherle, Ryan","Carrier, Sarah","Greenberg, Jane","Lapp, Hillmar","Thompson, Abbey","Vision, Todd","White, Hollie"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9322815,"sim:weight":0.591786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27910,"sim:weight":0.581495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":384858,"sim:weight":0.47775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.429656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60055,"sim:weight":0.428081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.423092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.407344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.40156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.367136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.366759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.346361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.329267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.317267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.315648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.313429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.307633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.300114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.300114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.293277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58019,"sim:weight":0.277946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":6189609,"ep:Repository":85,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"DRIVER: Improving access to European research","bibo:abstract":"With the growth of repositories, many valuable services such as OAIster [1] and BASE [2] have been established to search and retrieve bibliographic records (metadata). However, items held in repositories are sometimes hidden behind several intermediate pages, obscured by authorization procedures, not fully presented, or not retrievable at all. \r\rA unified approach is needed to manage this challenging and evolving repository landscape. This poster will describe the DRIVER (Digital Repository Infrastructure Vision for European Research) project which aims to provide such a unified approach [3]. \r\rAims\rDRIVER is a multi-phase effort. The initial phase, DRIVER I, concentrated on providing access to textual scientific output, such as articles, scientific/technical reports, preprints and working papers from countries in the DRIVER testbed:  Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. The current phase, DRIVER II, expands on this to include a wider range of materials from all EU countries.\r\rStudies\rWithin the DRIVER I project, a number of strategic and coordinated studies on digital repositories and related topics have been carried out to identify the current state of development, best practices and needs of the European repository community. The results of these studies will be discussed in this poster.\r\rGuidelines\rThe landscape of digital repositories is multifaceted, with respect to different countries, different resources such as text, data or multimedia, different technological platforms, different metadata policies etc. \rFor this purpose the project has drawn up the DRIVER Guidelines for Content Providers: Exposing textual resources with OAI-PMH [4]. The main goals are to provide guidance for managers of new repositories in defining their local data management policies for textual resources; for managers of existing repositories to take steps towards improved services; and for developers of repository platforms to add supportive functionalities in future versions. The poster will provide further information on the Guidelines and on a validation tool being developed to assist repository managers check their repository for compliance.\r\rInfrastructure\rThe DRIVER guidelines take a ‘top-down’ approach, in trying to ensure that repository data is exposed in a standard way. At the same time, the DRIVER infrastructure takes a ‘bottom-up’ approach and provides the technology and infrastructure to harvest content from multiple repositories and manage its transformation into a common and uniform ‘shared information space’. \rRe-use is a key feature of DRIVER. Traditional approaches to service development have involved each service provider deploying a new system with high maintenance costs (possibly installing, customizing services and constructing from scratch, i.e. harvesting/cleaning, a new information space). However in DRIVER, service providers can reduce costs and effort by relying on the DRIVER infrastructure and cooperating in order to populate and re-use the global information space as needed to develop search, citation and other services. The poster will provide additional information on the development and facilities of the infrastructure.\r\rBenefits \rDRIVER has wide-ranging benefits for both service providers and end users of the DRIVER infrastructure. Service providers will be able to use the DRIVER information space to access Europe’s repositories and to build national, regional or subject-specific services. End users can use services built on the DRIVER infrastructure to access a broad spectrum of disciplines and topics. Due to the work of DRIVER these services will be able to ensure effective searches and retrieval of high quality full text content in an efficient manner.\r\rDRIVER Community \rDRIVER is working to increase awareness of Open Access and repositories among those directly involved in research in Europe as well as raising awareness of the issues among the general public. \rDRIVER is working with national groups e.g. Irish, Spanish  and Belgium repositories, to facilitate the growth of national repository networks.\rDRIVER will support the development of a Confederation of European Digital Repositories to act as a long-term forum to facilitate collaboration and the development of the repository community. \r\rSummary \rThe initial phase of DRIVER focused on the support of institutional repositories and textual content in repositories. In DRIVER-II, efforts will be made to strengthen the repository community and subject communities will feature more strongly in the project. DRIVER technical developments will focus on the development and enhancement of services for specific communities. In DRIVER-II, the technical focus will expand from the management of textual content in repositories to also include the management of complex objects such as data and multimedia. \r\rReferences\r1.

{"identifier":6189613,"ep:Repository":85,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Digital archive JYX also takes care of copyrights","bibo:abstract":"In general, current digital archives are designed and implemented to support publishing, management and delivery of digital content. Despite the improvements of the information systems in recent years, there is only a handful of digital archives in the Nordic countries that provide means to manage and control copyrights. One major reason why managing copyrights is neglected is lack of software tools to perform such time consuming effort.\r\n\r\nDuring the deployment of our digital archive in the University of Jyväskylä, we noticed that publishing always has to do with agreeing on copyrights. Copyrights and usage rights must be taken care of and expressed in connection with the content or its metadata. One simple way to do this is to add a piece of information in the metadata field or a link which contains the information about the rights to use the material, e.g. a link to a Creative Commons –license. \r\n\r\nHowever, we found that the publishing and related copyright ecosystem is not this straightforward. The publishing agreements tend to be complex and vary depending on the type of the content. For example, there might be a need to capture the details of an agreement dealing with a particular online video, which can only be used for certain purposes, in a certain course, in a certain technical environment, and for the use of which the author is paid a remuneration, etc. \r\n\r\nWe approached this complexity by examining the common boundaries between content lifecycle and contract lifecycle. Once the points of interaction in the processes were discovered and defined, we introduced and deployed an electronic copyright management systems (ECMS) to the JYX Digital Archive developed in the Jyväskylä University Library. We refer to ECMS as an information system capable of managing the lifecycle of the contracts appearing as publishing agreements, usage licenses and related structured information.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the making of the publishing contract becomes an essential part of the digital publishing process. The system also enables the automatic control of the rights, permissions and restrictions. Since the contents of the agreement is described both in “human” language and in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), the use of the materials can be controlled and limited automatically by the contract management system or the use can be controlled by the DSpace system according the terms that has been defined in the contracts.\r\n\r\nJYX (jyx.jyu.fi) is the Digital Archive of the University of Jyväskylä opened in November 2007. It puts into practise the idea of linking together a contract management system and a digital archive. In JYX the combination of an archive and ECMS is carried out by DSpace and a dynamic digital contract management system DrM, created by a Finnish company DrElma Ltd. When the material is published, its user rights can be specified using the dynamic contract template. Conversely, when searching the material in the archive, the abstract of the contract is presented to the user telling him/her the conditions of using this material. \r\n\r\nJYX was partly created within The Finnish Publishing Channel project (2007 – 2008) www.vy.fi/vomyke, which received funding from the Finnish Ministry of Education. The Finnish Publishing Channel project promotes the idea of combining a digital archive  and ECMS to national use. \r\n\r\nAlthough the strategic starting point in the project was to improve the joint use of online educational materials, the publishing services built in the project have turned out to be useful in managing the agreements of other materials published online, too (e.g. masters’ theses, research materials). It is very important to specify the rights to use of those. \r\n\r\nThe challenges for the year 2008 are to make structured agreement models, build the interfaces to other systems (e.g. library search portals, publishing archives) and expand the use of the concept carried out in this project to partners outside the project.  \r\n\r\nIn the presentation we will tackle the questions mentioned above and the solutions found in the project. The pilot system of JYX will also be demonstrated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heikkinen, Risto","Pitkänen, Pertti","Olsbo, Pekka","Luoma, Eetu"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.381744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.349572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.337831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.316237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15592,"sim:weight":0.310245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89658,"sim:weight":0.285662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.283318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795073,"sim:weight":0.278944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.27751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26473,"sim:weight":0.269947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27910,"sim:weight":0.266785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.259864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151792,"sim:weight":0.254454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.253746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.251759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.24118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.240095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.234824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.206078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It has advanced in the past three or four years with more frequent initiatives related to repositories and open/free journals. The 246 registered signatories of the Berlin Declaration include 21 Spanish institutions, most of which signed it in 2006. The Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR) and the Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR) have in their records 32 and 22 open access repositories from Spain, respectively, but these figures do not represent the real ones, since there are more that have not registered yet (see BUSCA REPOSITORIOS ), and others that are listed in those directories which are not repositories but journals or aggregators The oldest repository in Spain Tesis Doctorals en Xarxa  (‘Networked Doctoral Theses’) was created in year 2001, but most of the Spanish institutional repositories emerged at the end of 2004 or the beginning of 2005 (Melero, 2006). Nevertheless, there is evidence that more have been created and announced in recent months (Melero, 2007). These data do not correlate with the DRIVER I inventory study in which the response of the 12 invited (those registered at that time in OpenDOAR)  was very low (3 answers). However, the international presence of our repositories, measured as participations in OA initiatives, is increasing as described below. Respect to Spanish forums, related to repositories and in general to the OA movement, at least there are 3 very active: the OS-Repositorios (\u003d Open Science-Repositories), GUDE (Dspace  Spanish  users group) Open Access Madrimasd ( A. Lopez’s blog  supported by  Madrid Regional Government and ). The first two groups hold meetings and workshops periodically about hot topics related to repository issues.\rBased on OpenDOAR records, Dspace and ePrints are the software used most to implement repositories. Most Spanish repositories (78 %) are institutional, mainly created by universities. The commonest types of repositories are those archiving conference and workshop papers, theses and dissertations, and research papers (pre and post prints). The growth of Spanish repositories with time, from data provided by ROAR, seems to fall into three types: plateau, stairstep and steady growth. The clearest growth behaviour is the one of TDX, which has followed the steady pattern. The first model responds to repositories in which digital objects are deposited regularly along the time, the second and the third ones are those in which uploads are done  by batches of different size  at different  intervals of time, as has been observed previously in other repositories (Davis and Connolly, 2007).\r In Spain there are different initiatives, at regional and national level, to develop services on top of the existing repositories. At the regional level, the Autonomous Communities of Catalonia and Madrid are the most active, because their respective territories account for most of the existing institutional repositories in Spain. The services are implemented through the Library Consortia of each Autonomous Community.\rThe Autonomous Community of Madrid and the “Consorcio Madroño” (Libraries of the public Universities of Madrid and UNED) have created a regional scientific portal, “e-ciencia”, which gives free access to academic research output in the Region of Madrid from the 7 participant universities and the Spanish National Research Council. Currently the portal contains about 19.000 documents, 100% open access. The documents are mostly textual (except from a collection of about 8.000 audio/video documents from the UNED library) and only academic and scientific in scope. The portal offers a central search service but is also developing such other services as a regional citation service, metadata export, and statistics. The repositories have created sets by type of document and subject to offer; in the near future there will be thematic search engines and gateways. It  also offers copyright issues advice to libraries and researchers. It has translated the “licence to publish” from the Zwolle Project. The portal is also helping the participant institutions to work together with common standards; the participants’ repositories are already working in compliance with the Driver guidelines. This project  is strongly supported by the Government of the Autonomous Community of Madrid, that as a funding agency it has implemented the first and the only “open access” policy in Spain: it is only a recommendation to the researchers it funds to self-archive in the Institutional repositories harvested by the portal, but it is a promising step that opens up the way to other agencies and organizations in Spain. \rThe Catalan Consortia, CBUC, from the Autonomous Community of Catalonia, works with a slightly different model: it has created two aggregating or inter-institutional repositories: \r“Recercat”, a cooperative repository of digital documents, works as a common institutional repository for the universities in Catalonia that do not have their own local institutional repository and at the same time it harvests the content of the universities that do have their own institutional repository. It contains research literature from universities and researching centres of Catalonia, like preprints, communications in congress, research reports, working papers, university final projects, technical reports, etc. (2.778 documents).  TDX is also a cooperative repository of theses from different universities of Spain (19 universities are currently participating, 5.240 thesis). It does not work as a service provider (it does not harvest other repositories) but as a common data repository where different universities of Spain deposit their thesis. Both repositories are 100% open access.\rAt the national level the initiative is leaded by the Network of Academic and Research University Libraries of Spain, REBIUN. Co-funded by the Minister of Education, REBIUN has created the national open access research portal, “Recolecta”, just released in February, 2008. The portal has been inspired by DareNet in the Netherlands, the information platform open-access.net in Germany, and DRIVER. The portal wants to be not only the central access and dissemination point of Spanish research, but to give the development of institutional repositories in Spain a sense of a national endeavour, to make the diverse landscape of Spanish repositories a true infrastructure, and to increase capacity of influence in terms of open access policies. The portal will establish some recommendations in order to be harvested and some specifications to participate in the services which will be implemented; and these specifications will be based on the DRIVER guidelines and the DINI Certificate. For this reason, the project has translated both documents. At the same time, copyright issues remain a key problem for the success of the population of our repositories, and the portal will offer advice on the matter. It has translated the Sherpa/ROMEO interface (thanks to the kind help of Frank Schulz).","bibo:AuthorList":["Melero, Reme","Lopez Medina, Alicia","Prats, Jordi"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8933614,"sim:weight":0.52793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97888,"sim:weight":0.447989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930615,"sim:weight":0.427459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10671,"sim:weight":0.410059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2737426,"sim:weight":0.382284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27910,"sim:weight":0.380955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934642,"sim:weight":0.364626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86204,"sim:weight":0.364626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.360626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9322815,"sim:weight":0.341834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15592,"sim:weight":0.296794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.295034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.293855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.293855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.280559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.26986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.264331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.249195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.240997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26473,"sim:weight":0.22697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":6189637,"ep:Repository":85,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Reliable Long Term Archiving Storage Architecture","bibo:abstract":"While the Open Archive Information System (OAIS) model has become the de facto standard for preservation archives, the design and implementation of a reliable long term archive lacks adopted technology standards and design best practices.  This paper presentation is intended to provide a recommendation for standards implementation and best practices for a viable, cost effective, and reliable long term archiving storage architecture.  This architecture is based on a combination of open source and commercially support software and systems.  An open source environment is likely to provide long-term viability.  \r\n\r\nAlthough several operating systems currently exist, the logical choice for an archive storage system is an open source operating system, of which there are two primary choices today: Linux and Solaris. There are many varieties of Linux available and supported by nearly all system manufacturers. The Solaris Operating System is freely downloadable from Sun Microsystems.  Many variants of the Linux operating system and Solaris are available with support on a fee base.  \r\n\r\nThe Hierarchical Storage System, or HSM, is a key software element of the archive.  The HSM provides one of the key components that contributes to reliability by through data integrity checks and  automated file migration.  The HSM provides the ability to automate making multiples copies of files, auditing files for errors based on checksum, rejecting bad copies of files and making new copies based on the results of those audits.  The HSM also provides the ability to read in an older file format and write-out a new file format thus migrating the format and application information required to ensure archival integrity of the stored content.  The automation of these functions provides for improved performance and reduced operating costs.  \r\n\r\nThe format of the file written to the archive should also be open. The open file format with the longest use in existence is a UNIX file format TAR.  TAR and TARBALL files are readable without the application that wrote them.  The open file format is should be a required component to any long term archive.  There is currently no commercial archive solution available with a long term archive guarantee.   The Archive Storage Architecture must take this into account in order to ensure long term adaptability to advances in technology.  The archive model itself must be open in order to adapt to changes in applications, storage, and media.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sun StorageTek Storage Archive Manager (SAM) software provides the core functionality of the recommended Archive Storage Architecture.  SAM provides policy based data classification and placement across a multitude of storage devices from high speed disk, low cost disk, or tape.  SAM also simplifies data management by providing centralized meta-data.  SAM is a self-protecting file system with continuous file integrity checks.  \r\n\r\nThe digital content archive provides the content repository (or digital vault) within Sun\u0027s award-winning Digital Asset Management Reference Architecture (DAM RA). DAM RA enables digital workflow and the content archive provides permanent access to digital content files. \r\n\r\nWith SAM software, the files are stored, tracked, and retrieved based on the archival requirements. Files are seamlessly and transparently available to other services.  SAM software creates virtually limitless capacity.  Its scalability allows for continual growth throughout the archive with support for all data types.  The policy based SAM software stores and manages data for compliance and non-compliance archives using a tiered storage approach with integrated disk and tape into a seamless storage solution, SAM software simplifies the archive storage.   Allows you to automate data management policies based on file attributes. You can manage data according to the storage and access requirements of each user on the system and decide how data is grouped, copied, and accessed based on the needs of the application and the users. Helps you maximize return on investments by storing data on the media type appropriate for the life cycle of the data and simplifying system administration. \r\n\r\nThe Sun StorageTek 5800 provides the core hardware storage platform for the Reliable Archive Storage Architecture.  The ST5800 object storage system provides data protection designed specifically for long-term preservation.  The ST5800 provides simplified management of a highly scalable and flexible platform.  The Sun StorageTek 5800 is the first in a line of 3rd generation object storage systems optimized to store large amounts of digital content with some very unique capabilities including extensive metadata facilities that describe the object being stored, and an architecture that allows it to process locally the format of the object being retrieved or stored.\r\n\r\nThe ST5800 uses a multi-cell based symmetric, clustered architecture. Within a cell, all storage, control, data, and metadata path operations are distributed across the cluster to provide both reliability and performance scaling. Each storage node is independent of all other nodes, and there\u0027s complete symmetry in both the hardware and software on each storage node.   The Sun StorageTek 5800 provides a comprehensive defensive strategy to corruption and data loss due to bit rot by integrating bit rot protection and real-time checksums. Reed-Solomon RAID 6 protection, advanced data placement algorithms, and self-healing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rajecki, Keith"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The Action configurations are XML files that can be named and organized hierarchically in the file system and edited manually or using TIAMAT. Later, aggregate actions should be created to represent the individual ingest processes. The aggregate actions are then registered with the detector along with the conditions under which a new ingest occurs. When new material is submitted for ingest, the detector notifies the engine to execute the appropriate aggregate Action, then each Action in the sequence executes in turn. Every action creates a backup of the data before making alterations and logs its activities so that they may be undone if there is a problem later on. Each action has a watchdog in case it takes longer than expected to complete, and a responsible party to notify if it cannot complete successfully. The engine tracks the progress of each ingest and in the case of an unexpected termination restarts all of the actions that were running. \rOutcome \rThe outcome of this project will be a simplified workflow engine that works with a vanilla instance of Fedora. Because the service is designed to run external scripts, it can be customized to any local need, such as integration with our naming service, our search service, or metadata modifications required by our archivists. \rDescription of Poster \rThe poster will briefly define the ingest problem and provide an illustration of proposed TIAMAT workflow. The poster will display the steps involved in ingesting content into our repository including the outcomes of the steps and possible errors. A schematic of the architecture describing the proposed solution with underlying technologies will be presented. Use cases at Tufts and their work-flow in ingest service will also be explained.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kumar, Anoop","Kaplan, Deborah","Rubinger, Benjamin"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.291582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.287237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.281643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.273215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.261989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.25836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.253189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.244092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.243094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70186,"sim:weight":0.241757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.229772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931434,"sim:weight":0.223372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998016,"sim:weight":0.211391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.210764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59097,"sim:weight":0.177429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100608,"sim:weight":0.174314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Specifying what needs to be preserved by institutions – as part of institutional memory or for legal purposes – can assist in identifying priorities within records management.

VUE not only provides a visual environment for structuring, presenting, and sharing digital information but also viewing digital resources along with their metadata.  The poster will demonstrate some of new the features of VUE that allow it to seamlessly connect and search multiple digital repositories.  We will also present few concept maps created using digital objects from repositories.\r\rConcept maps have been a part of the constructivist landscape of education since the early 1980’s and research has demonstrated that concept maps are superb tools for facilitating learning. Concept-mapping software such as Cmap developed by the University of West Florida and Inspiration are concept mapping tools that have been used extensively by teachers.  While these and other products share a number of common features, they lack important functionality necessary to maximize the curricular uses of digital library content.\r\rVisual Understanding Environment (VUE), shown in Figure 1, is a learning application that facilitates thinking with and learning from digital resources. Essentially VUE is a concept mapping application that facilitates structuring and semantically connecting electronic content drawn from file systems, the World Wide Web or a digital repository. \r\rVUE is a concept mapping application designed as an integrated digital library application. It allows users to search, browse, retrieve content from digital repositories, and upload resources into these systems. It provides a means for users to construct clear pathways through the resources linked together on a concept map and the ability to control the sequence in which resources are viewed. A complex map of linked resources can be made more accessible to domain novices by offering explicit guidance or a single set of resources that takes on multiple meanings depending upon which pathways are created. These features, important within instructional contexts, are currently lacking in available mapping software.  \r\rVUE has been successfully integrated with several digital repositories including   Tufts Digital Library based on Fedora,  ARTStor, Cisco VMS, JStor,  MERLOT A search or federated search can be performed on all the repositories collectively or on individual repositories to retrieve digital objects.  Results returned from the search can be viewed along with the metadata of the digital objects and the objects can be easily incorporated into a concept map.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kumar, Anoop","Schwertner, Nikolai"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":6189670,"sim:weight":0.441792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930966,"sim:weight":0.305001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.290106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.279488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.232185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.216299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.215665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.20884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930973,"sim:weight":0.208653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.189301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.18666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271203,"sim:weight":0.176605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100608,"sim:weight":0.161857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933440,"sim:weight":0.142038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002988,"sim:weight":0.127341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is particularly the case for repositories based on Fedora, with its highly flexible content model architecture. This data represents a major investment, and in many cases is irreplaceable; there is thus a pressing need for implementing preservation functionality in repositories to ensure long-term access, and for scalability reasons this must be as automated as possible.\r\rThe SOAPI project is addressing this need by developing a flexible toolkit for implementing automated and semi-automated workflows supporting the preservation of complex digital material in repositories. Our approach is not to develop a monolithic tool, but a set of modular web services, each encapsulating a well-defined unit of preservation functionality, which can be configured and combined to produce workflows. \r\rThe workflows are implemented using the jBPM workflow engine, and generic interfaces are created for particular categories of action to facilitate the simple plug-and-play of specialised third part software, e.g. for file format conversion and metadata extraction. Workflows can thus be created for, e.g., (i) ingesting compound digital objects, checking object integrity, generating metadata, normalising files to suitable preservation formats, and outputting Archival Information Packages in the form of METS (or FOXML) documents, or (ii) post-ingest preservation activities such as event-driven workflows that verify the fixity of digital objects, check for format obsolescence, and take remedial action if necessary.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hedges, Mark"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931117,"sim:weight":0.44931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15592,"sim:weight":0.420166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.404512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4183810,"sim:weight":0.390825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732171,"sim:weight":0.380803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184265,"sim:weight":0.380393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15583,"sim:weight":0.379045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512492,"sim:weight":0.377128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55319,"sim:weight":0.376004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933369,"sim:weight":0.363557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932714,"sim:weight":0.363425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932070,"sim:weight":0.358387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933614,"sim:weight":0.331176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.31617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934670,"sim:weight":0.305611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27910,"sim:weight":0.303347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15655,"sim:weight":0.280836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.275869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9322815,"sim:weight":0.271941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.271491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the Fedora repository for Indiana University’s Digital Library Program, intended to serve both access and preservation needs, we store an increasing number of object types representing items ranging from scanned books to documentary photographs to three-dimensional puzzles. Other object types, including digital video and audio, are also on the horizon.  In addition, we store objects representing more abstract concepts, such as a piece of sheet music for which various editions may have been scanned or an archival collection containing many component objects. Metadata useful for finding a given item may exist at any of these levels, and many items also contain searchable full text content. Besides simply having a wide variety of objects, collection purposes, access models, and user needs vary widely across the contents of the repository.

{"identifier":6189674,"ep:Repository":85,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Item","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Building Personal Collections and Networks of Digital Objects in a Fedora Repository Using VUE","bibo:abstract":"Building Personal Collections and Networks of Digital Objects in a Fedora Repository Using VUE\rAnoop Kumar and Nikolai Schwertner\rUIT-Academic Technology\rTufts University\r16 Dearborn Road, Somerville, MA 02145\r\rIntroduction\rDigital repository technology has evolved over the past decades enabling streamlined creation and sharing of digital content. Current implementations make it feasible to setup repository infrastructures not only for large institutions but also for smaller groups and individual users. Yet, one of the difficulties in the adoption of the technology remains the relative scarcity of powerful tools for publishing content to digital repositories. With this in mind, we developed a Fedora publishing module allowing instant ingestion of VUE-generated content maps in a Fedora repository. We take advantage of the relationship facilities within Fedora to build a knowledge base of interrelated VUE maps and resources though user contributions. \r\rFedora is a flexible repository system with powerful digital object model for managing institutional repository needs [1].  Fedora has become one of the popular repository systems and Tufts University has adopted it as the framework for its digital repository [2]. Some of the features, which make Fedora appealing to us include versioning, policy model, object extensibility, support for rdf, and objects relationship management. \r\rOften times publishing content into a repository involves several stages and complex work flows, therefore requiring a lengthy content creation to publishing cycle. At Tufts, for instance, publishing content to the Tufts Digital library is a multiple-stage process involving coordination between many university groups. This process works reasonably well for archival content which requires rigorous review, but carries too high of an overhead for personal and temporary collections. Also, revising and updating the content is time consuming, which may lead to out-of-synch objects, which have fallen through the cracks. The fedora administrative client, in our opinion, has been designed for users with relatively good understanding of Fedora and is not appropriate for general content contributors, who don’t necessarily possess required technical skills. \r\rTo simplify the workflow of getting objects into repository, applications such as Fez [3] and Elated [4] have been developed.  Fez is a configurable digital repository and workflow management system based on Fedora.  Elated is a general purpose web-based client for Fedora.  While these systems are good for authoring smaller collections, they can become tedious for creating collections with many objects, building relationships, and dynamically updating them.\r\rThe Visual Understanding Environment (VUE) extends the functionality of traditional concept mapping applications by allowing users to attach content to the nodes or concepts in the concept maps [5].Prior to the VUE integration with Fedora, VUE users used to create concept maps in isolation, although the content in these maps may have been related to that in others’ maps. The value of these maps would be much higher if they could be combined with maps created by all users in a shared repository. Thus we identified the need to integrate VUE with Fedora and enable automated publishing of concept maps directly into a Fedora repository. \r\rCurrently, VUE is integrated with many digital repository systems including Fedora and allows users to search, browse and deposit content back into the digital repository systems. In VUE II, the latest version, nodes and links can be associated with ontologies, thus making the maps more meaningful not just for users but also applications that can understand of those ontologies.  By taking advantage of these features in VUE, we have a developed a system to publish objects from a local VUE instance into a Fedora Repository. Objects in a concept map are published along with its metadata and relationship information. \r\rImplementation in VUE\rA concept map in VUE is considered analogous to a network of objects in a repository.  Every concept or object in VUE can be assigned metadata terms using metadata schemes such as Dublin Core or VRA [6]. In addition, users can load additional metadata schemes or create their own vocabularies in order to assign terms to an object. This metadata is stored along with the objects when it is ingested into a repository.  Relationships among objects are defined by Fedora’s Ontology. When a link of fedora ontology type is created it gets deposited in the repository along with the object in the RELS-EXT datastream.  Thus a rich network of objects along with relationships is persisted when the concept map is published to the repository. \r\rSearching Repository\rVUE implements an Open Knowledge Initiative (OKI) based framework to discover objects in digital repositories.   Users may perform simple or advanced search on a specific repository or a set of repositories to retrieve desired content. The results can be dragged in to create nodes and build concept maps. The metadata associated with the digital objects is also pulled into the map and persists with the map.  Once these objects are drawn into VUE, additional metadata can be associated with the objects. \r\rUnique Identifiers for Objects \rA unique identifier (id) is generated for every object published to a Fedora repository through VUE. The id is 32 bytes long and based on date, time and the physical address of the computer. It is of the following format:  vue:a40711e982405ee401a80747f97a3e30. The chances for collision of ids among objects are therefore minimized.\r\rPersistence to Repository\rOnce users create concept maps they can publish them to repository in two modes: Publish Map or Publish All. While Publish Map only publishes the map to repository, Publish All  mode  publishes each object in the map, modifies the map to point to the object in the repository and then publishes the map to the repository. Thus the map with full functionality and all related objects exists in the repository and can be shared with other users.  When the map or a resource in the map is changed and re-published the objects in the repository are assigned a new version. \r\rMetadata\rAssigning appropriate metadata to objects is an essential feature of a system that publishes to repository.  VUE natively supports adding Dublin Core and VRA metadata to nodes and links. Additional metadata schemas can be loaded into VUE by changing its configuration file. Alternatively users can create custom metadata terms or just tag the objects which get transferred to the repository. \r\rOntology for Relationships\rEvery object in a concept map when published to Fedora gets relationship metadata that connects it to the map it belongs to. VUE also supports Fedora relationship ontology terms (RELS-EXT).   Relationships can be created among objects within a concept map and they get persisted in a Fedora Repository thus creating a true network of objects connecting an object to all its relatives. \r \rImplementation/Customization in Fedora\r\rContent Models\rIn order to accommodate the VUE-generated objects within the Fedora framework, we designed three content models – one for VUE maps (tufts/vue/map/generic), one for managed objects (tufts/vue/other), and one for remote objects (tufts/vue/remote). All three models rely on an rdf datastream (RELS-EXT) to define their relationships to each other, one payload data stream (RESOURCE), and Dublin Core metadata (DC). Each object is assigned a unique PID generated in VUE . \r\rSecurity Model\rThe goal of the project was to create a Fedora-based collaborative environment that would allow the VUE user base to contribute and link to a growing content map of resources. It was essential that users be allowed to add their relationships to existing objects created by other users without having privileges to perform any other modification on objects that don’t belong to them. Thus, we designed a set of XACML policies that restrict all API-M Fedora operations to the owner of the object, while allowing modification of the RELS-EXT datastream by all users. We reasoned that a Wikipedia-like collaborative model with some restrictions and versioning would meet our requirements.\r\rIt is worth noting that in order to allow VUE to create objects using Fedora’s upload servlet, we had to allow object creation by all users and also provide access to the upload servlet to any user. VUE creates new objects in one transaction using FOXML after uploading the managed content to Fedora and obtaining the requisite Fedora-assigned URNs for the managed datastream. Once the object is ingested, only the owner has full control over the object.\r\r\rCollection model\rWe represent a VUE map in Fedora as a collection of objects corresponding to the resources within the map. Each object containing a resource encapsulates relationship metadata representing its links to other nodes of the content map. In addition, we ingest one object containing the entire map in the native VUE format. The map object’s relationship metadata points to all the objects representing its nodes. If multiple maps are ingested, which share common objects,  VUE does not create separate resource objects for each content map, but instead reuses the already existing resource object within Fedora and adds relationship data to it so that it also becomes part of the new map.\rIn essence, each content map generated by a VUE user becomes a subset within a super-map containing all user-generated map. This super-map of resources and relations grows organically through each new ingested VUE map, which contains links to existing resources.\r\rVersioning of objects\rFedora provides automatic versioning of the objects within the repository. This, combined with the policy allowing only modifications to the RELS-EXT data stream by non-owners, creates a wiki-like versioned collaborative environment which offers the ability to roll back changes to the objects (for example, after intentional or unintentional vandalism).  \r\rDiscussion \rWe have successfully demonstrated content and collection creation in Fedora through user friendly workflow in VUE.   Users can use VUE to ingest large sets of objects along with metadata. In addition relationships among the objects are captured.  The Fedora community can use this approach to share and collaboratively   build a rich network of digital resources. \r\rReferences\r[1] Payette S. and Lagoze C.: Flexible and Extensible Digital Object Repository Architecture, in  Christos Nikolau and Constantine Stephanidis, eds., Research and Advanced Technologies for Digital Libraries: Proceedings of Second European Conference, ECDL ’98, Heraklion, Crete,Greece, September 21-23, 1998.\r\r[2] Kumar A, Saigal R.,  Chavez R and  Schwertner S.: Architecting an extensible digital repository.

Initially, the bank of images with their associated metadata was handled through ad hoc application software developed at the University of Geneva. The idea was thus to migrate the whole bank of images onto the Fedora system while affecting the least possible user interfaces. To perform such a migration, XSL transformations were applied on metadata to generate MPEG-7 and FOXML files. Beside textual metadata, the MPEG-7 document also contains content descriptors that are extracted using image processing methods. In our case, we applied the Caliph\u0026Emir software, which allows the extraction of 4 descriptors (3 related to colours and one to edge information) out of the 15 defined in the MPEG-7 standard. The resulting XML files were then fed into Fedora, using Generic Search (gSearch) to index metadata into a Lucene based index, the textual part being indexed and the image descriptors just being stored. Indeed, those descriptors are not suited to Lucene indexing, but we found the storing of this piece of information by this search engine to be convenient for performing the image matching step. Besides the MPEG-7 and DC datastreams, the ingest process yielded both low- and high-resolution image datastreams, in addition to an image thumb datastream.\r\rThe second part of the project was about building a user interface for image retrieval. Search process is typically initiated with users performing textual searches on metadata (based on gSearch), which eventually result into lists of images matching textual data. Then, users have the possibility to search for additional images based this time on content similarity. Content similarity involves distance measurements performed on the MPEG-7 descriptors represented as data vectors built from the textual data stored in Lucene. The outcome of this matching process is a set of images URLs, which are included in the result web page so that the user web agent can eventually retrieve them from Fedora. The whole retrieval system has been tested over a corpus of about 900 images representing various scenes and people from the campus. Given that the image corpus is quite heterogeneous, our preliminary results are rather satisfactory in that related visual scenes are similarly ranked.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burgi, Pierre-Yves","Monbaron, Patrick"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8934124,"sim:weight":0.349572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53053,"sim:weight":0.303623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84877,"sim:weight":0.284569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997910,"sim:weight":0.281419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.270769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.261897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930966,"sim:weight":0.259294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.236491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932506,"sim:weight":0.231511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.229895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.225155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151793,"sim:weight":0.221093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.216334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930464,"sim:weight":0.214687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.210959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930624,"sim:weight":0.20775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9633940,"sim:weight":0.204168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931989,"sim:weight":0.200534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930463,"sim:weight":0.200434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930781,"sim:weight":0.198604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While the academic community, commercial journals and libraries have been the stewards over the years of these resources in developed societies, developing countries have lagged behind in the range of institutions that manage their information and knowledge base. Additionally, the knowledge of individuals and local groups in their communities has been largely inaccessible.\r\rWith the current availability of digital camera and audio recorders, as well as the popularity of web sites such as MySpace and Facebook, there is a readiness of individuals to create an share digital content. With the advent of open source digital repositories it is now possible to manage large bodies of digital materials in a structured and affordable way.\r\reJamaica.org is a publicly available digital repository, using DSpace, that provides long-term storage for all types of digital content, with tools to assist users in creating, maintaining, and analyzing their own collections of digital content on Jamaica. It seeks to enhance and accelerate the development of locally authored and freely available digital information collections, for use by schools in support of the governments eLearning initiative, a national spatial data archive, and a facility to encourage partnerships between data gatherers and information users for their mutual benefit.\r\rRepository membership is free, and registered users receive a fixed space home collection for storage of their digital content. Special features include:\r\r1) streaming facilities for multimedia items that convert the relevant bitstreams to a streaming format, and copy them to a streaming server. Access to this version of the item is available via a link on the item page (Figure 2);\r\r2) spatial content facilities which provide a popup map window for repository items that have their  dublin core coverage element (Figure 3);\r\r3) interactive mapping facility for relevant spatial repository content (shape files, etc) that maps them into a web mapping service (WMS). A special “interactive map” type is associated with a text file that indicates the desired repository layers that should be loaded into the web mapping viewer (Figure 4).\r\reJamaica.org is pioneering the field of collaborative content availability in Jamaica, and encourages the sharing of information on Jamaica which is stored in electronic format. It envisions a Jamaica where the citizens have easy access, and the means to share information of cultural, scientific, educational and historical value, the use of which empowers them in all their diversity thought their lives, for this and future generations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Preston, John","Moses, Stacey-Anne"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.376036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10671,"sim:weight":0.338762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.327577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98980,"sim:weight":0.322018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.31649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.315974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151793,"sim:weight":0.31502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.31,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.277375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151792,"sim:weight":0.27387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9322815,"sim:weight":0.266455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184265,"sim:weight":0.260538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26473,"sim:weight":0.259542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.255484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1495139,"sim:weight":0.247029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.238433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.220205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57517,"sim:weight":0.19723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100608,"sim:weight":0.196506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002988,"sim:weight":0.1831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Meanwhile, these same surveys identify the challenge of maintaining a constant stream of contributions from the community as the chronic threat to the health of most active repositories; although each of the mainstream open repository platforms has been designed for self-service ingestion, it is widely acknowledged that the strongest and most up-to-date repositories are those that have professional staff who are responsible for content management, a luxury that few institutions can afford. Even those institutions that have implemented mandatory submission policies, especially in light of publishers\u0027 policies the are increasingly favorable to the principles of open access, still have not been able to achieve high levels of participation. The simple truth is that contribution to an IR today represents extra effort for the busy scholar, effort that doesn\u0027t add real value to their research, their authorship, or their collaboration with others in their field. \r\rWe believe that scholars’ interactions with their local IRs should be more natural and more tightly integrated with their daily research activities. In particular we would like to give researchers stronger incentives to \\\"live\\\" within their DSpace, driven by features that motivate them to spend significant time there, manage their content there, and ultimately to make both the submission of research materials into the IR and the sharing of data and information with colleagues a natural, effortless aspect of their work. Fundamentally, we believe that the scholar’s personal “space” within a DSpace should augment and simplify their research activities, not a valueless canard on their already cluttered work processes. \r\rAs a first step, we believe that the user should have basic — but in this Web2.0 world, expected — capabilities that relate their current activities and interests to other artifacts in their host IR, so at HPLabs we are actively experimenting with features like item bookmarking and personal tagging within local DSpace collections and using the resulting research contexts as a basis for recommending items related to the researcher\u0027s interests. Moving forward, we are exploring how to leverage this capability as a basis for identifying and retrieving related items within the local repository\u0027s federation[3] and especially for identifying colleagues who are discovered to have related interests. Finally, we are investigating ways to apply these basic techniques to the problem of identifying and harvesting related materials from other, heterogeneous sources such as external blogs, wikis, and web sources, and combining them with methods for managing the publication and sharing of research artifacts within the individual\u0027s scholarly network(s).","bibo:AuthorList":["erickson, john","Rutherford, James","Elliott, Desmond"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.42013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.407107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.378855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.375113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151793,"sim:weight":0.362754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.360674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.35908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.355754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4151792,"sim:weight":0.355043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.353517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.349009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.341789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732129,"sim:weight":0.341466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930781,"sim:weight":0.338276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.334145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000309,"sim:weight":0.329392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.326998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.303236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271203,"sim:weight":0.294169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002988,"sim:weight":0.20145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A digital video portal for the state of New Jersey must support the complex educational needs of K20 schools as well as  the diversity of information and cultural heritage institutions of which there are over 600 including public libraries, archives, historical societies,  and museums.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jantz, Ronald C.","Agnew, Grace","Beard, Isaiah"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8932506,"sim:weight":0.371709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933614,"sim:weight":0.259809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930624,"sim:weight":0.224215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15592,"sim:weight":0.220881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27910,"sim:weight":0.218792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732171,"sim:weight":0.21355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15620,"sim:weight":0.21116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930966,"sim:weight":0.203127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4184265,"sim:weight":0.201135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186344,"sim:weight":0.197853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934640,"sim:weight":0.181038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9322815,"sim:weight":0.17667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15616,"sim:weight":0.176001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2795073,"sim:weight":0.175385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998042,"sim:weight":0.155185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":268168,"sim:weight":0.152563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100608,"sim:weight":0.151566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185817,"sim:weight":0.150151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930696,"sim:weight":0.14721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70186,"sim:weight":0.146519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
