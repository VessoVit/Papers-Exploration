The group then met five times over six months and preferences were elicited independently on 41 scenarios. After individual valuation, the group discussed the scenarios, following which preferences could be changed. Changes made were described and summary measures (mean and median) before and after discussion compared using paired t test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. Semi-structured telephone interviews were carried out to explore attitudes to discussing preferences. These were transcribed, read by two investigators and emergent themes described.\n\t\t\tResults: \n\t\t\tSixteen changes (3.6%) were made to preferences by seven (47%) of the fifteen members. The difference between individual preference values before and after discussion ranged from -0.025 to 0.45. The average effect on the group mean was 0.0053. No differences before and after discussion were statistically significant. The group valued discussion highly and suggested it brought four main benefits: reassurance; improved procedural performance; increased group cohesion; satisfying curiosity.\n\t\t\tConclusion: \n\t\t\tThe hypothesis that preferences are incomplete cannot be rejected for a proportion of respondents. However, brief discussion did not result in substantial number of changes to preferences and these did not have significant impact on summary values for the group, suggesting that incompleteness, if present, may not have an important effect on cost-utility analyses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stein, Ken","Ratcliffe, Julie","Round, Ali","Milne, Ruairidh","Brazier, John E"],"dc:date":"2006-03-29","doi":"10.1186/1477-7525-4-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108284,"sim:weight":0.20765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.20575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108251,"sim:weight":0.204148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108747,"sim:weight":0.177804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266223,"sim:weight":0.161689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50123,"sim:weight":0.138242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9750,"sim:weight":0.131994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this study was to investigate agreement on dimensions of a checklist between two referees when evaluating abstracts submitted for a primary care conference.\n\t\t\tMethods\n\t\t\tAnonymised abstracts were scored using a structured assessment comprising seven categories. Between one (poor) and four (excellent) marks were awarded for each category, giving a maximum possible score of 28 marks.

Mean total scores of abstracts accepted and rejected for the meeting were compared using an unpaired t test.\n\t\t\tResults\n\t\t\tOf 52 abstracts, agreement between reviewers was greater for three components relating to study design (adjusted intraclass correlation coefficients 0.40 to 0.45) compared to four components relating to more subjective elements such as the importance of the study and likelihood of provoking discussion (0.01 to 0.25).

Histologically, all the tumours were composed of small ducts with a double cell lining surrounded by a basement membrane. The inner cells were epithelial and the outer cells myoepithelial, the latter usually possessing clear cytoplasm. There was a variable degree of intervening hyalinised stroma. All the tumours were partly encapsulated, but also displayed local invasiveness. One of the tumours also showed areas of dedifferentiation when it later recurred and metastasised. The other three were apparently cured by initial excision, with adjuvant radiotherapy in one instance. In the past this tumour has been described as clear cell adenoma, and it was only recently that its true malignant nature, albeit low grade, was recognised. Reports of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma are still relatively few, with only one case described from Britain. It is recommended that this histologically distinct neoplasm deserves wider recognition.","bibo:AuthorList":["Simpson, R H","Clarke, T J","Sarsfield, P T","Gluckman, P G"],"dc:date":"1991-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5848822,"sim:weight":0.255922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929888,"sim:weight":0.109937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A dominant-negative frameshift mutation in the IPF-l gene was identified in a single family and shown to cause pancreatic agenesis when homozygous and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) when heterozygous. We studied the role of IPF-1 in Caucasian diabetic and nondiabetic subjects from the United Kingdom. Three novel IPF-1 missense mutations (C18R, D76N, and R197H) were identified in patients with type 2 diabetes. Functional analyses of these mutations demonstrated decreased binding activity to the human insulin gene promoter and reduced activation of the insulin gene in response to hyperglycemia in the human beta-cell line Nes2y. These mutations are present in 1% of the population and predisposed the subject to type 2 diabetes with a relative risk of 3.0. They were not highly penetrant MODY mutations, as there were nondiabetic mutation carriers 25-53 years of age. We conclude that mutations in the IPF-1 gene may predispose to type 2 diabetes and are a rare cause of MODY and pancreatic agenesis, with the phenotype depending upon the severity of the mutation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Macfarlane, Wendy M.","Frayling, Timothy M.","Ellard, Sian","Evans, Julie C.","Allen, Lisa I.

We recorded article characteristics, including information about authors\u0027 financial disclosures. The main outcome measures were the prevalence, nature, and consistency of financial disclosures. There were 746 articles, 2985 authors, and 135 journals in the database. Eighty-three percent of the articles did not contain disclosure statements for any author (including declarations of no interests). Only 6% of authors had an article with a disclosure statement. In comparisons between articles by the same author, the types of disagreement were as follows: no disclosure statements vs declarations of no interests (64%); specific disclosures vs no disclosure statements (34%); and specific disclosures vs declarations of no interests (2%).

PCR products were analysed using both LIS-SSCP electrophoresis and an ABI 377 DNA sequencer using Genescan software. A Jurkat T cell leukaemia cell line was used to determine the sensitivity of the two methods.\n\nRESULTS: Clonal TCR gamma populations were detected in all 11 samples from patients with a T cell disease and no clonal populations were detected in samples from patients without a T cell disorder, using both LIS-SSCP and DNA sequencer analysis. Although the sensitivity of the two methods was comparable, the data generated by the sequencer were easier to interpret than the LIS-SSCP gels, and allowed accurate size determination of every product, which was not possible using LIS-SSCP.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of fluorescent labelled nucleotides provides a more flexible and economical alternative to end labelled fluorescent primers for the detection of clonal TCR gamma gene rearrangements. This method allows clonal populations to be sized accurately and reproducibly, permitting the detection of identical clonal populations in different samples, and providing a method of monitoring disease progression and response to treatment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wickham, C L","Lynas, C","Ellard, S"],"dc:date":"2000-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":25886,"sim:weight":0.154444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23870,"sim:weight":0.133742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.123609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.119797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25913,"sim:weight":0.11621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23818,"sim:weight":0.105311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.0874845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

With a 20E concentration of 50 nM, cucurbitacins B and D give 50% responses at 1.5 and 10 microM respectively. Both cucurbitacins are able to displace specifically bound radiolabelled 25-deoxy-20-hydroxyecdysone (ponasterone A) from a cell-free preparation of the BII cells containing ecdysteroid receptors. The Kd values for cucurbitacins B and D (5 and 50 microM respectively) are similar to the concentrations required to antagonize 20E activity with whole cells. Cucurbitacin B (cucB) prevents stimulation by 20E of an ecdysteroid-responsive reporter gene in a transfection assay. CucB also prevents the formation of the Drosophila ecdysteroid receptor/Ultraspiracle/20E complex with the hsp27 ecdysteroid response element as demonstrated by gel-shift assay. This is therefore the first definitive evidence for the existence of antagonists acting at the ecdysteroid receptor. Preliminary structure/activity studies indicate the importance of the Delta23-22-oxo functional grouping in the side chain for antagonistic activity. Hexanorcucurbitacin D, which lacks carbon atoms C-22 to C-27, is found to be a weak agonist rather than an antagonist. Moreover, the side chain analogue 5-methylhex-3-en-2-one possesses weak antagonistic activity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dinan, L","Whiting, P","Girault, J P","Lafont, R","Dhadialla, T S","Cress, D E","Mugat, B","Antoniewski, C","Lepesant, J A"],"dc:date":"1997-11-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.154812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23039,"sim:weight":0.115373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.0974055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

DESIGN: Cross sectional survey. SETTING: One general practice of eight doctors in Bristol. SUBJECTS: 305 general practice attenders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The rate of detection by general practitioners of cases of depression and anxiety as defined by the general health questionnaire. RESULTS: Consecutive attenders completed the general health questionnaire and the symptom interpretation questionnaire, which scores style of symptom attribution along the dimensions of psychologising, somatising, and normalising. General practitioners detected depression or anxiety in 56 (36%; 95% confidence interval 28% to 44%) of the 157 patients who scored highly on the general health questionnaire. Subjects with a normalising attributional style were less likely to be detected as cases; doctors did not make any psychological diagnosis in 46 (85%; 73% to 93%) of 54 patients who had high questionnaire and high normalising scores. Those with a psychologising style were more likely to be detected; doctors did not detect 21 (38%; 25% to 52%) of 55 patients who had high questionnaire and high psychologising scores. The somatisation scale was not associated with low detection rates. This pattern of results persisted after adjustment for age, sex, general health questionnaire score, and general practitioner. CONCLUSIONS: Normalising attributions minimise symptoms and are non-pathological in character. The normalising attributional style is predominant in general practice attenders and is an important cause of low rates of detection of depression and anxiety.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kessler, David","Lloyd, Keith","Lewis, Glyn","Gray, Dennis Pereira"],"dc:date":"1999-02-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1448025,"sim:weight":0.218342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.214586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2753332,"sim:weight":0.172359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26828,"sim:weight":0.165139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55967,"sim:weight":0.142449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24364,"sim:weight":0.137319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In contrast, Montaigne, in \u0027L\u0027Apologie de Raimond Sebond\u0027, seriously considers the Cynic challenge to normative values, and suggests that Cynicism\u0027s commitment to nature shows that the normal definitions of vice and virtue should be inverted, in a daring example of paradiastole.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roberts, Hugh"],"dc:date":"2004-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.132189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108542,"sim:weight":0.122886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108355,"sim:weight":0.120476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108780,"sim:weight":0.119259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108669,"sim:weight":0.109921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85200,"sim:weight":0.104976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108327,"sim:weight":0.0893564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108774,"sim:weight":0.0837196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The research examines if the introduction of full-time study requirements at universities for aspiring accountants effectively introduced a closure mechanism in the accounting profession. Data was derived from an Oral History study of partners in large firms. The younger partners (born after the Second World War) completed full-time degree study at university, but did not provide evidence of class mobility into the profession. The older cohort, born between 1928 and 1946, completed part-time studies only, few completed a degree, and, in contrast to the younger cohort, shows a perceptible upward movement from lower socio-economic classes into the professional class. This suggests that changing the preferred educational routes for new accountants entering the large chartered accounting (CA) firms compromised the \"stepping stone\" function of accounting as a portal into the professional class.","bibo:AuthorList":["Baskerville, Rachel F."],"dc:date":"2006-09","doi":"10.1177/1032373206065864","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108270,"sim:weight":0.271767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55995,"sim:weight":0.245337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57174,"sim:weight":0.244224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929827,"sim:weight":0.152685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51515,"sim:weight":0.142535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108645,"sim:weight":0.125059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We start by confirming the apparent existence of a Big Firm premium during the period 1985-2002. We examine industry specialisation, non audit service fee and monopoly pricing explanations for the premium. The results of our tests of industry specialisation are mixed. There is little evidence that this premium is associated with industry specialisation when specialists are defined at the national level. Significant premium are observed if specialisation is defined at the city level, particularly if the auditor is the industry leader. However, when appropriate allowance is made for endogeneity, by modelling both audit and non-audit fees in a simultaneous equations framework, the Big Firm premium disappears. We find evidence to suggest that non audit fees earned by auditors from their audit clients are positively related to the size of the audit size and vice versa. Finally, when the sample is stratified by the size of audit client, we find no systematic evidence of anti-competitive pricing.","bibo:AuthorList":["McMeeking, Kevin P.","Pope, Peter F.","Peasnell, Ken V."],"dc:date":"2006-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":81006,"sim:weight":0.542742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108567,"sim:weight":0.532682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393847,"sim:weight":0.467442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85650,"sim:weight":0.348304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930474,"sim:weight":0.310931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1555609,"sim:weight":0.309025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109146,"sim:weight":0.246114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.207859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108914,"sim:weight":0.164868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108423,"sim:weight":0.158863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57283,"sim:weight":0.15079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108782,"sim:weight":0.13893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734394,"sim:weight":0.114284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":2734592,"ep:Repository":45,"dc:type":["Working Paper"],"bibo:shortTitle":"“Small GAAP: a large jump for the IASB”","bibo:abstract":"In the last fifteen years, many national standard setters have introduced differential\nreporting for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Internationally, SMEs are a diverse\nand dynamic group which are described under broad characteristics in different countries.\nSMEs are not issuers or public sector entities and therefore frequently the qualitative\ncriteria of not being publicly accountable may define these entities. Acceptance and\nimposition of International Accounting Standards (IASs) has reignited the debate on\ndifferential reporting, especially since the International Accounting Standards Board\n(IASB) issued a discussion document in June 2004 on SME reporting.\nIt is apparent the majority of national standard setters support an IASB-generated\nalternative reporting regime for SMEs, citing that IFRS developed specifically for listed\nentities are not relevant for SMEs. Benefits would include lower compliance costs for\nreporters who would face reduced disclosure due to simplified presentation. This would\nencourage continuing compliance to the IAS regime thus benefiting users when SMEs\nproduce comparable financial information.\nIt is the objective of this paper to provide a review of the diversity in jurisdictional\napproaches to resolve these issues. This includes a discussion of the two approaches: the\n‘top-down’ or the ‘bottom-up’ approach, with examples of each. This research has been\nmotivated by the absence in academic literature of sufficient studies examining the\nunderlying issues fundamental to redefining the balance between the accountability and\ndecision-usefulness functions of general purpose financial reporting. To achieve this\nobjective, this paper considers relevant academic and practitioner literature before\nundertaking an analysis of the issues this literature raises. Unique SME factors, including\nclose-knit agency relationships, and a tendency to aim for survival and stability over profit\nmaximisation and growth suggest a distinctly different focus to the IASB conceptual\nframework is required.\nThe prevalence of an unsubstantiated view that SMEs are ‘small entities on the way to\nbecoming large entities’ overshadows the argument on whether and how SMEs should be\noffered relief from highly technical IAS. Some countries have regulation for SMEs already\nor are developing a Best Practice Guide for their SMEs. Exemptions may be based on a\npublic accountability test (as in Canada), but Finland finds the Canadian example ‘too\nvague’ and New Zealand’s sector-neutral stance made the application of this definition too\nbroad.\nThe IASB may limit definition to broad qualitative and quantitative SME boundaries in its\nstruggle to provide a useful suite of SME accounting standards to nation states. Managing\ndifferent worldviews and the demands of both preparers and users who are unused to\nlobbying at a high level, will be challenging for the IASB. Although the IASB originally\naimed for a single set of conceptually robust SME standards, they must revisit the specific\nstewardship focus of SME reporting to gain traction in this project. The SME debate\nappears as a crucible in which the resolution of such tensions may in time be resolved.","bibo:AuthorList":["Baskerville, Rachel F.","Cordery, Carolyn J."],"dc:date":"2006-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Our results use unique data about the profit-sharing arrangements of the Big 8 firms during the period 1985 to 1994. We investigate whether there is a correlation between profit-sharing and risky clients. Firms consist of the financially integrated firms, i.e., those that share their profits across a large pool of partners across the country and the financially independent firms that share their profits in a small pool on a local office basis. The large-pool firms provide more incentive for partners to cooperate to audit high-risk clients than the small-pool firms. Our results show that the large-pool firms are associated with riskier client portfolios; this is indicated by a higher proportion of fees from clients that later suffer from bankruptcies. In contrast, a smaller proportion of the clients of the small-pool firms go bankrupt. Tests using financial distress as alternative measures of client risk confirm this result.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hay, David C.","Baskerville, Rachel F.","Qiu, Travis Hui"],"dc:date":"2007-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108586,"sim:weight":0.376415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81006,"sim:weight":0.288179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15237,"sim:weight":0.274794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108567,"sim:weight":0.259517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85650,"sim:weight":0.216943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108940,"sim:weight":0.194258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.186334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85519,"sim:weight":0.185075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108491,"sim:weight":0.16581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734394,"sim:weight":0.160082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930474,"sim:weight":0.159176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Many of the interviewees in\n2002 recalled anti-nepotism clauses in accounting partnership deeds and acknowledged these\nclauses had been triggered by an event. There was a diversity of recollection as to the detail of\nthis event, and various rationales, justifications, or explanations were provided.

{"identifier":2734610,"ep:Repository":45,"dc:type":["Working Paper"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Paying the price of the failure to retain legitimacy in a national charity: the CORSO story","bibo:abstract":"The Council for the Organisation of Relief Services Overseas (CORSO), established\nin 1944, was dedicated to the relief of poverty overseas. It was a New Zealand\norganisation which acted to co-ordinate the activities of different national bodies; all\nof whom shared a vision of working towards such relief of the poverty. CORSO’s\nprimary vision for such relief being organised “under one umbrella” attracted 50\nmember organisations by 1967. Legitimacy theory provides an undemanding\ntheoretical frame for early CORSO. It also explains the period of crisis in relation to\nreduced legitimacy when, in the 1960s, CORSO began to focus increasingly on\ndevelopment to build foundations for impoverished peoples overseas to gain greater\nself-reliance. This change in strategic direction was insufficiently communicated to\nthe general public, though it was generally accepted within the organisation.\nFrom the 1970s the increased politicisation of society impacted on CORSO’s\nmembership, and Maori radicals became prominent in CORSO along with ‘leftist’\nindividuals and groups. The early strong coalition was progressively replaced with\ndivisiveness from the mid-1970s amid growing public mistrust of CORSO; as it\nchanged from an apolitical body to one increasingly focused on issues from an anticapitalist\nstance. Polarisation and the subsequent consequences are similar to other\nnot-for-profit coalitions.\nDeterioration in budgeting was concomitant with CORSO’s declining Appeal\nproceeds. Without suggesting a central role for accounting in CORSO’s decline, the\ncorrelation of robust or deficient accounting processes respectively with economic\ngood and poor health appears positive. Until the late 1960s, evidence indicates a\nrobust accounting process which subsequently deteriorated, from the 1975 Treasurer’s\nReport onwards. In examining CORSO’s decline from 1970, until its ‘functional\ndeath’ in 1991, the causes of this decline provide a valuable illustration of the\nimportance of political independence and integrity for charitable organisations’\nsurvival.\nThe data for this study is derived from primary and secondary sources including\nnewspaper articles, annual reports, correspondence and opinion surveys. This research\nalso analyses accounting data, evidencing a correlation of robust or deficient\naccounting processes respectively with economic excellent or poor health. To this\nextent the accounting data provides a ‘bio-marker’ of organisational health.\nKey to CORSO’s demise was a change in strategic direction brokered by governing\nmembers which resulted in a philosophical shift unsupported by many of its core\northodox member bodies, with ‘fatal’ consequences. CORSO from 1990 was not a\nbroad-based coalition, but survives as a persistent, yet impaired, brand name\nemployed by a small coalition of socialists and Maori radicals. CORSO failed to erect\nbarriers to capture, or to recognise it. This historic perspective on the demise of such a\ngiant in New Zealand charities provides a clear illustration of a failure to sense and\nadapt sufficiently to its dynamic political landscape, and illustrates how the not-forprofit\nsector is more dependant than other sectors on continuing legitimisation\nprocesses in its implicit contract with the society to which it offers its vision.","bibo:AuthorList":["Baskerville, Rachel F.","Sutton, David","Cordery, Carolyn J."],"dc:date":"2007-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.195377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56356,"sim:weight":0.190562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.161762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In these procedures, ARFIMA models are fitted to the data, and the estimates used to simulate the null hypothesis of non-cointegration in a vector autoregressive modelling framework. The simulations are used to estimate p-values for alternative regression-based test statistics, including the F goodness-of-fit statistic, the Durbin–Watson statistic and estimates of the residual d. The bootstrap distributions are economical to compute, being conditioned on the actual sample values of all but the dependent variable in the regression. The procedures are easily adapted to test stronger null hypotheses, such as statistical independence. The tests are not in general asymptotically pivotal, but implemented by the bootstrap, are shown to be consistent against alternatives with both stationary and nonstationary cointegrating residuals. As an example, the tests are applied to the series for UK consumption and disposable income. The power properties of the tests are studied by simulations of artificial cointegrating relationships based on the sample data.

We find that depending upon his information, set of signals, and commitment power, he may strategically transmit messages to buyers in order to increase his revenue. In an environment where the seller knows the rankings and lacks any commitment power, we find that the seller is unable to exploit his information. However, in an environment where the seller knows the realized valuations and can credibly announce either the true rankings or the true values (or announce nothing at all) but cannot commit as to which of these truthful messages to announce, then it is indeed possible to increase his revenue. If the seller, in addition, can commit to the full signaling strategy, then his expected revenue will be even higher.

In our proposed formulation, this question corresponds to two important questions previously asked: Does a first-price auction have higher revenue than a second-price auction when buyers have asymmetric distributions (asked by Maskin and Riley [2000])? And does a seller enhance revenue by releasing information (asked by Milgrom and Weber[1982])? This is shown by constructing two Harsanyi games of incomplete information each having the same ex-ante distribution of valuations but in one beliefs are symmetric while in the other beliefs are sometimes asymmetric. Our main result is that answers to all three questions coincide when values are independent and are related when values are affiliated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kaplan, Todd R.","Zamir, Shmuel"],"dc:date":"2002-02","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.300401","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931961,"sim:weight":0.299251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.275498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We derive firms\u0027 decisions from utility maximization by individuals. This reduces the usual monopoly distortion. We find that corporate governance can effect the equilibrium in the product (or input) markets. This enables us to endogenize the objective function of the firm. If the firm cannot commit not to change its constitution, we find a Coaselike result where all market power is lost in the limit. We present a more abstract model of governance in the presence of market distortions and discuss its implications for the governance of universities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kelsey, David","Milne, Frank"],"dc:date":"2005-02","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.704821","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We introduce a class of two-player games that permits two distinct ways to cooperate in the repeated game. One way to cooperate is to play cutoff strategies, which rely solely on a player\u0027s private value to defection. The second cooperative strategy is to take turns, which relies on publicly available information. Our initial experiments reveal that almost all cooperators adopt cutoff strategies. However, follow-up experiments in which the distribution of values to defection are made more similar show that all cooperators now take turns. Our results offer insight into what form a cooperative norm will take: for mundane tasks or where individuals otherwise have similar payoffs, taking turns is likely; for difficult tasks that differentiate individuals by skill or by preferences, cutoff cooperation will emerge.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kaplan, Todd R.","Ruffle, Bradley J."],"dc:date":"2007-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8930875,"sim:weight":0.194909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929825,"sim:weight":0.156123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":112395,"sim:weight":0.148502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In contrast to existing economic models, gifts in our model are given only when they enhance expected welfare. In fact, the welfare improvement from gift giving is strictly higher than that from any possible equilibrium and gift giving survives the introduction of nearby specialty stores that have access to the same gift goods. We use our model to explain a number of stylized facts about gift giving in modern and foraging societies, the organization of retail trade and in-kind government transfers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ruffle, Bradley J.","Kaplan, Todd R."],"dc:date":"2001-01","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.257616","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26012,"sim:weight":0.195173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26013,"sim:weight":0.195173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671481,"sim:weight":0.18715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108139,"sim:weight":0.166105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671209,"sim:weight":0.156407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108332,"sim:weight":0.147403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108900,"sim:weight":0.143378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The auction designs that maximize the social surplus or the seller\u0027s pay-off are analysed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kaplan, Todd R.","Sela, Aner"],"dc:date":"2003-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931961,"sim:weight":0.444275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932245,"sim:weight":0.300724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.253176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These processes exhibit short memory fluctuations around a local mean (regime) which switches randomly such that the durations of the regimes follow a power law. We show that if a large number of independent copies of such a process are aggregated, the resulting processes are Gaussian, have a linear representation, and converge after normalisation to fractional Brownian motion. Alternatively, an aggregation scheme with Gaussian common components can yield the same result. However, a non-aggregated regime process is shown to converge to a Levy motion with infinite variance, suitably normalised, emphasising the fact that time aggregation alone fails to yield a FCLT. Two cases arise, a stationary case in which the partial sums of the process converge, and a nonstationary case in which the process itself converges, the Hurst coefficient falling in the ranges () and (), respectively. We comment on the relevance of our results to the interpretation of the long memory phenomenon, and also report some simulations aimed to throw light on the problem of discriminating between the models in practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davidson, James","Sibbertsen, Philipp"],"dc:date":"2005-10","doi":"10.1016/j.jeconom.2004.08.014","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":69859,"sim:weight":0.212878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998720,"sim:weight":0.206906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":675750,"sim:weight":0.205674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85026,"sim:weight":0.19444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":666446,"sim:weight":0.182395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26251,"sim:weight":0.180897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998721,"sim:weight":0.166989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108624,"sim:weight":0.162774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Accordingly, governments have taken measures to support the development and efficient functioning of national venture capital markets. As a policy response, particularly in the more problematic early-stage investment area, many countries have set up government financed support programs to channel risk capital to new ventures through private VC funds. The choice of the incentive structure for a publicly co-financed and privately managed venture capital fund is crucial for the success of a program. However, there is very little robust research determining the actual effects of different structures on fund performance. A comparison of government VC structures has been hindered by both the variety of utilized structures and the plurality of domestic environments. In this study, we examine the effects of different incentive structures on the performance of publicly co-financed venture capital programs under changing market conditions by comparing these structures in a simulation model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jääskeläinen, Mikko","Maula, Markku","Murray, Gordon"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85341,"sim:weight":0.283552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.192099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108025,"sim:weight":0.161731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This may pose a difficult problem when agents receiving those goods have private information in regards to their values or needs or discriminating among agents is not an option. In this paper, we search for an optimal mechanism to allocate goods when the designer is benevolent. While the designer cannot charge agents, he can receive a costly but wasteful signal from them. We show that for a large class of distributions of valuations, ignoring these costly signals by giving agents equal share (or using lotteries if the goods are indivisible) maximizes the social surplus. In other cases, those that send the highest signal should receive the goods; however, we then show that there exist cases where more complicated mechanisms are superior.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chakravarty, Surajeet","Kaplan, Todd R."],"dc:date":"2009-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8826882,"sim:weight":0.262503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1394794,"sim:weight":0.225453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26006,"sim:weight":0.222881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932274,"sim:weight":0.204395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Both dyadic interactions involving a buyer and a seller, and triadic interactions involving a buyer and two suppliers, are examined to gain a more precise understanding of how small number interactions might influence transaction cost.  We show that transaction cost is maximized when a buyer follows a single source strategy and learning specificity is present. Only if a buyer follows a multiple source strategy that splits the supply contract  in such a way as to equalize the effects of learning specificity across the suppliers, will transaction cost be maximized and will a buyer be able to appropriate the efficiency gains achieved by its suppliers. Production and transaction costs interact to influence governance decisions. The equilibrium is such that a single (multiple)  source strategy is optimal when efficiency gains due to the economies of scale are large (small), but those due to learning specificity are small (large). When both the effects of economies of scale and learning specificity are large, internalization is the optimal strategy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee, Khai S.","Ng, Irene C.

These will only be met if process industries are able to integrate disparate production-related functions to accommodate new technology. This paper investigates how production competence enhances technology-based competitive advantage in process industries. A survey of the literature and a preliminary study of 20 process firms raised a series of questions that were investigated further using two case studies. The analysis demonstrates that competitive advantage requires integration between operations, technology and asset management through matching production requirements with the inherent capability of equipment and an understanding of equipment of functionality. Production competence is acquired through a learning mindset, which relies on an investigation of critical unknowns. Competitive advantage derives from tacit knowledge, and complex interdependencies between novel technology and organisational elements, and is enhanced by informal exploration and testing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hipkin, Ian"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This assertion has only been subject to minimal empirical research: typically restricted to small-sample qualitative studies or to examining the respective influences of independent VC firms and CV units on the performance of portfolio firms (Gompers \u0026 Lerner, 1998; Maula \u0026 Murray, 2001).\n\nA longitudinal survey of 95 CV units across three continents found mixed empirical support for the suggestion. Of the VC structures and practices investigated, strongest support was found for CV unit engagement with the VC community which was consistently associated with superior corporate venturing performance along both strategic and financial dimensions. VC-like equity-based compensation systems were not found to influence CV performance even where CV units were strongly focused on financial goals. Overall, the adoption of VC practices, partially mediated by venture unit performance, was positively associated with CV unit survival. These results suggest that selective adoption of elements of the VC model may enhance CV unit performance and survival.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hill, Susan A.","Birkinshaw, Julian","Murray, Gordon"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85341,"sim:weight":0.430787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.19093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109137,"sim:weight":0.177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.176489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734394,"sim:weight":0.135077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340559,"sim:weight":0.134809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85702,"sim:weight":0.126901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108823,"sim:weight":0.121242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The current paper reports the outcomes of a two-phase investigation into leadership development in SMEs in the South West of England which attempted to address this issue by devising an educational and support programme matched specifically to the requirements of SME leaders. \nPhase One aimed to establish the demand for leadership development in SMEs in the Region by identifying the current challenges facing such organisations. Data was collected by means of face-to-face interviews with 20 SME leaders and was supported by interviews with leadership experts/practitioners. The research identified four principle areas of concern: strategic, human resource, leadership, and other (location, legislation, support and advice, etc.), which were explored further at a half-day forum to determine how this could be used to develop an educational programme. \n\nPhase Two used the outcomes of this research to develop a leadership development programme for SME leaders. This comprised a number of different elements to be compared and contrasted, including: facilitated workshops, formal topic sessions, a short course, company consultancies, and an Internet forum. As in Phase One, the programme finished with a discussion forum to explore the outcomes and next steps. \n\nEvaluation of the programme revealed a demand for leadership development amongst SME leaders in the Region, but that this is primarily for practical input and peer discussion in a flexible, informal environment. A number of lessons were identified and presented as recommendations for future leadership and management development initiatives, including: session content, timing, recruitment and marketing, networking, funding, delivery, and use of Internet/email. \n\nThe paper will conclude with a brief overview of how this research has contributed towards the establishment of further leadership development initiatives in the Region.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bolden, Richard"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is very robust, well understood and mathematically elegant. In the isotropic case elastic properties are obviously easily represented. However, for nonisotropic materials, even in the simple cubic symmetry, it can be difficult to visualise how, for instance, the Young’s modulus or Poisson’s ration vary with stress/strains orientation. The ElAM code carries out the required tensorial operations (inversion, rotation, diagonalisation) and creates 3D models of an elastic property’s anisotropy. It can also produces 2D cuts in any given plane, compute averages following diverse schemes and query a database of elastic constants.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marmier, Arnaud"],"dc:date":"2009-08-19T13:46:40Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Prolog.

Border Pedagogy at Work","bibo:abstract":"Linda McDowell (1994) has recently called for styles of teaching which put into practice arguments about the \u0027politics of difference\u0027 which are becoming an increasingly common part of geographical research. This paper discusses a case study in which these politics have been applied to structure an undergraduate option course entitled \u0027Histories \u0026 cultures of the\nTransatlantic\u0027. Here, week by week, students have been required to write a journal charting their own journey through the lectures, reading materials and discussons to make a sense of these materials as they are relevant to their own experiences, fascinations and concerns. In the \u0027border\u0027 pedagogical literature which supports such an approach, it is argued that encouraging\nstudents to write their way into such courses is \u0027empowering\u0027 for them. This paper thus draws on my experiences of orchestrating this course and how this \u0027empowerment\u0027 seems to have worked. For those teachers thinking about adopting such practices themselves. I argue that this\ncan productively be thought of not as an \u0027empowerment\u0027 of students en masse, but as a means to transform existing power relations in the classroom to make them more equitable. Moreover, I argue that journal writing can not be seen simply as a teaching \u0027technique\u0027 which can be applied\nin the same way under all circumstances. Border pedagogy, journal writing and student\nempowerment are discussed, here, as processes which evolve within specific institutional contexts, a point which must be understood when thinking about their introduction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cook, Ian"],"dc:date":"1996-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.334233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.330368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.306455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.29572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27452,"sim:weight":0.278578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.26712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109170,"sim:weight":0.265296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.225099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

New Labour in historical perspective","bibo:abstract":"Historians, commentators and political scientists have divided over whether New Labour marks a definitive break with the pre-1994 Labour Party, or instead represents ‘traditional values in a modern setting’. Steven Fielding has recently offered a systematic and apparently persuasive exposition of the latter argument. In his view, the Labour Party, under Tony Blair’s leadership, has been faithful to its past. This article challenges this interpretation of Labour’s history, and by extension Blair’s own ‘core values’ argument, to which (it is argued here) Fielding’s claims bear a marked resemblance. It is suggested that such interpretations create the risk of a Whig interpretation of the party’s history. Moreover, not only are some of the specific historical judgements used to back them up open to doubt, but also Fielding’s focus on the party’s parliamentary leadership inevitably brings about a misleading conclusion. Blair’s accession marked a shift in the balance of forces within the party, and a focus on the ideology of the leadership alone is bound to obscure this. The article will therefore conclude by exploring the merits of Tony Benn’s remark that New Labour is ‘almost certainly the smallest party in the history of British politics’. It is argued that ‘New Labour’ should be seen not as something that has superseded ‘Old Labour’, but as something that exists alongside it, providing leadership as part of a wider coalition.","bibo:AuthorList":["Toye, Richard"],"dc:date":"2004-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is suggested that the party’s opposition to the National Government’s borrowing for rearmament was strongly influenced by continuing bitterness over the political crisis of 1931; and that focussing criticism on the economic aspects of the rearmament programme helped Labour to mask its divisions over the validity of rearmament itself. Labour politicians’ varying reactions to John Maynard Keynes’s arguments in favour of defence borrowing are explored; as is the party’s attitude to, and impact upon, Neville Chamberlain’s 1937 proposals for a ‘National Defence Contribution’. Moreover, it is argued that, as the political situation in Europe deteriorated, Labour’s policies were influenced further in the direction of central planning and ‘conscription of wealth’, as an alternative to borrowing, which was alleged to be inflationary. Finally, it is suggested the party’s attitude to these questions is illustrative of the way in which economic ideas in the public sphere are inevitably conditioned by the political interests of the politicians who promote them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Toye, Richard"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60866,"sim:weight":0.302365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.252845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60707,"sim:weight":0.248677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58411,"sim:weight":0.240066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84845,"sim:weight":0.23112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65915,"sim:weight":0.220787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52137,"sim:weight":0.209455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58478,"sim:weight":0.20576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108960,"sim:weight":0.20175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60145,"sim:weight":0.190729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86214,"sim:weight":0.189908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56356,"sim:weight":0.187366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929879,"sim:weight":0.173415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50137,"sim:weight":0.158381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For a while, it seemed that this strategy would carry all before it. Emerging from the First World War with a \"socialist\" commitment, it became the largest opposition party at the 1918 general election. In 1922 it became the clear opposition to the Conservatives, and Ramsay MacDonald was reelected leader after an eight-year break. A short-lived minority Labour government in 1924 was followed by heavy electoral defeat, but the party was able to form its second minority government in 1929.

For some, there was no relationship at all; for others there was a relationship but they did not agree on what it looked like.  Many physicists converged with spiritualists, theosophists and others in interpreting X-rays, the electrical theory of matter, and other aspects of the ‘new’ physics as powerful ways of rendering psychic and occult effects scientifically more understandable.  However, they were opposed by commentators on physics who agreed that there was a relationship between the ‘new’ physics and psychical research but that these were two manifestations of a worrying drift of physics into metaphysics and religion.  More redoubtable critics were the psychologists who denied that physicists had the experience or experimental skill to cope reliably with the psycho-physical phenomena encountered in psychical research.  This paper shows that physicist-psychical researchers were content to ally the ‘new’ physics with religion because it helped vanquish awkward associations with materialism.  They also tried to justify the value of their experimental skills by appealing to their expertise in investigating subtle physical effects and ability to create tests that respected the delicate conditions of seances.","bibo:AuthorList":["Noakes, Richard"],"dc:date":"2008-09","doi":"10.1016/j.shpsa.2008.06.004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":87043,"sim:weight":0.240161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.208201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108868,"sim:weight":0.207977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.197128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85453,"sim:weight":0.192134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176792,"sim:weight":0.187407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931406,"sim:weight":0.183105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.176572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108747,"sim:weight":0.172018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is suggested instead that Labour\u0027s sometimes seemingly paradoxical behaviour in office was driven, not only by the very tough economic conditions it faced, but also by a fundamental contradiction inherent in its desire to ‘plan’ at both domestic and international levels. This contradiction – the ‘planning paradox’ – is explored with reference to pre-war and war-time developments, including Labour\u0027s reactions to the Keynes and White plans of 1943, and to the Bretton Woods conference of 1944. The decision to accept the US loan, and with it the Bretton Woods agreements, is then examined within this context. Finally, an assessment is made of whether, in this key area of policy, Labour\u0027s pre-1945 deliberations were effective in preparing the party for the challenges it would face in government.","bibo:AuthorList":["Toye, Richard"],"dc:date":"2000-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58411,"sim:weight":0.370202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.345792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109116,"sim:weight":0.323066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108636,"sim:weight":0.258525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58478,"sim:weight":0.258352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108419,"sim:weight":0.250742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52137,"sim:weight":0.247775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930218,"sim:weight":0.202065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929836,"sim:weight":0.195024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108245,"sim:weight":0.190257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Much of the criticism levelled at it has charged that the WTO régime puts developing countries at various kinds of unfair disadvantage. Yet concerns about international economic organisations’ treatment of poor nations long pre-dated the WTO. Early consideration of such issues had taken place during the negotiations, in the immediate post-WWII years, which aimed at establishing an International Trade Organization (ITO). This is striking because, although the attempt to create the ITO failed, it left a lasting legacy. Not only was the plan a precursor of the WTO, but the supposedly ‘interim’ General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), negotiated during 1947 in parallel with discussions on the proposed charter for the ITO, continued as the basis on which world trade was regulated, until superseded by the WTO in 1995. The GATT rules of 1947, as subsequently amended, were nested inside the Marrakesh Agreement of 1994 as part of that single agreement. Hence, the spirit of the GATT – and, to some degree, that of the ITO - lives on in the WTO.","bibo:AuthorList":["Toye, Richard"],"dc:date":"2003-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":71478,"sim:weight":0.551111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109132,"sim:weight":0.481923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108539,"sim:weight":0.387534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2752605,"sim:weight":0.383175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67849,"sim:weight":0.349573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":92311,"sim:weight":0.31016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930218,"sim:weight":0.280186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85356,"sim:weight":0.264795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109140,"sim:weight":0.133766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Women and the death penalty in colonial Kenya and Nyasaland, c.1920-57","bibo:abstract":"The position of women and the operation of justice were both contentious issues in colonial Africa. However, when combined in the discussion and sentencing of African women charged with murder and facing the death penalty for their crimes, a relatively coherent gendered discourse emerged: African women were frequently regarded as lacking the emotional and mental development to render them fully responsible for their actions before the law, and consequently liable for the death penalty. What challenged this benevolent, patriarchal discourse were the actions and responses of\nthe women themselves, transgressing supposed gender stereotypes and social hierarchies in their use of lethal violence. This article\nattempts to analyze violent African female crime in Africa through the medium of High Court murder trials in Kenya and Nyasaland,\nfocusing on both colonial judges’ perceptions of women as perpetrators of violent crime and on women’s responses and\nperceptions of their own criminality. Contrary to much existing feminist criminology, this paper will argue that women were not just reluctant killers; they could also be violent in their own right and for their own self-interest.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hynd, Stacey"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.312728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227169,"sim:weight":0.283349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.274719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104038,"sim:weight":0.273244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1395239,"sim:weight":0.263641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176848,"sim:weight":0.258321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56557,"sim:weight":0.241158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.239604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10387,"sim:weight":0.23175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56993,"sim:weight":0.189991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448021,"sim:weight":0.184141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85261,"sim:weight":0.14206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Far from wanting to dictate to people what they should consume, Jay was a planning sceptic who believed that the price mechanism had many virtues. The experience of World War II, however, convinced him of the merits of central planning, and this was reflected in key changes he introduced to the  new edition of The Socialist Case, published in 1947. The changed role envisaged for Jay’s ‘gentleman in Whitehall’ not only illustrates important points about the impact of war on the Labour Party’s attitudes to planning and consumer sovereignty, but also casts light on the relationship between the socialist revisionism of the 1930s and that of subsequent decades.","bibo:AuthorList":["Toye, Richard"],"dc:date":"2002-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":56356,"sim:weight":0.241902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58411,"sim:weight":0.230015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.218539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109116,"sim:weight":0.203288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.202224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176807,"sim:weight":0.1939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.192784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60707,"sim:weight":0.184037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108960,"sim:weight":0.17935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52137,"sim:weight":0.171408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57315,"sim:weight":0.162179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108800,"sim:weight":0.161894,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29421,"sim:weight":0.147961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108898,"sim:weight":0.133688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Understandably, there has been extensive commentary on the ESDP, most of which has focused on the ESDP\u0027s institutional, industrial or military deficiencies. These commentaries have been illuminating but by concentrating on the manifest weaknesses of the ESDP, scholars have perhaps neglected to discuss explicitly how a coherent ESDP could develop. Drawing on recent work by Ben Tonra, this paper discusses the social conditions which are likely to be necessary if the ESDP is to develop into a robust policy. Above all else, a coherent ESDP depends upon the development of a binding sense of mutual obligation between France, Germany and Britain. These nations need to commit themselves to collective defence goals. The paper goes on to argue that for this collective commitment to be developed between these nations, the ESDP requires missions. Only through missions, in which these nations together experience a shared threat, will enduring collective interests and the political will to address them be developed. The future of the ESDP will thus be finally determined by the actions which are carried out in its name. In the end, this may mean that a European defence identity develops not through an independent ESDP but through NATO.","bibo:AuthorList":["King, Anthony"],"dc:date":"2005-04","doi":"10.1080/13523260500116075","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":30516,"sim:weight":0.224755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930821,"sim:weight":0.182884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29209,"sim:weight":0.147171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.126826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It generally refers to the ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ character of an emotion, as well as to the ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ character of some aspect of emotion. After reviewing these different uses, I point to the conceptual problems that come with them. In particular, I distinguish: problems that arise from conflating the valence of an emotion with the valence of its aspects, and problems that arise from the very idea that an emotion (and/or its aspects) can be divided into mutually exclusive opposites. The first group of problems does not question the classic dichotomous notion of valence, but the second does. In order to do justice to the richness of daily emotions, emotion science needs more complex conceptual tools.","bibo:AuthorList":["Colombetti, Giovanna"],"dc:date":"2005-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":28421,"sim:weight":0.462688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85183,"sim:weight":0.263457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109106,"sim:weight":0.259346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85453,"sim:weight":0.172481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.169162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58504,"sim:weight":0.162249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85275,"sim:weight":0.148974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.1423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931412,"sim:weight":0.139079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108891,"sim:weight":0.137948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108452,"sim:weight":0.135087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108747,"sim:weight":0.133231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108547,"sim:weight":0.126133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.124015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57364,"sim:weight":0.116798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29961,"sim:weight":0.107949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Such a focus is entirely valid since the project is being driven forward by nation states. However, the success of the Common Security and Foreign Policy and especially the development of a specifically European military capability under the European Security and Defence Policy will depend not merely on the will of the participating nation-states. Above all, it will depend on the development of a common military culture at the level of weapons development and procurement and at the level of doctrine. The problem is that at neither level is the development of a European culture remotely in sight.","bibo:AuthorList":["King, Anthony"],"dc:date":"2006-09","doi":"10.1080/14702430601060115","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930821,"sim:weight":0.372596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29209,"sim:weight":0.307449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109143,"sim:weight":0.306401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108965,"sim:weight":0.300904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30516,"sim:weight":0.278379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":135083,"sim:weight":0.267813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85458,"sim:weight":0.250501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109140,"sim:weight":0.208347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Or should we go back to what we already know about political integration in Europe and avoid the term? This article reviews recent work in four steps: the identification of the specific domain of Europeanisation; the relationship between Europeanisation, on the one hand, and governance, institutions, and discourse, on the other; the methodological problems and the models emerging in this new field of research; and an assessment of the results arising out of theoretical and empirical research. One theme throughout the article is that, in order to develop a progressive agenda, Europeanisation should be seen as a\nproblem, not as a solution. It is neither a new theory, nor an ad-hoc approach. Rather, it is a way of orchestrating existing concepts and to contribute to cumulative research in political science. Europeanisation does not provide any simple fix to theoretical or empirical problems. Quite the\nopposite, it can deliver if approached as a set of puzzles. A problem in search of explanation – not the explanation itself (Gualini 2003). The conclusion is that Europeanisation has contributed to the\nemergence of new insights, original explanations, and interesting questions on three important issues: the understanding and analysis of \u0027impact\u0027, how to endogeneise international governance in models of domestic politics, and the relationship between agency and change. These three issues\nare prominent in the research agendas of international relations, theoretical policy analysis, and comparative politics. To contribute to major issues at the core of political science is a valuable result for a relatively new field of inquiry.","bibo:AuthorList":["Radaelli, Claudio M."],"dc:date":"2004-10-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930824,"sim:weight":0.310246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84796,"sim:weight":0.261513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85586,"sim:weight":0.249176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104008,"sim:weight":0.237272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.205802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104012,"sim:weight":0.196597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":2735256,"ep:Repository":45,"dc:type":["Technical Report"],"bibo:shortTitle":"What does regulatory impact assessment mean in Europe?","bibo:abstract":"Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) has emerged on the European political agenda. It is an idea whose time has come. Both the member states and the institutions of the European Union (EU) are presently investing in programmes for ‘better regulation’ and ‘good regulatory governance’. RIA is the cornerstone of these programmes. This paper explains how RIA is being diffused in Europe. Is the introduction of RIA in Europe simply the diffusion of an idea, the content of which remains very different in the various national contexts? Or, alternatively, has the diffusion of ideas brought about convergence at the level of how RIA is performed? As shown by Hahn and Litan (2004), European impact assessments are often different from North-American RIAs. This paper shows that the adoption of a common RIA ‘bottle’ has not produced similar European ‘wines’. The language of RIA has produced a community of discourse for policy-makers and has stimulated the introduction of some instruments that are similarly labelled ‘impact assessment’. But RIA practice may exist only on paper, and in some cases the ‘RIA label’ may reveal basic assessments of administrative burdens. The paper explains how ideas can be diffused without convergence of results. The argument here is not the trivial one that ‘context matters’, but how it matters. Hence the paper breaks down ‘context’ into four dimensions, that is, institutions, models of the policy process, actors, and legitimacy. Institutional design, the capacity to deal with distributional problems, heterogeneity in multi-level governance systems, policy styles, and the ‘weights’ given to the preferences of different RIA actors explain the lack of convergence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Radaelli, Claudio M."],"dc:date":"2005-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85586,"sim:weight":0.243659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":2735257,"ep:Repository":45,"dc:type":["Preprint"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Worlds Apart:  the making and remaking of geopolitical space in the US-Uzbekistan strategic partnership","bibo:abstract":"This article analyses the US-Uzbekistan strategic alliance in terms of the illusion of ‘partnership’ which sustained it, the contrasting discourses which constructed and deconstructed it, and the implications of them for the region and the study thereof. Official Uzbek accounts of geopolitics contrast with official American renditions of the Central Asian ‘other’ and their expectations about the pace, place and ethics of Uzbek reform. These contrasts were reconciled for a short period by the illusion of common interests which sustained the strategic partnership. I show how contending representations of the partnership came to a head immediately after the Andijon uprising, amid precipitous national and international developments. These contingencies shattered an unstable discursive compromise, crystalised US and Uzbek policy-maker’s positions, and pitted the two states against one another. Whilst not pre-determined or inevitable, this split was always probable. Nevertheless, these contrasting representations have not disappeared and continue to effect the practice and study of international politics in the region. We must, I argue, understand geopolitical dynamics in the region not in terms of swings of a pendulum ‘between’ East and West, but in terms of the qualitative differences of each power’s power in the region. In other words, it is the exclusion of the United States from a spatially-defined and discursively-constructed region of Central Asia which limits its place in the region. An analysis born out of critical geopolitics calls into question these apparently objective descriptions. Differences between the way the US, Russia and China relate to Uzbekistan are found not so much in their mobilisation of strategic and economic resources, but in terms of their powers of representation, their ability to perform the authority of the Karimov regime. The United States, I conclude, is qualitatively less powerful than Russia and China in Central Asia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heathershaw, John"],"dc:date":"2006-06","doi":"10.1080/02634930701423558","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85690,"sim:weight":0.318357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85220,"sim:weight":0.309343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108636,"sim:weight":0.258142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109143,"sim:weight":0.251789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108965,"sim:weight":0.236483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85630,"sim:weight":0.215232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.172275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.169371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It also discusses how the articles presented here contribute to the solution to problematic aspects of the puzzle. The conclusion reports results achieved in terms of key concepts of regulatory competition, sequences of cooperation and competition, the role of non-unitary actors in networked regulatory action, and why regulatory competition is still limited, both in the EU and in transatlantic relations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Radaelli, Claudio M."],"dc:date":"2004-05","doi":"10.1017/S0143814X04000017","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"C Radaelli.

This change can be witnessed in both mainline evangelicalism as well as within mainstream American popular culture. While parachurch organisations push for youth-abstinence and argue for increasingly more stringent sexual norms for teens and young adults, popular culture has evinced an increasingly more liberalised understanding of sexuality, including the popularisation of figures and images from adult media and increasingly explicit sexual references in popular music. Though both trends appear to convey antithetical sexual mores, I will argue that underneath these contrasting surface appearances their common fascination with sexual experience reflects an unhealthy trend in both popular culture and popular church towards a privatised and disembodied sexuality.  For the Church to respond to an increasingly sexualised culture, it must address her own understanding of human sexuality and the body first. My thesis is a simple one: human sexual experience has become a commodity, a privately consumed good, which is alienated from either the human body or social community.","bibo:AuthorList":["DeLashmutt, Michael"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.248509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53847,"sim:weight":0.24471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108748,"sim:weight":0.207251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66669,"sim:weight":0.196841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108129,"sim:weight":0.174533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109007,"sim:weight":0.173785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930364,"sim:weight":0.152403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84859,"sim:weight":0.147361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930219,"sim:weight":0.141175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108987,"sim:weight":0.13884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85365,"sim:weight":0.136102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It appears that the use of stars survives mainly in smaller settlements still dependent on agriculture\nfor livelihoods, where light pollution is less severe than in the towns, and where the community adheres to traditional practices.\nMany of the stars have different names to those given in the literature on Arabic stars, and the stars used for timing water vary\nsomewhat from one village to another. The method of stargazing also varies among villages: in some the stars are watched rising\nabove the horizon and in others the time is known by the rising or setting of the star above or below a man-made marker, or on its\nreaching the zenith.

We have identified a gene, Magnaporthe metallothionein 1 (MMT1), which is highly expressed throughout growth and development by M. grisea and encodes an unusual 22–amino acid metallothionein-like protein containing only six Cys residues. The MMT1-encoded protein shows a very high affinity for zinc and can act as a powerful antioxidant. Targeted gene disruption of MMT1 produced mutants that show accelerated hyphal growth rates and poor sporulation but had no effect on metal tolerance. Mmt1 mutants are incapable of causing plant disease because of an inability to bring about appressorium-mediated cuticle penetration. Mmt1 appears to be distributed in the inner side of the cell wall of the fungus. These findings indicate that Mmt1-like metallothioneins may play a novel role in fungal cell wall biochemistry that is required for fungal virulence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tucker, Sara L.","Thornton, Christopher R.","Tasker, Karen","Jacob, Claus","Giles, Greg","Egan, Martin","Talbot, Nicholas J."],"dc:date":"2004-06","doi":"10.1105/tpc.021279","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":68675,"sim:weight":0.221086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71821,"sim:weight":0.118822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929927,"sim:weight":0.112382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In a previous study, we confirmed this prediction through the experimental removal of female selection pressures in Drosophila melanogaster, achieved by limiting the expression of all major chromosomes to males. Compared to the control populations (C1-4) where the genomes are exposed to selection in both sexes, the populations with male-limited genomes (ML1-4) showed rapid increases in male fitness, whereas the fitness of females expressing ML-evolved chromosomes decreased [1].\n\t\t\tMethodology/Principal Findings\n\t\t\tHere we examine the behavioural phenotype underlying this sexual antagonism. We show that males expressing the ML genomes have a reduced courtship level but acquire the same number of matings. On the other hand, our data suggest that females expressing the ML genomes had reduced attractiveness, stimulating a lower rate of courtship from males. Moreover, females expressing ML genomes tend to display reduced yeast-feeding behaviour, which is probably linked to the reduction of their fecundity.\n\t\t\tConclusion/Significance\n\t\t\tThese results suggest that reproductive behaviour is shaped by opposing selection on males and females, and that loci influencing attractiveness and foraging were polymorphic for alleles with sexually antagonistic expression patterns prior to ML selection. Hence, intralocus sexual conflict appears to play a role in the evolution of a wide range of fitness-related traits and may be a powerful mechanism for the maintenance of genetic variation in fitness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bedhomme, Stéphanie","Prasad, Nagaraj G.","Jiang, Pan-Pan","Chippindale, Adam K.","Tregenza, Tom"],"dc:date":"2008-05-14","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0002187","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":7031,"sim:weight":0.237902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108684,"sim:weight":0.231768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108618,"sim:weight":0.231245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108971,"sim:weight":0.228705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.120648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The pharmaceutical ethynylestradiol (EE2) is a potent endocrine modulator and is present in the aquatic environment at biologically active concentrations. To investigate impacts on reproductive success and mechanisms of disruption, we exposed breeding populations (n \u003d 12) of zebrafish (Danio rerio) over multiple generations to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2. Life-long exposure to 5 ng/L EE2 in the F1 generation caused a 56% reduction in fecundity and complete population failure with no fertilization. Conversely, the same level of exposure for up to 40 days in mature adults in the parental F0 generation had no impact on reproductive success. Infertility in the F1 generation after life-long exposure to 5 ng/L EE2 was due to disturbed sexual differentiation, with males having no functional testes and either undifferentiated or intersex gonads. These F1 males also showed a reduced vitellogenic response when compared with F0 males, indicating an acclimation to EE2 exposure. Depuration studies found only a partial recovery in reproductive capacity after 5 months. Significantly, even though the F1 males lacked functional testes, they showed male-pattern reproductive behavior, inducing the spawning act and competing with healthy males to disrupt fertilization. Endocrine disruption is therefore likely to affect breeding dynamics and reproductive success in group-spawning fish. Our findings raise major concerns about the population-level impacts for wildlife of long-term exposure to low concentrations of estrogenic endocrine disruptors.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nash, Jon P.","Kime, David E.","Van der Ven, Leo T.

Condition-dependent handicap models of sexual selection predict that (a) sexually selected traits show amplified variability compared to equivalent non-sexually selected traits, and since males are usually the sexually selected sex, that (b) males are more variable than females, and (c) sexually dimorphic traits more variable than monomorphic ones. So far these predictions have only been tested for metric traits. Surprisingly, they have not been examined for bright coloration, one of the most prominent sexual traits. This omission stems from computational difficulties: different types of colours are quantified on different scales precluding the use of coefficients of variation.\n\t\t\tMethodology/Principal Findings\n\t\t\tBased on physiological models of avian colour vision we develop an index to quantify the degree of discriminable colour variation as it can be perceived by conspecifics. A comparison of variability in ornamental and non-ornamental colours in six bird species confirmed (a) that those coloured patches that are sexually selected or act as indicators of quality show increased chromatic variability. However, we found no support for (b) that males generally show higher levels of variability than females, or (c) that sexual dichromatism per se is associated with increased variability.\n\t\t\tConclusions/Significance\n\t\t\tWe show that it is currently possible to realistically estimate variability of animal colours as perceived by them, something difficult to achieve with other traits. Increased variability of known sexually-selected/quality-indicating colours in the studied species, provides support to the predictions borne from sexual selection theory but the lack of increased overall variability in males or dimorphic colours in general indicates that sexual differences might not always be shaped by similar selective forces.","bibo:AuthorList":["Delhey, Kaspar","Peters, Anne","Tregenza, Tom"],"dc:date":"2008-02-27","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0001689","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108618,"sim:weight":0.232901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108971,"sim:weight":0.21885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7031,"sim:weight":0.210003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85539,"sim:weight":0.132014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.120864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.104268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Males of many species transfer compounds in the ejaculate that manipulate female reproductive physiology to increase male reproductive success.

In contrast, in some species ejaculates also contain nutrients used by females for somatic maintenance and increased reproductive output. In general, the extent to which male seminal components are detrimental or beneficial to females is poorly understood, and interactions between seminal compounds with different effects have been almost completely neglected.

Only a small percentage of those genomes have been comprehensively studied, for example using techniques from functional genomics. Comparative analysis has proven to be a useful strategy for enhancing our understanding of evolutionary biology and of the less well understood genomes. However, the data required for these analyses tends to be distributed in various heterogeneous data sources, making systematic comparative studies a cumbersome task. Furthermore, comparative analyses benefit from close integration of derived data sets that cluster genes or organisms in a way that eases the expression of requests that clarify points of similarity or difference between species.\n\t\t\tDescription\n\t\t\tTo support systematic comparative analyses of fungal genomes we have developed the e-Fungi database, which integrates a variety of data for more than 30 fungal genomes. Publicly available genome data, functional annotations, and pathway information has been integrated into a single data repository and complemented with results of comparative analyses, such as MCL and OrthoMCL cluster analysis, and predictions of signaling proteins and the sub-cellular localisation of proteins. To access the data, a library of analysis tasks is available through a web interface. The analysis tasks are motivated by recent comparative genomics studies, and aim to support the study of evolutionary biology as well as community efforts for improving the annotation of genomes. Web services for each query are also available, enabling the tasks to be incorporated into workflows.\n\t\t\tConclusion\n\t\t\tThe e-Fungi database provides fungal biologists with a resource for comparative studies of a large range of fungal genomes.

The ubiquitous dispersal hypothesis states that microbes are so numerous and so easily dispersed worldwide that all should be globally distributed and found wherever growing conditions suit them. This has been broadly upheld for protists (microbial eukaryotes) by most morphological and some molecular analyses. However, morphology and most previously used evolutionary markers evolve too slowly to test this important hypothesis adequately.\n\t\t\tResults\n\t\t\tHere we use a fast-evolving marker (ITS1 rDNA) to map global diversity and distribution of three different clades of cercomonad Protozoa (Eocercomonas and Paracercomonas: phylum Cercozoa) by sequencing multiple environmental gene libraries constructed from 47–80 globally-dispersed samples per group. Even with this enhanced resolution, identical ITS sequences (ITS-types) were retrieved from widely separated sites and on all continents for several genotypes, implying relatively rapid global dispersal. Some identical ITS-types were even recovered from both marine and non-marine samples, habitats that generally harbour significantly different protist communities. Conversely, other ITS-types had either patchy or restricted distributions.\n\t\t\tConclusion\n\t\t\tOur results strongly suggest that geographic dispersal in macro-organisms and microbes is not fundamentally different: some taxa show restricted and/or patchy distributions while others are clearly cosmopolitan. These results are concordant with the \u0027moderate endemicity model\u0027 of microbial biogeography. Rare or continentally endemic microbes may be ecologically significant and potentially of conservational concern. We also demonstrate that strains with identical 18S but different ITS1 rDNA sequences can differ significantly in terms of morphological and important physiological characteristics, providing strong additional support for global protist biodiversity being significantly higher than previously thought.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bass, David","Richards, Thomas A","Matthai, Lena","Marsh, Victoria","Cavalier-Smith, Thomas"],"dc:date":"2007-09-13","doi":"10.1186/1471-2148-7-162","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.197577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393535,"sim:weight":0.187936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.164236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":32132,"sim:weight":0.16267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.162213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26385,"sim:weight":0.138788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.13461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":267462,"sim:weight":0.126981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26936,"sim:weight":0.123187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Perchlorate acts pharmacologically as a competitive inhibitor of thyroidal iodide uptake in mammals, but the impacts of perchlorate contamination in aquatic ecosystems and, in particular, the effects on fish are unclear. Our studies aimed to investigate the effects of concentrations of ammonium perchlorate that can occur in the environment (1, 10, and 100 mg/L) on the development of fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas. For these studies, exposures started with embryos of \u003c 24-hr postfertilization and were terminated after 28 days. Serial sectioning of thyroid follicles showed thyroid hyperplasia with increased follicular epithelial cell height and reduced colloid in all groups of fish that had been exposed to perchlorate for 28 days, compared with control fish. Whole-body thyroxine (T4) content (a measure of total circulating T4 in fish exposed to 100 mg/L perchlorate was elevated compared with the T4 content of control fish, but 3,5,3-triiodothyronine (T3) content was not significantly affected in any exposure group. Despite the apparent regulation of T3, after 28 days of exposure to ammonium perchlorate, fish exposed to the two higher levels (10 and 100 mg/L) were developmentally retarded, with a lack of scales and poor pigmentation, and significantly lower wet weight and standard length than were control fish. Our study indicates that environmental levels of ammonium perchlorate affect thyroid function in fish and that in the early life stages these effects may be associated with developmental retardation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Crane, Helen M.","Pickford, Daniel B.","Hutchinson, Thomas H.","Brown, J.

Insect Physiol., in the press]. The ovaries of mature adult female A. domesticus in vitro convert [3H]ecdysone into apolar conjugates identical with those found in newly laid eggs. Comparison of the radioactive metabolites produced on incubation of [3H]ecdysone with various organs of adult female A. domesticus in vitro indicate that the fat-body is the major producer of polar ecdysteroid metabolites at this stage of development, whereas the ovaries are the major site of production of apolar metabolites. Apolar metabolites are also produced to a lesser extent by the crop, gut sections and the fat-body. Hydrolysis of radioactive metabolites produced by the ovaries with Helix enzymes releases only [3H]ecdysone, and thus ecdysone is not metabolized before conjugation by the ovaries. Formation of chemical derivatives (acetonide and acetates) of these 3H-labelled apolar conjugates strongly indicates that the position of conjugation is through the hydroxy group at C-22 of ecdysone. Extensive chromatographic analysis of the 3H-labelled apolar metabolites produced by the ovaries by t.l.c. and h.p.l.c. and comparison with authenticated reference compounds have conclusively demonstrated that the conjugates consist of ecdysone esterified at C-22 to a mixture of common long-chain fatty acids. The major fatty acyl esters have been identified and their percentage contribution to the mixture determined: laurate (0.5%), myristate (2.8%), palmitate (25.8%), stearate (8.4%), arachidate (1.0%), oleate (15.7%), linoleate (38.8%) and linolenate (2.1%). In addition there are three minor unidentified peaks, one of which has been tentatively identified as ecdysone 22-palmitoleate (2.6%). Comparison of this percentage composition with the previously published fatty acid composition of A. domesticus haemolymph [Wang \u0026 Patton (1969) J.

A study was made of the biodegradation of alkylbenzene sulphonate homologues, one of the major components of commercially marketed detergents. A Bacillus species was elected for growth on alkylbenzene sulphonate homologues as the sole source of carbon and sulphur. 2. The results from both whole-cell and cell-free systems indicated that the alkyl, aryl and sulphonate moieties of alkylbenzene sulphonate homologues were all further metabolized by the Bacillus species. 3. The alkyl side chain, after a presumed initial oxidation of the terminal methyl group, was subsequently oxidized by a beta-oxidation pathway. Three enzymes of the beta-oxidation pathway, i.e. acyl-CoA synthetase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, were identified in cell-free extracts of the detergent-grown Bacillus species. The substrate specificity of acyl-CoA synthetase indicated activity towards several alkylbenzene sulphonate homologues. 4. The sulphonate moiety was released as sulphite by a desulphonating enzyme. Some kinetic properties of this enzyme were determined. The sulphite was subsequently metabolized to either sulphate or adenosine 5\u0027-sulphatophosphate. Two enzymes involved in sulphite metabolism, i.e. sulphite-cytochrome c reductase and adenosine 5\u0027-sulphatophosphate-cytochrome c reductase were detected in cell-free extracts of undecylbenzene-p-sulphonate-grown Bacillus species. 5. The combined results of continuous sampling programmes monitored by both t.l.c. and sulphite appearance in the growth medium indicated that desulphonation of the aromatic moiety was the likely first step in the overall biodegradation of several alkylbenzene sulphonate homologues. 6. The presence of p-hydroxyphenylpropionate, p-hydroxybenzoate and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate in cells after growth on several alkylbenzene sulphonate homologues containing an odd number of carbon atoms in the side chain was confirmed by g.l.c. and t.l.c. analysis. Cells grown on several homologues containing an even number of carbon atoms in the side chain were shown to contain p-hydroxyphenylacetate and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate. 7. The aromatic nucleus obtained from undecylbenzene-p-sulphonate was further metabolized by an oxidation sequence involving an ;ortho-cleavage\u0027 route. 8.

The aim was to identify changes in metabolism that might be relevant to the perception of low soil water potential and the subsequent adaptation of the tissue to these conditions. Osmotic shock was found to result in two different types of response: changes in metabolite levels and changes in intracellular pH. The most notable metabolic changes, which were produced by all the osmotica tested, were increases in phosphocholine and vacuolar phosphate, with a transient increase in cytoplasmic phosphate. It was observed that treatment with ionic and nonionic osmotica produced different effects on the concentrations of bioenergetically important metabolites. It is postulated that these changes are the result of hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine and other membrane phospholipids, due to differential activation of specific membrane-associated phospholipases by changes in the surface tension of the plasmalemma. These events may be important in the detection of osmotic shock and subsequent acclimatization. A cytoplasmic alkalinization was also observed during hyperosmotic treatment, and this response, which is consistent with the activation of the plasmalemma H+-ATPase, together with the other metabolic changes, may suggest the existence of a complex and integrated mechanism of osmoregulation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spickett, Corinne M.","Smirnoff, Nicholas","Ratcliffe, R.

A number of hypotheses have been formulated to explain factors shaping patterns of variation in animal mass. One such example is Bergmann\u0027s rule, which predicts that body size will be positively correlated with latitude and elevation, and hence, with decreasing environmental temperatures. A generally accepted explanation for this phenotypic response is that as body mass increases, body surface area gets proportionally smaller, which contributes to reduced rates of heat-loss. Phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic evidence reveals that endotherms follow Bergmann\u0027s rule. In contrast, while previous non-phylogenetic studies supported this prediction in up to 75% of ectotherms, recent phylogenetic comparative analyses suggest that its validity for these organisms is controversial and less understood. Moreover, little attention has been paid to why some ectotherms conform to this rule, while others do not. Here, we investigate Bergmann\u0027s rule in the six main clades forming the Liolaemus genus, one of the largest and most environmentally diverse genera of terrestrial vertebrates. A recent study conducted on some species belonging to four of these six clades concluded that Liolaemus species follow Bergmann\u0027s rule, representing the only known phylogenetic support for this model in lizards. However, a later reassessment of this evidence, performed on one of the four analysed clades, produced contrasting conclusions.\n\t\t\tResults\n\t\t\tOur results fail to support Bergmann\u0027s rule in Liolaemus lizards. Non-phylogenetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that none of the studied clades experience increasing body size with increasing latitude and elevation.\n\t\t\tConclusion\n\t\t\tMost physiological and behavioural processes in ectotherms depend directly upon their body temperature. In cold environments, adaptations to gain heat rapidly are under strong positive selection to allow optimal feeding, mating and predator avoidance. Therefore, evolution of larger body size in colder environments appears to be a disadvantageous thermoregulatory strategy. The repeated lack of support for Bergmann\u0027s rule in ectotherms suggests that this model should be recognized as a valid rule exclusively for endotherms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pincheira-Donoso, Daniel","Hodgson, David J","Tregenza, Tom"],"dc:date":"2008-02-27","doi":"10.1186/1471-2148-8-68","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":15552,"sim:weight":0.267763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85444,"sim:weight":0.198471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25053,"sim:weight":0.197459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.162359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.140389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29441,"sim:weight":0.132246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.127793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31144,"sim:weight":0.120502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7031,"sim:weight":0.11237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We review here these systems, which are currently mainly used in vitro with cultured cells in order to analyse the role of a wide array of genes, but which are expected to represent the basis for future gene therapy strategies. Such developments raise several questions, which are addressed in detail. First, the metabolic fate of ecdysteroids in mammals, including humans, is only poorly known, and the rapid catabolism of ecdysteroids may impede their use as in vivo inducers. A second set of questions arose in fact much earlier with the pioneering \"heterophylic\" studies of Burdette in the early sixties on the pharmacological effects of ecdysteroids on mammals. These and subsequent studies showed a wide range of effects, most of them being beneficial for the organism (e.g. hypoglycaemic, hypocholesterolaemic, anabolic). These effects are reviewed and critically analysed, and some hypotheses are proposed to explain the putative mechanisms involved. All of these pharmacological effects have led to the development of a wide array of ecdysteroid-containing preparations, which are primarily used for their anabolic and/or \"adaptogenic\" properties on humans (or horses or dogs). In the same way, increasing numbers of patents have been deposited concerning various beneficial effects of ecdysteroids in many medical or cosmetic domains, which make ecdysteroids very attractive candidates for several practical uses. It may be questioned whether all these pharmacological actions are compatible with the development of ecdysteroid-inducible gene switches for gene therapy, and also if ecdysteroids should be classified among doping substances.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lafont, R.","Dinan, L."],"dc:date":"2003-03-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":135088,"sim:weight":0.21276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85444,"sim:weight":0.207728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":135024,"sim:weight":0.207702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.186843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.186843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.153883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108494,"sim:weight":0.139406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.13345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here we propose that behavioural traits involved in sexual advertisement may serve as good indicators of personality, which is fundamental for sexual selection to operate on temperament. Bird song has a prominent and well-established role in sexual selection, and it displays considerable variation among individuals with a potentially strong personality component. Therefore, we predicted that features of song would correlate with estimates of personality.\n\t\t\tMethodology/Principal Findings\n\t\t\tIn a field study of free-living male collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, we characterised personality based on the exploration of an altered breeding environment, and based on the risk taken when a potential predator was approaching during a simulated territorial interaction. We found that explorative and risk-taker individuals consistently sang at lower song posts than shy individuals in the presence of a human observer. Moreover, males from lower posts established pair-bonds relatively faster than males from higher posts.\n\t\t\tConclusions/Significance\n\t\t\tOur results may demonstrate that risk taking during singing correlates with risk taking during aggression and with exploration, thus personality may be manifested in different contexts involving sexual advertisement. These findings are in accordance with the hypothesis that the male\u0027s balance between investment in reproduction and risk taking is reflected in sexual displays, and it may be important information for choosy females that seek partners with personality traits enhancing breeding success.","bibo:AuthorList":["Garamszegi, László Zsolt","Eens, Marcel","Török, János","Tregenza, Tom"],"dc:date":"2008-07-09","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0002647","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8929418,"sim:weight":0.364165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7031,"sim:weight":0.271352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108971,"sim:weight":0.239149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108618,"sim:weight":0.20857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.199885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108387,"sim:weight":0.158193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108980,"sim:weight":0.121217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Together with matching races of its co-mimic Heliconius melpomene, H. erato also represents a textbook case of Müllerian mimicry, a phenomenon where common warning signals are shared amongst noxious organisms. It is of great interest to identify the specific genes that control the mimetic wing patterns of H. erato and H. melpomene. To this end we have undertaken comparative mapping and targeted genomic sequencing in both species. This paper reports on a comparative analysis of genomic sequences linked to color pattern mimicry genes in Heliconius.\n\t\t\tResults\n\t\t\tScoring AFLP polymorphisms in H. erato broods allowed us to survey loci at approximately 362 kb intervals across the genome. With this strategy we were able to identify markers tightly linked to two color pattern genes: D and Cr, which were then used to screen H. erato BAC libraries in order to identify clones for sequencing. Gene density across 600 kb of BAC sequences appeared relatively low, although the number of predicted open reading frames was typical for an insect. We focused analyses on the D- and Cr-linked H. erato BAC sequences and on the Yb-linked H. melpomene BAC sequence. A comparative analysis between homologous regions of H. erato (Cr-linked BAC) and H. melpomene (Yb-linked BAC) revealed high levels of sequence conservation and microsynteny between the two species. We found that repeated elements constitute 26% and 20% of BAC sequences from H. erato and H. melpomene respectively. The majority of these repetitive sequences appear to be novel, as they showed no significant similarity to any other available insect sequences. We also observed signs of fine scale conservation of gene order between Heliconius and the moth Bombyx mori, suggesting that lepidopteran genome architecture may be conserved over very long evolutionary time scales.\n\t\t\tConclusion\n\t\t\tHere we have demonstrated the tractability of progressing from a genetic linkage map to genomic sequence data in Heliconius butterflies. We have also shown that fine-scale gene order is highly conserved between distantly related Heliconius species, and also between Heliconius and B. mori.

However, individual differences in female preference functions and their proximate causation have rarely been studied.\n\t\t\tMethodology/Principal Findings\n\t\t\tCalling songs of male field crickets represent secondary sexual characters and are subject to sexual selection by female choice. Following predictions from the “matched filter hypothesis” we studied the tuning of an identified interneuron in a field cricket, known for its function in phonotaxis, and correlated this with the preference of the same females in two-choice trials. Females vary in their neuronal frequency tuning, which strongly predicts the preference in a choice situation between two songs differing in carrier frequency. A second “matched filter” exists in directional hearing, where reliable cues for sound localization occur only in a narrow frequency range. There is a strong correlation between the directional tuning and the behavioural preference in no-choice tests. This second “matched filter” also varies widely in females, and surprisingly, differs on average by 400 Hz from the neuronal frequency tuning.\n\t\t\tConclusions/Significance\n\t\t\tOur findings on the mismatch of the two “matched filters” would suggest that the difference in these two filters appears to be caused by their evolutionary history, and the different trade-offs which exist between sound emission, transmission and detection, as well as directional hearing under specific ecological settings. The mismatched filter situation may ultimately explain the maintenance of considerable variation in the carrier frequency of the male signal despite stabilizing selection.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kostarakos, Konstantinos","Hartbauer, Manfred","Römer, Heiner","Tregenza, Tom"],"dc:date":"2008-08-20","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108971,"sim:weight":0.203024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108618,"sim:weight":0.203021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85444,"sim:weight":0.193129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7031,"sim:weight":0.184532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86191,"sim:weight":0.107114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In addition, it recently became evident that U. maydis and humans share proteins and cellular processes that are not found in the standard fungal model Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This prompted us to do a comparative analysis of the predicted proteome of U. maydis, S. cerevisiae and humans.\n\t\t\tResults\n\t\t\tAt a cut off at 20% identity over protein length, all three organisms share 1738 proteins, whereas both fungi share only 541 conserved proteins. Despite the evolutionary distance between U. maydis and humans, 777 proteins were shared. When applying a more stringent criterion (≥ 20% identity with a homologue in one organism over at least 50 amino acids and ≥ 10% less in the other organism), we found 681 proteins for the comparison of U. maydis and humans, whereas the both fungi share only 622 fungal specific proteins. Finally, we found that S. cerevisiae and humans shared 312 proteins. In the U. maydis to H. sapiens homology set 454 proteins are functionally classified and 42 proteins are related to serious human diseases. However, a large portion of 222 proteins are of unknown function.\n\t\t\tConclusion\n\t\t\tThe fungus U. maydis has a long history of being a model system for understanding DNA recombination and repair, as well as molecular plant pathology.

They have been shown to be functionally and medically significant, and are associated with cancers and neuro-degenerative diseases such as Huntington\u0027s Chorea, where a poly-glutamine repeat is responsible for causing the disease. The COPASAAR database is a new tool to facilitate the rapid analysis of single amino acid repeats at a proteome level. The database aims to simplify the comparison of repeat distributions between proteomes in order to provide a better understanding of their function and evolution.\n\t\t\tResults: \n\t\t\tA comparative analysis of all proteomes in the database (currently 244) shows that single amino acid repeats account for about 12–14% of the proteome of any given species. They are more common in eukaryotes (14%) than in either archaea or bacteria (both 13%). Individual analyses of proteomes show that long single amino acid repeats (6+ residues) are much more common in the Eukaryotes and that longer repeats are usually made up of hydrophilic amino acids such as glutamine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid and serine.\n\t\t\tConclusion: \n\t\t\tCOPASAAR is a useful tool for comparative proteomics that provides rapid access to amino acid repeat data that can be readily data-mined. The COPASAAR database can be queried at the kingdom, proteome or individual protein level. As the amount of available proteome data increases this will be increasingly important in order to automate proteome comparison. The insights gained from these studies will give a better insight into the evolution of protein sequence and function.","bibo:AuthorList":["Depledge, Daniel P","Dalby, Andrew R"],"dc:date":"2005-08-03","doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-6-196","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931285,"sim:weight":0.587808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.187587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":135088,"sim:weight":0.165573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24079,"sim:weight":0.165465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.16094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.14546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":332871,"sim:weight":0.141613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.115485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26718,"sim:weight":0.0979972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In Experiment 1, the training stimuli were sets of images of dogs and cats, and the transfer stimuli were head/body chimeras, which humans tend to categorize more readily in terms of the head part rather than the body part. In Experiment 2, the training stimuli were sets of images of heads of dogs and cats, and the intermediate stimuli were computer-generated morphs. In both experiments, pigeons learned the concept discrimination quickly and generalized with some decrement to novel instances of the categories. In both experiments, transfer tests were carried out with intermediate forms generated from both familiar and novel exemplars of the training sets. In Experiment 1, the pigeons\u0027 transfer performance, unlike that of human infants exposed to similar stimuli, was best predicted by the body part of the stimulus when the chimeras were formed from familiar exemplars. Spatial frequency analysis of the stimuli showed that the body parts were richer in high spatial frequencies than the head parts, so these data are consistent with the hypothesis that categorization is more dependent on local stimulus features in pigeons than in humans. There was no corresponding trend when the chimeras were formed from novel exemplars. In Experiment 2, when morphs of training stimuli were used, response rates declined smoothly as the proportion of the morph contributed by the positive stimulus fell, although results with morphs of novel stimuli were again less orderly.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ghosh, Natasha","Lea, Stephen E G","Noury, Malia"],"dc:date":"2004-09","doi":"10.1901/jeab.2004.82-125","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85875,"sim:weight":0.329341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85863,"sim:weight":0.328481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85884,"sim:weight":0.275537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8997995,"sim:weight":0.237834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84778,"sim:weight":0.199927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85083,"sim:weight":0.131672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69995,"sim:weight":0.128299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85539,"sim:weight":0.121075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Density-dependent selection may also promote cyclic changes in frequencies of genotypes. Here we show evidence for both density-dependent and negative frequency-dependent selection on opposite life-history tactics (low or high reproductive effort, RE) in the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Density-dependent selection was evident among the females with low RE, which were especially favored in low densities. Instead, both negative frequency-dependent and density-dependent selection were shown in females with high RE, which were most successful when they were rare in high densities. Furthermore, selection at the individual level affected the frequencies of tactics at the population level, so that the frequency of the rare high RE tactic increased significantly at high densities. We hypothesize that these two selection mechanisms (density- and negative frequency-dependent selection) may promote genetic variability in cyclic mammal populations. Nevertheless, it remains to be determined whether the origin of genetic variance in life-history traits is causally related to density variation (e.g. population cycles).","bibo:AuthorList":["Mappes, Tapio","Koivula, Minna","Koskela, Esa","Oksanen, Tuula A.","Savolainen, Tiina","Sinervo, Barry","Tregenza, Tom"],"dc:date":"2008-02-27","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0001687","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8931825,"sim:weight":0.271682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108390,"sim:weight":0.209207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26715,"sim:weight":0.146244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86227,"sim:weight":0.142624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25907,"sim:weight":0.141597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7031,"sim:weight":0.133951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Yet neither education for citizenship, nor its relationship with religious education, is new. Evidence for this is provided by an analysis of the public discourse pertaining to these areas, which took place between 1934 and 1944, with a focus on three influential participants: Cyril Norwood, Ernest Simon and William Temple. This paper highlights the extent to which (i) religious education was conceived as a form of education for citizenship and (ii) Christian educationists precluded secular and pedagogically progressive education for citizenship from developing in English schools. This helps to explain why Religious Instruction and worship became compulsory components of school provision in England and why education for citizenship took so long to gain a firm foothold in the curriculum.","bibo:AuthorList":["Freathy, R.J.K."],"dc:date":"2008-01","doi":"10.1080/01416200701831036","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":61043,"sim:weight":0.461246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.227341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.183632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.153184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As part of a longitudinal study students were asked to express their thoughts and feelings about life in Year 8, which is considered by some as a year in which little progress is made and there is a ‘falling off’ of attitudes to learning. Students were asked to give their opinions about their learning experiences in Year 8, and whether they still enjoyed the subjects they had been looking forward to prior to transfer to the secondary school.  They were also asked for the reasons they attributed to doing well or not doing well at school. Their views about the usefulness of homework were sought, and they offered ideas of how they thought its’ usefulness could be improved.  The results revealed that the majority of students in this large secondary school did not feel that they were ’marking time’ and that they were working harder and learning more than they did in Year 7. In this respect these findings did not support those of previous studies concerning students’ commitment and motivation to their learning in Year 8. The research revealed gender differences with regard to their perceived reasons for doing more or less well at school and to what they attributed success or failure in their learning.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chedzoy, Susan M.","Burden, Robert"],"dc:date":"2007-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.451138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60331,"sim:weight":0.449141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108976,"sim:weight":0.384413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57289,"sim:weight":0.378361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.377191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109202,"sim:weight":0.361426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23990,"sim:weight":0.283377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As in certain branches of philosophy, language teaching has perhaps clung too long to the first of these notions of authenticity at the expense of the other. This paper reviews four key conceptualisations of authenticity which have emerged in the field of applied linguistics: text authenticity, authenticity of language competence, learner authenticity and classroom authenticity. If any of these types of authenticity is couched exclusively in terms of one usage or the other, it can lead to an impoverishment and objectification of the experience of language learning. Text authenticity can lead to a poverty of language; authenticity of competence can lead to a poverty of performance; learner authenticity can lead to a poverty of interpretation; classroom authenticity can lead to a poverty of communication. This paper proposes that a pedagogy of intercultural communication be informed by a more hybrid view of authenticity as a process of subjectification, derived from the Heideggerian concept of self-concern.","bibo:AuthorList":["MacDonald, Malcolm","Badger, Richard","Dasli, Maria"],"dc:date":"2006","doi":"10.2167/laic252.0","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This is possibly reflected in the emphasis on the importance of explicit verbal reasoning in definitions of ‘Exploratory Talk’: a concept that has had some influence on classroom teaching. In this paper I argue from transcript evidence that, while Exploratory Talk is a specific dialogical model of reason that has proved to be a useful pedagogic tool, there are educationally valuable ways of talking together that are characterised more by verbal creativity than by explicit reasoning. Close analysis of actual dialogues highlights the essential importance of verbal creativity even to the task of solving reasoning test problems in small groups. This analysis also suggests that the extent and quality of creativity found in classroom dialogues is influenced by shared ground rules. This implies the need to expand our understanding of dialogical reason to incorporate creativity and to develop dialogical models to support the stimulation and channelling of creativity in educational contexts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wegerif, Rupert"],"dc:date":"2005","doi":"10.1080/09500780508668676","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109170,"sim:weight":0.32593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85624,"sim:weight":0.249956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.196466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.190229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27452,"sim:weight":0.145841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84939,"sim:weight":0.144035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Questionnaires were constructed based on hypotheses generated by previous research in relation to student expectations about general Secondary school ethos, academic work, relationships with teachers and peers and aspects of personal development.  The same students were followed up after one term in Secondary school to assess whether their expectations had been confirmed.\n\nThe results confirm previous findings concerning the existence of rites-of-passage myths, often aided by Primary school teachers, about the difficulties likely to be met during the transition period.  However, they also demonstrate the disconfirmation of those myths for most students after a relatively short period of time, especially with regard to psycho-social relationships.  At the same time, there are clear indications of an ongoing need for careful consideration of the most appropriate form of learning experiences immediately after transfer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chedzoy, Susan M.","Burden, Robert"],"dc:date":"2005-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.370827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.348522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.297797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26615,"sim:weight":0.254193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.243491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":2735432,"ep:Repository":45,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Religious Beliefs: a hidden variable in the performance of science teachers in the classroom","bibo:abstract":"This article focuses on some of the challenges of teaching science in a culture where science and religion sometimes appear to be or are set at odds with each other. Apparent conflicts between scholarly claims and religious claims are not limited to science, however – they occur in almost every subject. Many topics included in science education are acknowledged as controversial issues, for example, evolution, cloning, abortion and genetic engineering. These issues pose problems for science teachers, especially in a religiously based culture, because of the nature of the conflict between the implications of a scientific study of some of these issues and religion. Some other issues may not formally conflict with religion but teachers’ views, or the way they interpret the religious view regarding these controversial issues, can create a false contradiction, which might influence their performance and, in turn, influence their students’ learning. Therefore, there is a need to understand teachers’ personal religious beliefs and practices around some of these, and the way their beliefs influence their performance in the classroom. This article describes a study conducted to address these needs. The study looks at the role and influence of religion on the science teacher’s performance. The findings highlighted the powerful influence of teachers’ religious beliefs in dealing with or gaining new knowledge (the epistemology and the ontology of science). Also, the findings found that teachers’ religious beliefs are among the major constructs that drive teachers’ ways of thinking and classroom practices about scientific issues related to religion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mansour, Nasser"],"dc:date":"2008","doi":"10.2304/eerj.2008.7.4.557","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108075,"sim:weight":0.383683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84939,"sim:weight":0.355296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85391,"sim:weight":0.34369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.331653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.316997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821117,"sim:weight":0.312429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.272803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85165,"sim:weight":0.245937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.226423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61043,"sim:weight":0.222636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26615,"sim:weight":0.183087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this paper we describe a research project designed to explore the hypothesis that this case of underperformance, like others, results from a mismatch between the registers learnt at home and those assumed in education. The method used was to offer extra support for those oral registers required for understanding in the classroom by providing trained adult \u0027talking partners\u0027 for young bilingual pupils. Sixty four pupils, aged between five and eight years, were given this additional oral language support and their progress in language and learning was then compared to that of similar pupils in the same schools. The findings show that extra sessions with adult talking partners made a real difference to their spoken English in an educational context and so to their engagement in education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wegerif, Rupert","Kotler, Angie","Levoi, Martin"],"dc:date":"2007-12-19T16:55:25Z","doi":"10.1080/13670050108667740","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A questionnaire was developed according to the recommended procedures and was administered to 128 final-year teacher trainees in two primary-teacher training courses in England. A variety of predictors were identified including: beliefs of significant others, such as parents; a positive assessment of control over difficult barriers; and experiences of past (teaching) behavior. The most significant predictor in discriminating between intenders and nonintenders, however, was personal exercise behavior. Helping preservice primary-school teachers become more physically active themselves might positively influence their intentions to teach physical education 2 hr per week more than alleviating barriers to teaching physical education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Faulkner, Guy","Reeves, Colin","Chedzoy, Susan M."],"dc:date":"2004-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5847093,"sim:weight":0.366353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109069,"sim:weight":0.348866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176799,"sim:weight":0.307713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56477,"sim:weight":0.278336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.270763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108663,"sim:weight":0.261351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26615,"sim:weight":0.178299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It draws on the results of a pilot study among students of post-compulsory school stage studying French in England. Through a detailed analysis of students’ reactions to texts, it demonstrates that the use of ‘authentic’ documents under currently held notions of ‘authenticity’ may have a negative affective impact on learners. Authors and designers of texts make assumptions about an original, intended readership which influence visual design, assumptions which are not necessarily borne out in the foreign language learning situation. There is a need to examine texts for their format as well as their content, to move away from equating ‘authentic’ with ‘identical’ and to using electronic design to improve readability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Maun, Ian"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108961,"sim:weight":0.297707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108297,"sim:weight":0.276512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66374,"sim:weight":0.274459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821117,"sim:weight":0.242477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108385,"sim:weight":0.231328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.227749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108359,"sim:weight":0.226316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85336,"sim:weight":0.223493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84939,"sim:weight":0.221281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.218528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108929,"sim:weight":0.211831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108452,"sim:weight":0.199845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27091,"sim:weight":0.18317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Secondly, there are specific characteristics of\nEnglish grammar which cause confusion, particularly the mobility of word class.\nFinally, the process of acquiring metalinguistic knowledge can be hampered by cognitive\ndifficulties relatedto the conceptual demands of grammar, the transfer of learning\nfrom passive to active understanding, and the patterns of inter-connected learning in\ngrammar.

They advocated a conservative and elitist form of education for citizenship as taught through indirect training, Arnoldian public school traditions and ecumenical, liberal Protestantism. This contrasted with the conception of education for citizenship promoted by the founder members of the Association for Education in Citizenship. They wanted pupils to be educated into a liberal, democratic and secular version of English citizenship by means of \u0027progressive\u0027 pedagogies and direct instruction. This article identifies the ecclesiastical and religious factors which preserved the Christian and traditional form of education for citizenship in English schools between 1934 and 1944. These factors included the revival of the Christian foundations of British national identity and citizenship, the development and acceptance of non-denominational forms of Christian education, the increasingly positive response which an evermore coherent and professionalised cohort of Christian educationists received from the Board of Education and the Consultative Committee, and the political power of the Anglican Church within the dual system combined with the religious settlement agreed in the 1944 Education Act.","bibo:AuthorList":["Freathy, R.

This discourse in the instance of its articulation realises and sustains Intercultural Communication epistemologically – as an academic field of social enquiry, and judgementally – as one which locates itself on a moral terrain. By adopting an ethical stance towards difference, the discourse of intercultural communication finds itself caught in a series of aporias, or performative contradictions, where interculturalists are projected simultaneously into positions of cultural relativism on the one hand and ideological totalism on the other. Such aporias arise because the theoretical premises upon which the discourse relies are problematic. We trace these thematics to a politics of presence operating within the discourse of intercultural communication and link this to questions of judgement and truth in the intercultural public sphere. We propose that the politics of presence be set aside in favour of an intercultural praxis which is oriented to responsibility rather than to truth.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Regan, John P.","MacDonald, Malcolm"],"dc:date":"2007","doi":"10.2167/laic287.0","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Drawing on sociocultural perspectives, it shows that expectations of talk are grounded in particular sociocultural values that represent hegemonic interpretations of the quality of talk and classroom discourse. Although much has been written about classroom talk, the pupils\u0027 voice is often absent from discussion. The children in this study revealed very different views of the expectations of talk from that of their teachers\u0027. In particular, they appeared uncertain about whether their teachers liked them to talk but they seemed very clear that the teacher was in control of the talk. Despite pupils\u0027 enthusiasm for talk, their teachers held negative views of certain pupils\u0027 performance. It is argued that both pupils\u0027 and teachers\u0027 expectations are guided more by their own perceptions of an ideal state than by pedagogic or heuristic motives.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fisher, Ros","Larkin, Shirley"],"dc:date":"2008-01","doi":"10.2167/le706.0","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The article outlines the principal characteristics of students’ writing at the outset of the study, and then reports on the same students’ writing after using the invention techniques.  Statistical data highlighted how the two experimental groups had improved their writing more than the control group at a level of statistical significance.

Various theories have emerged, with boys’ poor performance being attributed to a changing economic infrastructure, to the results of poor parenting or to innate biological differences where, for example, they are perceived as being less able than girls to learn language. In this paper, I contribute to the debate by reporting a selection of the findings from a research project in a cluster of schools, where students from Year 1 (ages 5-6) to Year 11 (ages 15-16) and their teachers were interviewed about their perceptions and attitudes to learning and gender, and were observed in the classroom. While I provide much comment about raising standards and improving classroom practice for all students, I specifically focus on underachieving boys and on literacy. Data on the perceptions of children in Years 4 and 5 (ages 8-10) are presented here. Findings relating to the Early Years children and their teachers are reported in Wood (2001) and data on patterns of interaction and response in Years 1- 8 in Myhill (2002).","bibo:AuthorList":["Holden, Cathie"],"dc:date":"2002-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Lessons on affirmative action from South African employment law","bibo:abstract":"This article evaluates the usefulness of affirmative action, which appears to have become the cornerstone of South Africa’s campaign to achieve racial equality. Whether or not affirmative action is an effective tool to combat disadvantage depends on the legislative approach and its best application to the specific problems. The approach taken by South Africa re-opens the debate on affirmative action and offers the international community a new perspective on overcoming past wrong. The importance of the subject is reopened particularly now that South Africa is at the forefront of the definition and implementation of what is generally termed affirmative action.\n\nIn 1996 South Africa constructed a Constitution that entails an equality clause and makes reference to racial equality in several other provisions (Employment Equity Act, Act 55 of 1998, and its forerunner the Labour Relations Act, Act 66 of 1995, the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, Act 4 of 2000, and the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act (Act 53 of 2003)). The means to achieve racial equality and to overcome the legacy of past discrimination is without doubt a form of equality intended to compensate for that history through affirmative action (hereinafter referred to as restitutionary equality). Nevertheless, after more than ten years of democracy, enormous disparities between black and white still characterise employment. Despite the repeal of many discriminatory laws in employment such as the reservation of jobs for white people, high profile jobs are still occupied mainly by white people and white people still get the higher salaries (see Commission for Employment Equity 2007, Forgey et. al., 2000, at p. 294-296). Poverty today remains a black characteristic and as such is rising, even though there has been an increase in the average personal income (South African Institute of Race Relations, 2003). This article argues that not enough has been done to make restitutionary equality work at its best.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bosch, Grete S."],"dc:date":"2007-09-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The overall approach of the UK government to the draft Treaty was clearly summarised by the Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, when he introduced the White Paper to the House of Commons on 9 September 2003. He there stated that “the proposals in the current draft Treaty do not change the fundamental relationship between the EU and its Member States; and on any analysis it involves less change than that in Maastricht and the Single European Act”. With the benefit of hindsight, it is interesting to observe that on that basis he suggested that there was no need for a referendum, and that the outcome of the IGC should be decided upon by Parliament. Whatever the vagaries of domestic politics which have led to the 2004 Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe which resulted from the Intergovernmental Conference being subject to a referendum in the UK, that Treaty does in fact effect a number of institutional changes which taken together may be regarded as of some importance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Usher, John"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The scheme has a 65 per cent settlement rate and litigants who have taken part in mediation have, on the whole, expressed satisfaction with the scheme.  Yet of more concern is the possibility that institutionalising informal methods of dispute resolution into more formal court processes may raise substantial issues in relation to quality of standards, the training of court-appointed mediators and litigants-in-person understanding of how mediation works.  It is argued that these issues need to be considered before mediation can be successfully integrated into the civil legal system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Prince, Sue"],"dc:date":"2007-11-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Although they have traditionally adopted very different approaches to family law, their response to the phenomenon of cohabitation has traditionally been surprisingly similar. In both, the law has developed piecemeal, leaving cohabitants with inadequate legal remedies, and the article first compares the current law in the two jurisdictions. However, the French government has now demonstrated its willingness to confront the legal needs of cohabitants. Proposed French legislation both acknowledges a legal status of cohabitation - whether heterosexual or homosexual and in addition will permit all unmarried cohabitants to enter into a civil union contract known as a PACS. This will approximate their position more closely to that of married couples for all purposes, including social security benefits, inheritance, maintenance and property division on relationship breakdown. In contrast, the British Government\u0027s Consultation Document Supporting Families (1998) virtually ignores the needs of cohabitants focusing instead on strengthening marriage. The article goes on, therefore, to analyse and contrast the impact of this new divergence in approach between the two jurisdictions, and assesses its significance in the light of reforms being implemented elsewhere in Europe.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barlow, Anne","Probert, Rebecca"],"dc:date":"1999-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Until recently it has had a low profile, appearing in just a handful of race relations cases concerning instructions to discriminate. However, the European Court of Justice, after a reference made to it by an employment tribunal, will rule on whether it has a wider application. If it does so, the effect in English law will be wide-ranging and of great importance. In addition, the government\u0027s Green Paper on the Single Equality Bill also addresses the issue. The present state of the law and the arguments for and against extending discrimination by association are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Honeyball, Simon"],"dc:date":"2007-09-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Recent work on imperial Britain has highlighted the themes of agrarianism and agricultural improvement, however such work has often neglected the specifics of how eighteenth-century Scottish thought conceptualised property within a stadial sequence with agriculture at the heart of both stadial progression and understandings of the divide between conceptions of savagery and civilisation. This paper will focus on the linkages between thinking about property and agricultural land use within the work of various Scottish thinkers; and in turn to the use of their thought in relation to perceptions of indigenous land and property in early colonial Australia . In doing so the paper will point to the existence of a particular agrarian discourse within both Scottish stadial theory and the broader imperial sphere.","bibo:AuthorList":["McCarthy, Kate"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Stimuli consisted of the movement of a bird against a stationary background or the movement of the background behind a stationary bird. In Experiment 1, pigeons were trained to discriminate either leftward or rightward motion of either the bird or the background from stationary frames drawn from the same movies. The background-discrimination group acquired the discrimination faster than the bird-discrimination group. In Experiment 2, transfer of the discrimination from the task of Experiment 1 to a discrimination between motion directions was examined. Most of the pigeons learned this discrimination rapidly, whereas in a pilot study in which direction discrimination was trained without previous static/movement discrimination, learning was poor. It appears that an experimental history of movement against stationary discrimination promoted the pigeons\u0027 learning of the directional motion discrimination.","bibo:AuthorList":["Goto, Kazuhiro","Lea, Stephen E G"],"dc:date":"2003-07","doi":"10.1901/jeab.2003.80-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4895792,"sim:weight":0.359108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Attention is given to childhood experiences in a hostile environment and how this initiated a quest for a hyper-muscular body. Having successfully achieved this aim by winning a British Championship a turning point moment prematurely terminates his sporting career. The aftermath of this moment for his sense of self are examined by focusing on experiences of the following: negative pain, an atrophying body, the loss of a disciplined body and an athletic identity, and becoming ‘black again’ in a small body. Finally, some reflections on the muscled self and its aftermath are provided.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sparkes, Andrew C.","Batey, Joanne","Brown, David"],"dc:date":"2005","doi":"10.1191/0967550705ab033oa","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These \u0027reactive sulphur species\u0027 are themselves strong oxidizing agents that preferably attack the thiol functionality. We now show that under conditions where disulphides show little effect, disulphide S-oxides rapidly modify metallothionein, alcohol and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenases and a zinc finger-protein fragment in vitro. The known antioxidants ascorbate, NADH, trolox and melatonin are unable to inhibit this oxidation pathway and only an excess of the cellular redox-buffer glutathione quenches the disulphide S-oxide activity. These results suggest that, under conditions of oxidative stress, despite the presence of high concentrations of antioxidants, reactive sulphur species formation may occur and inhibit the function of thiol-dependent proteins. Such a characterization of the disulphide S-oxide-oxidation pathway might also account for some previously observed anomalies in protein oxidation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Giles, Gregory I","Tasker, Karen M","Collins, Catriona","Giles, Niroshini M","O\u0027rourke, Elizabeth","Jacob, Claus"],"dc:date":"2002-06-01","doi":"10.1042/BJ20011882","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Through an empirical treatment of the development of the colonial school system, based largely on archival research, the study pursues two main contentions. The first is that the Belgian colonial authorities played a far more direct role in formulating and implementing education policy than is often believed. The second is that the state authorities’ interest in education was defined both by the economic imperative of colonial exploitation, which compelled them to train skilled workers, and the fear that access to education would fuel potential sedition. Six thematic chapters demonstrate that this paradox of necessity and fear shaped Belgian education policy in the Congo, looking at the reasons behind the fear of potential unrest, and at its ramifications. This thesis argues that these pressures caused the Belgian colonial authorities to try to mould Congolese society using education as a tool, by using specific streams of instruction to inculcate certain groups of Congolese, such as auxiliaries, healthcare workers, and women, with the principles of colonial rule. The thesis also considers how these policies were put into practice, focusing on relations between the colonial authorities and the Catholic and Protestant mission societies, and evaluates their efficacy. Moreover, this thesis attempts to establish, where possible, the reactions of colonized Congolese to European educational provision. Having analysed these issues, this thesis concludes that the colonial education system in the Congo during the interwar years failed to fulfil its main purpose and perpetuate Belgian colonial rule.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dunkerley, Marie Elizabeth","Thomas, Martin"],"dc:date":"2009-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Using a responsive / constructivist methodology my research focuses on an in-service context and takes the participants as the starting point of the research in order to examine both the processes of teacher learning (i.e. how do teachers learn) as well as the product (what are their claims, concerns and issues) regarding the training programme. The emergent data is analysed with findings grounded in the literature of teacher learning and parallels made with my own reflections on the processes of learning through the research experience itself.\n\nThe evaluation focuses on a Cambridge In Service Certificate of English Language Teaching (ICELT) training course which is designed as an internationally appropriate INSET programme that can satisfy the training needs of (both native and non-native) EFL teachers.\n\nThe research is valuable because we do not know how teachers learn on a training course. Through a review of the literature and exploiting the imagery of a metaphorical journey of development, I formulate a framework for analysing teacher learning which distinguishes between practical (applied) knowledge, conceptual knowledge and knowledge of self. This theoretical framework provides a lens to analyse data emerging during the evaluation.\n\nThe research advocates an alternative ‘constructivist – responsive’ method of evaluation for teacher education programmes that has the dual aim of learning through the evaluation (process) as well as from the evaluation (product). The research methods follow a Fourth Generation Evaluation model (Guba and Lincoln 1979). \n\nThe results show that in terms of the evaluation outcomes (product) we can identify modes of learning that concern tasks (how), knowing (what) and awareness of self and socio-cultural context (why). Analysis of the teachers’ talk as collaborative interaction showed little evidence of learning taking place. There were no obvious sections of exploratory talk that is conducive to the construction of new meanings and learning. However by analysing teachers’ talk as a manifestation of individual modes of thinking we are able to identify modes of thinking that have clear parallels with the framework of teacher learning depicted above: techno-rationale thought (how), reflective thought (what) and critical thought (why).The descriptive framework therefore depicts the integration of levels for both the process of learning and the products of learning and as such is a powerful tool for teacher educators. Teachers need to operate on all three levels in their professional lives.\n\nThe study challenges some well-established assumptions in teacher training evaluation. In terms of epistemology, teacher learning is life-long and individual. Human learning occurs on three levels: physical (body), mental (mind) and spiritual (soul) and these levels describe how we think as well as what we do. Evaluation of any training course needs to take into consideration the dimensions of learning, the influence of the socio-cultural context and recognise the interconnectedness of process and product (i.e. how the traveling and the journey interact).","bibo:AuthorList":["Godfrey, James Thompson","MacDonald, Malcolm","Cadorath, Jill"],"dc:date":"2009-08-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In the literary domain her story was appropriated under Elizabeth I and James I by poets and playwrights who included James Aske, Edmund Spenser, Ben Jonson, William Shakespeare, A. Gent and John Fletcher.  As a political, religious and military figure in the middle of the first century AD this Celtic and regional queen of Norfolk is placed at the beginning of British history.  In a gesture of revenge and despair she had united a great number of British tribes and opposed the Roman Empire in a tragic effort to obtain liberty for her family and her people.  \nFocusing on both the literary and non-literary texts I aim to show how the frequent manipulation and circulation of Boudica\u0027s story in the early modern period contributed to the polemical expression and development of English and British national identities, imperial aspirations and gender politics which continue even today.  I demonstrate how such heated debate led to the emergence of a polyvalent national icon, that of Boadicea, Celtic warrior of the British Empire, religious figurehead, mother to the nation and ardent feminist, defending the land, women, the nation and national identity.  \nToday Boudica’s story is that of a foundation myth which has taken its place in national memory alongside Britannia; Boudica’s statue stands outside the Houses of Parliament in London as a testament to Britain’s imperial aspirations under Queen Victoria whilst the maternal statue of her protecting her two young daughters claims a Welsh haven in Cardiff.","bibo:AuthorList":["Frénée-Hutchins, Samantha","Schwyzer, Philip","Pughe, Tom"],"dc:date":"2009-07-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

I analyzed problems created by large public sector employment by using two different frameworks and I made an empirical study about the social factors related to gender issues.\nIn the second chapter, the government\u0027s excess employment in the economy is placed under the efficiency wage framework. It is aimed to find out how the wage and effort differentials between public and private sectors actually affect the labour market or more specifically equilibrium levels of employment, wages and productivity. The chapter investigates how the total welfare responds to changes in these differentials in terms of two different models. The results show that an effort of raising employment by the government eventually leads to a reduction in the total welfare by curbing private employment. This chapter contributes to the existing literature by providing a different approach by defining an explicit outside option, namely the government sector, to the efficiency wage theory.\nAnother aspect analyzed is the relation between public sector employment and output growth. In chapter three, I try to establish a link between the government employment and economic growth rate underlying several mechanisms; distortionary taxes, productive government expenditure and productivity link resulting from the interaction of government and private labour markets inspiring from the efficiency wage theory. I endogenize the growth rate by introducing a public sector capital term in government expenditures. The production function in the growth model is constructed such that productivity of private worker decreases when size of public employment increases. I concluded that the abundant government employment force private sector either to pay higher wages or to have lower productivity of labour as outside option for the workers are now plenty. While higher wage leads more unemployment, productivity decline causes output to reduce.\nDeveloping countries social dynamics have unforeseen consequences on the labour markets. Thus, in order to understand the social and traditional values explaining the employment decisions taken by the labour force in the developing countries, in the fourth chapter of this thesis an empirical study is carried out to investigate the existence of and the potential behavioral change in son preference in Turkey, by using different statistical techniques. The main contribution of this part is that, it provides a broad analysis of son preference behavior in Turkey by using the latest econometric techniques. In particular, it investigates whether the process of urbanization and modernization in Turkey had an effect on son preference behavior over time. The results imply that there is clear and strong son preference in Turkey and the difference between progression ratios of families with and without sons is larger in 1993 compared to 1998. It is also found that the regional effects are more dominant on childbearing decision and urbanization had a diminishing effect on son preference behavior in Turkey.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yavuz, Ayse Arzu","Myles, Gareth Donald"],"dc:date":"2009-09-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Looking down the microscope, the stained chromosomes are concrete countable entities and lend themselves easily to genetic determinism.  As the chromosome composition of a person is generally fixed at the time of conception, when a Y- or X-bearing sperm is united with the X-bearing egg, a person’s genetic sex is taken as permanent and unchanging throughout their life.  Drawing upon gender theory as well as science and technology studies this thesis explores how our particular construction of the concept of ‘genetic sex’ relies on four features of biological sex (binary, fixed, spanning nature, and found throughout the body) and in addition proposes one unique feature, inheritance.   \n\n\nThe empirical research is based on an analysis of popular science books as well as two case studies of how genes relate to sex determination and development.  The analysis of the metaphors used in these books and journal articles reveals how now, with genomic efforts to explore gene expression profiles, there is a shift away from seeing genes as having ‘responsibilities’ for determining phenotypes towards seeing them play a role along with other genes in genetic cascades where other factors such as timing can be incorporated.  The analysis of genomic features such as imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation also provide evidence that such a change should be recognised.  Rather than seeing sex in terms of fixed and static differences and similarities, current research offers new ways of conceptualising similarities and differences as dynamic and responsive to environment.  This supports wider understandings of ‘biology’ as relying on the interactions between genetic processes, cellular environment, and tissue environment – in which the social physicality of bodies is important in forming and maintaining a person’s biology and genetic processes.  Yet as the historical analysis of the shift between the one sex to two sex model indicates, it remains to be seen whether the social sphere will respond by incorporating this new evidence into the tacit, everyday understandings of sex or seek to maintain the binary and fixed relationship(s) between men and women by governing them as males and females.","bibo:AuthorList":["Holme, Ingrid","Dupre, John"],"dc:date":"2007-07-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is therefore important to understand and model the write, read and erase processes of this new technology, so that likely performance limits can be predicted and recording media and recording systems designed. Thus, this thesis presents a theoretical framework and associated computational model for write, read, and erase processes in electrical probe storage on phase change materials (Ge2Sb2Te5).\n\nInvestigations of the write performance in this thesis are mainly focused on writing crystalline bits in an amorphous background, which is investigated using a parametric approach to assess the role of the electrical, thermal, and thickness properties of the media stack and probe tip on the size and shape of recorded bits, and on the write voltage and power required. In addition, advanced modeling techniques including heterogeneous nucleation, threshold switching, contact resistance and surface roughness are also introduced into the writing simulation in order to mimic more closely a practical recording environment. Based on these investigations, the design of an optimal media stack is proposed, which comprises a thin Ge2Sb2Te5 layer sandwiched by a thin capping layer with fairly high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity and a thick underlayer with a high electrical conductivity and fairly low thermal conductivity. \n\nReadout performance is evaluated in this thesis by extending the previous 2-D model to 3D, aiming to pursue a realistic read current and understand effects of the noise on the read process.   It is found that isolated crystalline bits extending through the amorphous matrix exhibits a better reading contrast than either crystalline bits embedded in the amorphous matrix or amorphous bits on top portion of the crystalline matrix. Isolated amorphous bits on the crystalline matrix give the narrowest read pulse width, the largest peak-peak readout signal, and the least noise effect, but the writing of amorphous bits is difficult due to the high field and temperature in the capping/underlayer.\n\nThis thesis also investigated the erasure of both crystalline bits and amorphous bits in a scanning probe phase change memory. The amorphous bit in a crystalline matrix can be easily erased (re-crystallized), but the erasing of crystalline bits in an amorphous matrix is problematic and always accompanied by the formation of an unwanted crystalline ‘ring’ surrounding the originally recorded bit. Two novel approaches, i.e. patterned Ge2Sb2Te5 media in an SiO2 matrix and slow ‘growth’ material are proposed in order to overcome such a ‘ring’ effect. It was found that patterned Ge2Sb2Te5 media can entirely remove the ‘ring’, but the thermal conductivity of the capping/underlayer needs to be chosen carefully to avoid high temperature appearing in these two layers. The fabrication of such patterned media on the nanoscale dimensions needed for ultra-high density storage is however problematic. The use of ‘slow-growth’ material improves the erase performance of continuous (i.e. unpatterned) Ge2Sb2Te5 films, but without a complete removal of the ‘ring’.\n\nFinally, using the optimized design of media stack and a suitable probe tip the feasibility of writing and reading at an areal density of 10Tbit/inch2 has been demonstrated, with a much lower power/energy (1.08pJ/bit) than in any previous work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, Lei","Wright, David"],"dc:date":"2009-10-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The potential association between bone marrow oedema and prognosis in pathologies such as osteoarthritis is becoming increasingly recognised through clinical studies. A limited number of clinical studies have linked bone marrow oedema to altered bone density or altered bone marrow perfusion. The principal aims of this study were to investigate these findings in vitro, using the equine forelimb. \n\nThe presence of bone marrow oedema within the equine forelimb was initially confirmed by undertaking magnetic resonance imaging scans. Bone samples were selected from 10 animals, 5 exhibiting the presence of bone marrow oedema-type abnormalities (BMOA) at the distal metacarpal. Raman microspectroscopy was used to determine the chemical composition of bone and projection radiography to provide a measure of bone density. Micro computed x-ray tomography was undertaken on a subset of three bone samples exhibiting BMOA. A second component of the study utilised contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to enable comparison of perfusion to bone marrow with and without evidence of oedema. A saline flushing agent containing Evan’s blue was used so that subsequent sectioning of the bone would enable visualisation of the distribution of contrast agent as part of a histological examination of the oedematous region.\n\nAn initial observation was that the majority of bone marrow oedema that was observed in the distal metacarpal appeared in a consistent location, namely the postero-inferior aspect of the bone, corresponding to the point of greatest load thereby suggesting a potential relationship to forces upon the joint. The principal observations were that there appears to be increased bone volume densities in those bone samples with evidence of bone marrow oedema. The Raman microspectroscopy did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences in the chemical composition of bone. Hence the overall impression is that bone marrow oedema is associated with a greater volume of bone, although of similar maturity and composition. There was limited evidence of increased perfusion (suggestive of increased vascularity and / or hyperpermeability) in those samples with bone marrow oedema.\n\nThis work suggests that these particular bone marrow oedema lesions are associated with bone changes and potentially vascular changes although the aetiology is currently unclear. Further work is needed to determine the clinical significance and prognosis associated with these particular lesions, and whether these findings can be replicated for bone marrow oedema demonstrated at other anatomical locations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heales, Christine Jane","Knapp, Karen M","Summers, Ian R","Winlove, C Peter"],"dc:date":"2009-04-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A Critical Examination of Shopping as a Gendered Activity","bibo:abstract":"This thesis aims to investigate whether shopping is still a gendered activity in the 21st century. Past research in a number of social science disciplines with a focus on consumer affairs indicated that traditionally shopping was part of the woman’s domain and therefore it was seen as an activity only women engaged in. More current research has however suggested that shopping is no longer just a female activity, and asked for more research to be conducted into both male and female consumer behaviour. The present thesis focuses on recreational shopping and attempts to address the issue of male and female consumer behaviour by means of a multi-method approach. Chapter 1 summarises the background literature and provides the rationale for the research conducted in this thesis. Chapter 2 focuses on the methodological issues relating to the present studies provides a justification of each methodological approach used. Chapters 3 to 6 present the empirical work carried out for this thesis and Chapter 7 presents the conclusions drawn from the research carried out. \nIn Chapter 3 we present an investigation of participants’ (27 men and 71 women) written accounts of past (good and bad) and ideal shopping experiences using thematic analysis. The findings show that women report higher overall shopping enjoyment than men, which is in agreement with previous research results. However, men and women describe similar obstacles and negative experiences that deter them from participating or wanting to participate in shopping activities, and they exhibit similar motivations when thinking about shopping. In contrast, all descriptions of ideal shopping experiences were highly idiosyncratic. \nThe study presented in Chapter 4 explores the relationship between product involvement and shopping enjoyment. One hundred and seventy-four participants (69 men and 102 women) responded to an online questionnaire, which measured attitudes towards shopping in general and shopping in a high involvement situation. As in the previous study, the results showed that overall women reported much higher general shopping enjoyment than men. But when product involvement was high men reported a more positive attitude toward shopping than when just rating shopping in general. This suggests that the issue of gender differences in shopping enjoyment needed to be investigated further and that a more fine-grained approach to research in this area was required to explore the differences and similarities in the way that men and women approach this activity. \nIn Chapter 5 we investigate potential differences and similarities in men and women’s conceptions of shopping. The first study in this chapter asked participants to list types of shopping or shopping activities as they came to mind and the second study utilised a free-sort task. Surprisingly, the results from the Chi-Square analysis of Study 3 and EXTREE and INDSCAL analysis of Study 4 showed that there are very few significant differences in how men and women view shopping. Thus, it seems both sexes appear to think about shopping in very similar (if not the same) ways.  \nIn order to address this question in more depth, the study presented in Chapter 6 took a different methodological approach. Here, a focus group study was carried out to explore what lies behind men and women’s conceptions of shopping. Three groups (N\u003d19) of first year undergraduate students participated in focus groups and discussed what they thought and felt about shopping. Results showed that perceptions of what shopping is are very strong even amongst this group of young consumers. Finally, the results are reviewed in Chapter 7 together with their implications, limitations of the present research and possible future directions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hoeger, Ivonne","Burgoyne, Carole","Schroeder, Jonathan"],"dc:date":"2009-11-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However the Christian population of this land is relatively insignificant today, despite the continuing institutional legacy that the 19th century Western missionary focus on the region created. Palestinian Christians are often forced to employ politically astute as well as theologically radical means in their efforts to appear relevant within an increasingly Islamist-oriented society. My thesis focuses on two ecumenical Christian organisations within Palestine, the Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Centre in Jerusalem (headed by the Anglican cleric Naim Stifan Ateek) and Dar Annadwa Addawliyya (the International Centre of Bethlehem-ICB, directed by the Lutheran theologian Mitri Raheb). Based on my field work (consisting of an in-depth  familiarisation with the two organisations in Palestine and interviews with their directors, office-staff and supporters worldwide, as well as data analyses based on an extensive literature review), I argue that the grassroots-oriented educational, humanitarian, cultural and contextual theological approach favoured by the ICB in Bethlehem is more relevant to the Palestinian situation, than the more sectarian and Western-oriented approach of the Sabeel Centre. These two groups are analysed primarily according to their theological-political approaches. One, (Sabeel), has sought to develop a critical Christian response to the Palestine-Israel conflict using the politico-theological tool of liberation theology, albeit with a strongly ecumenical Western-oriented focus, while the other (ICB), insists that its theological orientation draws primarily from the Levantine Christian (and in their particular case, the Palestinian Lutheran) context in which Christians in Israel-Palestine are placed. Raheb of the ICB has tried to develop a contextual theology that seeks to root the political and cultural development of the Palestinian people within their own Eastern Christian context and in light of their peculiarly restricted life under an Israeli occupation regime of over 40 years. In the process, I argue that the ICB has sought to be much more situationally relevant to the needs of the Palestinian people in the West Bank, given the employment, socio-cultural and humanitarian-health opportunities opened up by the practical-institution building efforts of this organisation in Bethlehem.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kuruvilla, Samuel Jacob","Gorringe, Timothy Jervis"],"dc:date":"2009-04-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Therefore, in view of the resurgence of scholarly interest in ancient magic in the last few decades, it is curious that there is to date no comprehensive treatment of the subject of the frequent connection of many Roman emperors with magicians and magical practices in ancient literature.\n\tThe aim of the present study is to explore the association of Roman emperors with magic and magicians, as presented in our sources. This study explores the twofold nature of this association, namely whether certain emperors are represented as magicians themselves and employers of magicians or whether they are represented as victims and persecutors of magic; furthermore, it attempts to explore the implications of such associations in respect of the nature and the motivations of our sources.  The case studies of emperors are limited to the period from the establishment of the Principate up to the end of the Severan dynasty, culminating in the short reign of Elagabalus. The late Republican background of magic will also be explored as an introduction, since it is important to the understanding of the connection of emperors and magic in our imperial sources.","bibo:AuthorList":["Andrikopoulos, Georgios","Ogden, Daniel"],"dc:date":"2009-08-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":109068,"sim:weight":0.264364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109096,"sim:weight":0.251459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109144,"sim:weight":0.232234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86149,"sim:weight":0.203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109118,"sim:weight":0.196255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108502,"sim:weight":0.194497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176844,"sim:weight":0.173483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85842,"sim:weight":0.172362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108679,"sim:weight":0.172278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85349,"sim:weight":0.164613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108216,"sim:weight":0.154889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108119,"sim:weight":0.149803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108780,"sim:weight":0.149396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109149,"sim:weight":0.14362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84910,"sim:weight":0.143614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108162,"sim:weight":0.137231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.123451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Likewise, few studies of the EU’s democracy promotion and Mediterranean policies have provided any in-depth analysis of Tunisia. Meanwhile, much has been made by scholars of role played by democracy promotion in the EU’s foreign policy, particularly focusing on understandings of the Union as a ‘normative power’ or as an advocate of the ‘democratic peace theory’. By assessing EU democracy promotion in Tunisia, this thesis argues that democracy promotion has become a predominantly functional part of this foreign policy; its principal role being a means of realising the Union’s principal objectives of achieving security and stability for Europeans. By analysing the discourse of actors involved with the EU’s democracy promotion, the thesis traces a shift in EU policy from a more normative position in the mid-1990s to a more realist and securitised one since the turn of the twenty-first century.\nTunisia has evolved over the last two centuries as a state strongly committed to European-influenced socio-economic reforms, but reforms which have led to little political contestability and few changes in government. However, as the EU forged a new approach to its Mediterranean neighbours, it established the promotion of democracy in its neighbours as an integral part of its foreign and security policies. Democracy was to be promoted in Tunisia within multilateral and holistic policy frameworks, such as the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, and by a range of methods that encourage reform of many levels of the region’s societies. Yet it appears that these reforms are failing to deliver the political reforms they once promised. Furthermore, democracy is gradually slipping off the EU’s agenda, and its policy objectives converge with those of the Tunisian government as security concerns come to dominate its policy discourses. In the Tunisian context at least, democracy is a purely utilitarian device used to achieve security. When that security already exists, democracy loses its utility, and fades from its once prominent place in the EU policy in Tunisia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Powel, Brieg Tomos","Sadiki, Larbi"],"dc:date":"2008-07-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Course descriptions (CDs) are routinely produced and used in many educational institutions. However, with the exception of few passing references to them in Elliot (1997) and Swales (1990), discourse analysis has not sought to provide good understanding. This study is an attempt to fill in such a gap in knowledge by exploring the CD in the context of higher education in the United Arab Emirates, where the researcher has been working up to the completion of the present study.\nEmploying the technique of triangulation, the study forms a methodology that combines Foucault’s approach to discourse, action research and the critical and interpretative paradigms as a basis for analyzing data from 12 CDs, questionnaires and interviews. On the level of analysis, Foucault’s approach to discourse has been operationalized by Systemic Functional Linguistics and Bernstein’s theory of pedagogic discourse. Within the framework of the Systemic Functional Linguistics, the CD as a text is approached from three perspectives: Field, Tenor and Mode. This has revealed the overwhelming use of long clauses, the constitution of the student as’expected to study‘, not as thinking or knowing entity, the use of the Declarative Mood, ambiguity of the source and receiver, ellipsis and obligatory sections.\nThe purpose of investigating the CD within the framework of Bernstein’s theory of pedagogic discourse was to shed light on CD perspectives that could not be accounted for by the text analysis on its own. Thus, it described the roles, production, transmission and reproduction processes of the CD and the attitudes of teachers and students towards it. Thus, it has been concluded that the CD is dominantly regulative, that it is imposed by the Accreditation Committee under the pressure of globalization and that its use needs to be improved or stopped.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ould Hende, EL Moctar","MacDonald, Malcolm"],"dc:date":"2009-03-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The thesis examines the ways in which\nthe French reception of Mansfield has idealised her persona to the extent of crafting a\nhagiography. I ask: what were the motives behind the French critics’ desire to put\nMansfield on a pedestal? How did the three years she spent on French soil influence her\nwriting? How do the translations of her work collude in the myth surrounding her\npersonality? Although several other scholars have discussed the Katherine Mansfield\nmyth in France, this thesis is the first sustained attempt to establish interconnections\nbetween her own French influences (literary and otherwise), and the mythmaking\nof\nthe French critics and translators.\nI have divided my thesis into six chapters. The first places Mansfield in the\ngeneral literary context of her era, exploring French literary tendencies at the time and\njuxtaposing them with the main literary trends in England. The second chapter focuses\non the writer’s trips to France, demonstrating the influence of the French experience on\nher life and works.

In the fourth, I explain the workings\nof the writer’s narrative art, so that when in the next chapter I study the translations via\nclose textual analysis, it will become clear whether the beliefs and principles expressed\nin the original texts have been diluted during the translation process. The last chapter\nprior to the conclusion will follow the critical appraisal of her life and work in France\nfrom her death up to the present day, by closely analysing the differing French critical\nresponses.

The purpose of this research was to better understand reflective practice in teacher education.  Dewey (1933), Schön (1983, 1987) and van Manen’s (1977) theories on reflective practice guided this study.  A symbolic interaction theoretical and methodological framework (Denzin, 1978; Prus, 1996) was applied.  \nThe data were collected from teacher interviews, reflection journals and classroom observations.  Five specific themes emerged from the data and were categorised within the symbolic interaction social processes of (1) acquiring perspectives, (2) achieving individuality, (3) experiencing relationships, (4) situating the act, and (5) the act of reflection (Prus, 1996).  In addition, eleven sub-themes were derived from the data which illuminated how the teachers interpreted and practised reflection.  The sub-themes included: (1) defining reflection, (2) questioning as reflection, (3) opportunities for reflection, (4) defining reflection from self / significant others, (5) looking back on action, (6) reflection is based on personal beliefs and educational theory, (7) encountering peers / cooperating teachers, (8) self-reflections, (9) verbal reflections, (10) written reflections, and (11) content of reflection.\nThe findings revealed that teachers possessed a general understanding of reflection and practised technical and interpretive levels of reflection in different contexts.  Engaging in reflective practice activities encouraged the teachers to question their own beliefs and theories.  The study provided evidence showing that reflection is a key element of teacher development.  Reflective thinking is a vehicle that can help teachers to progress from a level where they are mainly guided by intuition to a level where their actions are guided by reflection and self-inquiry.  The study has implications for the ways in which teachers learn about reflection, and I do hope that teacher educators will find it useful.","bibo:AuthorList":["Constantinou, Helen","Troudi, Salah"],"dc:date":"2009-04-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Feedback can informally be described like this: when a speaker\nperforms a linguistic action which requires a linguistic response from a receiver, the given response\nhas an important function for the speaker. In the ideal case, the listener’s response gives information to\nthe speaker that the listener has perceived and understood the communicated content. However, the\nreceiver can also signal that he/she has failed to hear or understand what has been said. As well as that,\nthe receiver can ignore the speaker’s action and initiate other actions or get involved in a different\nconversation. It has been noted, in particular, that if a speaker performs an action that requires a\nresponse, it is less certain whether both the speaker’s performance and the receiver’s responses will\nsucceed. When a receiver does not give a coherent or clear response, then the sender sees that the\nreceiver is experiencing some problem(s) that deserves to be dealt with. For this reason, there might be\nseveral alternatives which the sender can initiate, e.g., to abandon the attempt to get the listener\u0027s\nfeedback, to misinterpret the answer, or to take the listener\u0027s response into account.\nBy increasing awareness of the significance of feedback, we may hope to understand better problems\nin communication between cultures. The present study focuses on verbal feedback actions and\ndiscusses briefly non-verbal feedback actions.\nThe following aspects are central in the study:\nI) Feedback expressions in spoken Arabic:\n- Feedback turns and non-feedback turns. This subsection will include the following items:\nfeedback consisting of a one-word utterance, complex feedback consisting of an utterance of\nmore than one word, eliciting feedback, giving and eliciting feedback, self-feedback and nonfeedback\nturns\nII) The semantic and pragmatic analysis of feedback actions:\n- Criteria for deciding the function of feedback\nIII) Studies of six kinds of conversation and one form of communication, which give examples of\nfeedback in spoken Arabic.\nThis thesis deals also with sociolinguistic feedback and sociolinguistic variations will be described for\neach individual in conversation. These variations will be described with the help of tables and several\nselected examples from the data. These examples have to be connected with the main topic (feedback)\nand related to each social variant.\nA number of theoretical assumptions about FB and related studies which fall under the same\nlinguistic phenomenon i.e., human response, and possibly have universal relevance, are\npresented.

Having gained access to Winston’s Wish, the UK’s leading child bereavement organisation, participant observation was undertaken at three camps for different types of bereavement (accident and illness, suicide, and murder), an Outward Bound weekend specifically for bereaved teenagers, and various social-therapeutic events organised by Winston’s Wish throughout the year. Interviews were conducted with key staff members within the organisation and a documentary analysis of the charity’s literature and media presentations was performed. Utilizing purposeful sampling and following University ethical approval, one boy and one girl from the same family who had recently been bereaved through suicide, and one brother and sister who had recently been bereaved through murder were interviewed. An additional 9 young people (5 females, 4 males) who had been bereaved at least ten years ago were also interviewed. Wolcott’s (1994) ‘description, analysis and interpretation’ approach to transforming qualitative data was adopted, which included a content analysis of all the data generated through observational notes, interview transcripts and reflexive journal entries. From the analysis, six key themes emerged: physical activity, expressing emotion, positive adult relationship(s), area of competence, friendships/social support, and having fun/ humour. These were then represented in the format of a wheel, or the ‘Moving Wheel Model’. This arrangement of themes and the use of the word ‘Moving’ was deliberately chosen to reflect the dynamic and inter-related factors that became prominent at different points in the young people’s bereavement journeys. The main body of this thesis explores these themes in greater depth and offers illustrative examples of how these factors played out in the lives of bereaved children.

In particular, policy initiatives, product developments, innovation and consumption patterns are taken into consideration in order to identify the relationship between the two industries within the context of Cyprus. The airline industry, after the implementation of liberalization, has changed considerably in terms of market size, type of airlines and operations. In the case of destination management, innovation and policy planning are key parameters of success. Additionally, new business production methods are imperative, given the emergence of a ‘new-tourist’ who is educated, seeking shorter breaks and more frequent and cheaper trips in unique and unexplored destinations.\n\nBoth quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis are employed. In particular, 26 interviews of ‘power-elite’ policymakers and stakeholders in Cyprus are used to explore policy implications for the identification of implementation outcomes and their impact on product developments and innovation. Furthermore, 300 self-administered questionnaires were distributed to British travellers to Cyprus, so as to identify the role of the airlines and the extent of the importance attributed to destination.\n\nThe results of the study suggest a gap in the relation of the tourism and airline industries’ interaction at policy level, outcome, and implementation. More specifically, the airline policy enables the industry to become more adaptive and creative, and innovation is depicted via low-cost carriers (LCCs). The tourism industry has developed a policy that reflects the post/neo-Fordism trends of consumption and production, which refers to niche products. However, there is a dearth of policy theory and implementation, with consistent failures and delays. Thus, tourism is at the stage of renovation without essential innovation in contrast to the airline industry, which is a leader, and a proponent of innovation. \n\nIn terms of consumption, Factor Analysis suggests that British tourists tend to book their holiday trips based on three categories of airline attributes: ‘Customer service’, ‘Price-sensitive \u0026 Internet’ and ‘Selection in travel behaviour’. Cluster analysis suggests three main categories of tourists, namely, ‘Traditional’, ‘Demanding/Opportunists’ and ‘Ambivalent’. The results confirm that consumers have changed and tourism destinations must be able to adapt to their demands and to offer a variety of services and products in order to survive in a competitive global market. In the case of the airline industry and holiday trips, convenience and the airport that the airline is flying from is more important than the cost of the ticket.","bibo:AuthorList":["Liasidou , Sotiroula","Professor Tim Coles, Professor Gareth Shaw"],"dc:date":"2009-02-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4897698,"sim:weight":0.288325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The accuracy of these timescales, and therefore our ability to confidently\nreject a given model, rely on the accuracy of the derived ages for star-forming-regions (SFRs). In\nthis study I have developed the new techniques and adopted or updated the existing techniques\nnecessary to derive precise age orders for a range of SFRs.\nDeriving precise ages for SFRs requires precise distances and extinctions. I have applied a\nnew technique,  2 fitting (Naylor \u0026Je ries, 2006), to derive a set of self-consistent and statistically\nrobust distances (and mean extinctions), with associated uncertainties for 12 SFRs. I have also\nrevised and formalised a widely used method of deriving individual extinctions, the Q-method\n(Johnson \u0026Morgan, 1953). These new data show that the largest remaining uncertainty in deriving\ndistances to SFRs is composition.\nDeriving ages or age orders for pre-main-sequence (pre-MS) populations using pre-MS\ntheoretical isochrones has been shown to be unreliable at present (Naylor et al., 2002; Bonatto\net al., 2004; Pinsonneault et al., 2004), largely due to model dependencies and spreads within a\ncolour-magnitude diagram (CMD). Therefore, I have developed a technique to model the pre-MS,\ngenerating empirical isochrones, which e ectively removes spreads in pre-MS populations in a\nCMD.\nThe derived distances and extinctions have been applied to the empirical isochrones, enabling\nthe creation of an age ordered ladder in intrinsic colour and absolute magnitude. This\nhas been calibrated using ages for fiducial sequences and nominal ages assigned to the separable\ngroups, which are as follows:\n  1 Myr, NGC2244 and IC5146.\n  2 Myrs, NGC6530 and the ONC.\n  3 Myrs,   Ori, Cep OB3b, NGC2264 and   Ori.\n  4 5 Myrs, NGC2362 and IC348.\n  10 Myrs, NGC7160.\n  13 Myrs, h and   Per.\n  20 Myrs, NGC1960.\n  40 Myrs, NGC2547.\n2\nOnce assigned the nominal ages and age orders were combined with ancillary data to investigate\nrotation rate and disc evolution. The general trends of rotation rate distribution evolution\nand disc fraction changes with age confirmed existing estimates for the disc survival, and therefore\nstar-disc interaction through disc-locking, with a timescale of   5 Myrs. However, this study\nalso revealed some of the first evidence of local environment e ects. IC348 appears ‘out of sequence’\nin both the rotation rate distribution and disc fraction. Specifically, IC348 has a larger disc\nfraction than expected at its nominal age and exhibits a rotation rate distribution expected from a\nmuch younger SFR (i.e. the ONC). This could be a consequence of the lower number density of\nO stars (none exist in IC348) and therefore a lower density of UV flux, which acts to hasten disc\ndissipation.\nFinally, a potentially important feature of stellar populations in a CMD, the R-C gap was\nidentified. This separation in a CMD of the fully convective pre-MS and main-sequence (MS) stars\nwith radiative cores was found to vary as a function of age. As the R-C gap is also measurable in\ncolour it provides a distance independent age indicator. I have explained the underlying physics\nof the R-C gap and discussed possible applications of this phase change of the stellar interior.\nIn addition, an overlap between the pre-MS and MS sections of the R-C gap was apparent in all\nSFRs where the R-C gap could be unambiguously identified. This R-C gap overlap shows that\nthe studied SFRs must contain a spread in isochronal ages. However, the interpretation of this\nspread is dependent on the underlying assumptions. If one assumes stars form by a robust slowstar-\nformation (SSF) mechanism and isochronal ages represent the true age of a star, then these\nspreads can be construed as true age spreads. Alternatively, if one adopts a rapid-star-formation\nmodel (RSF), this spread can be explained as a variation in accretion histories of the constituent\nstars. As found by Siess et al. (1999) and Tout et al. (1999) accretion can act to accelerate pre-MS\nstar evolution, meaning the isochronal age does not represent the true age of the star. This increases\nthe advantages of empirical isochrones and age ordering over the derivation of individual ages for\nSFRs. Indeed, this R-C gap overlap could be used to ‘normalise out’ any spread in age or accretion\nhistory and therefore increase the power of derived age orders.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mayne, Nathan J.","Naylor, Tim"],"dc:date":"2008-06-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is therefore becoming apparent that estuarine sequences may hold an archive of mid-late Holocene climate change information, as well as being recorders of RSL change.\n\nThe principal aim of this study is to produce a palaeosalinity-based climate record for southern England during the late Holocene, based on changes in climate-driven freshwater influx into the estuarine environment. The late Holocene palaeosalinity record of the inner Taw Estuary will be reconstructed using diatom salinity index as a proxy for salinity. Nine periods of below-average or above-average palaeosalinity have been recognised in the Taw Estuary since 300 cal.yr.BC. Four intervals of high river discharge are identified at 520-780, 850-1030, 1215-1315, and 1420-1900 cal.yr.AD. Five intervals of low river discharge are identified at 300-520, 780-850, 1030-1215, 1315-1420, and 1900-2000 cal.yr.AD. This shows that there has been significant climatic variation in southern Britain since c.300 cal.yr.AD, with climatic shifts evident in the estuarine record. In order to validate this record, the fluvial geomorphic history of the lower Taw valley was also investigated. There is a strong correspondence between the dry and wet climatic periods identified in the estuary and the geomorphic fluvial history and flood record of the lower Taw valley. Comparisons with other proxy climate records in the UK and Europe show a high degree of correspondence with the Taw Estuary palaeosalinity-based climate record. \n\nAs the inner estuary environment will also be influenced by RSL change during the late Holocene, RSL change since c.6600 cal.yr.BP was successfully reconstructed in the Taw Estuary, with eleven new validated SLIPs providing evidence of former MSL. The magnitude and rates of RSL rise in north Devon are compared with other RSL records in southern Britain, suggesting that the isostatic history is similar to other areas bordering the Bristol Channel and with the central south coast of England. Fluctuations in palaeosalinity in the late Holocene are seen to be mainly controlled by centennial-scale changes in climate-driven river discharge, rather than RSL change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Havelock, Glenn Michael","Brown, Tony","Caseldine, Chris","Jordan, Jason"],"dc:date":"2009-02-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The tradeoff of banking sector openness between the potential benefit (economic growth) and risk (economic volatility) sparks hot debates. This thesis addresses the question of whether there are sufficient economic reasons to support openness.\n\nBanking sector openness may directly and indirectly affect growth. Chapter II reinvestigates these direct and indirect links, using an advanced econometric technique (GMM dynamic panel estimators). The empirical results confirm the presence of direct and indirect links, and thus provide the backbone for countries planning to open their banking sector to international competition, especially developing countries.\n\nIn Chapter III, we use parametric and non-parametric stochastic frontiers to measure banking sectors’ cost efficiencies, and then use panel data methodology to reinvestigate the empirical relationship between bank efficiency and banking sector openness. Our results suggest the world banking industry becomes increasingly efficient with greater openness.\n\nChapter IV studies the relationship between macroeconomic volatility and banking sector openness. We address several questions: can high levels of volatility be explained by the opening of the banking sector? Are the effects of banking sector openness in developing and developed countries different in a crisis compared with normal times? What is the effect of mis-match between banking sector openness and financial development? We find that the positive relationship between banking sector openness and economic volatility originates from the mismatch between banking sector openness and financial markets development. Banking sector openness in itself eases crisis volatility. \n\nChapter V presents the main conclusions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mao, Zhiren","Maloney, John"],"dc:date":"2009-05-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It first examines the iconography of Seleucus I and argues that as Seleucus became more secure in his rule he began to develop a new iconography that was a blend of Alexander’s and his own. This pattern changed under Antiochus I. He replaced the Zeus of Alexander and of Seleucus with Apollo-on-the-omphalos. At approximately the same time, a dynastic myth of descent from Apollo was created and promulgated. It is argued that in addition to the traditional view that Apollo was readily identifiable to the Greco-Macedonians within the empire he was also accessible to the Babylonians through the god Nabû and to the Persians as a Greek (or Macedonian) version of the reigning king. This ambiguity made Apollo an ideal figure to represent the multi-ethnic ruling house. This also explains the dynasty’s reluctance to deviate from the iconography established by Antiochus I. This thesis continues to explore the role of Apollo and other gods in creating an iconography which represented Seleucid power ending with the reign of Antiochus III. This thesis also incorporates the numismatic representations of the king as divine into the debate on ruler cult. This evidence suggests that the Seleucids may have had some form of ruler cult before the reign of Antiochus III.","bibo:AuthorList":["Erickson, Kyle Glenn","Ogden, Daniel","Mitchell, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2009-12-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

F., Margolin, L. G. and Rider, W. Implicit Large Eddy Simulation. {\\it Cambridge}. 2007]), but it has not previously been examined for two-dimensional flow. This thesis investigates whether ILES can be applied successfully to two-dimensional flow. Modified equation analysis is used to demonstrate the similarities between the truncation errors of certain numerical schemes and the subgrid terms of the barotropic vorticity equation (BVE). This presents a theoretical motivation for the numerical testing. \n\nBurgers equation is first used as a model problem to develop the ideas and methodology. Numerical schemes that are known to model Burgers equation well (shock capturing schemes) are shown to be implicitly capturing the subgrid terms of the one-dimensional inviscid Burgers equation through their truncation errors. \n\nNumerical tests are performed on three equation sets (BVE, Euler equations and the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equation) to assess the application of ILES to two-dimensional flow. The results for each of these equation sets show that the schemes considered for ILES are able to capture some of the subgrid terms through their truncation errors. In terms of accuracy, the ILES schemes are comparable (or outperform) schemes with simple explicit subgrid models when comparing vorticity solutions with a high resolution reference vorticity solution. The results suggest that conservation of vorticity is important to the successful application of ILES to two-dimensional flow, whereas conservation of momentum is not. The schemes considered for ILES are able to successfully model the downscale enstrophy transfer, but none of the schemes considered for ILES (or the schemes with simple subgrid models) can model the correct upscale energy transfer from the subgrid to the resolved scales. \n\nEnergy backscatter models are considered and are used with the ILES schemes. It is shown that it is possible to create an energy conserving and enstrophy dissipating scheme, composed of an ILES scheme and a backscatter model, that improves the accuracy of the vorticity solution (when compared with the corresponding ILES scheme without backscatter).","bibo:AuthorList":["Kent, James","Thuburn, John","Wood, Nigel"],"dc:date":"2009-11-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Fatigue and exercise tolerance have traditionally been explained through peripheral mechanisms, such as excitation-contraction coupling failure and the inability to supply sufficient metabolic substrate to contracting muscle in order to meet increasing energy demand. More recently, models of central control, which are proposed to regulate exercise intensity in an anticipatory/feedforward manner, with the ultimate aim of avoiding physiological ‘catastrophe’, have received a great deal of attention. This thesis investigated several of the key requirements and mechanisms stated in these models. \n\t\nThe central governor model (CGM) and teleoanticipation are stated to use a combination of prior experience and distance knowledge of an exercise bout to work in a feedforward manner, so that a pacing strategy is set before exercise commences which ensures the bout is completed in an optimum time but in the absence of premature fatigue. Study one examined the influence of distance knowledge, prior experience and distance feedback on the setting and regulation of a pacing strategy in 4 km time trial (TT) cycling in trained cyclists (n \u003d 18). When performing 4 × 4 km TT intervals, it was found that prior experience of the exercise (in the absence of distance feedback and distance knowledge) allowed the creation of a pacing strategy that produced a performance which was as competitive as cyclists who were provided with prior experience, distance knowledge and distance feedback. The difference in TT completion time between groups (CON \u003d feedback group, EXP \u003d no feedback group) was reduced with subsequent TT (CON TT1 367 ± 21 s; EXP TT1 409 ± 45 s; CON TT2 373 ± 19 s; EXP TT2 389 ± 30 s; CON TT3 375 ± 18 s; EXP TT3 383 ± 26 s; CON TT4 373 ± 20 s; EXP TT4 373 ± 14 s), so that by the final TT, completion time between groups was almost exactly the same. It was concluded that when sufficient prior experience is attained in the absence of distance knowledge and feedback, a successful pacing strategy can be set.\n\n\tIn order for pacing to be set prior to an exercise bout and adjusted in a feedforward/anticipatory manner during exercise, an internal mechanism must exist which monitors the passage of time. Study two examined the accuracy and robustness of this ‘internal clock’ by assessing cyclist’s (n \u003d 16) ability to gauge the distance they had cycled during repeated 4 km and 6 km TT. The internal clock was shown to be inaccurate to absolute measures of distance, but showed a calibration capacity following experience of a TT of unknown distance (24.6 ± 18.2 % error in distance judged completed vs. 8.2 ± 5.5 % error in distance judged completed). This process was fragile and occurred in the absence of any significant performance improvement. It was concluded that relative quantities appear more important in creating a pacing strategy, and that times are of greater importance than distances.\n\n\tStudy three examined the influence of comparative performance feedback in a field setting in 4 km track TT cycling in trained cyclists (n \u003d 5). Correct feedback produced a significantly faster TT time (t4 \u003d -3.10, p \u003c 0.05) than non-contingent feedback (341 ± 8 s vs. 350 ± 12 s), with differences in mean lap speed apparent between the conditions at the start of the TT (t4 \u003d 4.71, p \u003c 0.05) and at the end of the TT (t4\u003d 3.45, p \u003c 0.05; t4 \u003d 3.30, p \u003c 0.05). The study provided empirical support for the assumption that performance feedback is advantageous during exercise and provided insights into past and present exercise comparison and its role on the setting of a pacing strategy.\n\n\tA central component of the CGM and theories of central exercise regulation is the role of afferent feedback during exercise and the premature termination of exercise before a true maximum intensity has been reached. Study four used acetaminophen to blunt cyclists’ (n \u003d 13) pain response during ten mile (16.1 km) TT in order to disrupt the afferent feedback processes. When using acetaminophen, cyclists produced significantly faster (t12 \u003d 2.55, p \u003c 0.05) TT completion times (1575 ± 96 s) than under a placebo condition (1605 ± 122 s). When using acetaminophen, cyclists had a higher power output during the middle section of the TT (F1, 12 \u003d 4.79, p \u003c 0.05), yet showed no significant difference in RPE (F1,12 \u003d 0.72, p \u003e 0.05) or pain scores (F1,12 \u003d 0.30, p \u003e 0.05). It was concluded that acetaminophen reduced levels of pain during the TT, thereby disrupting the comparative afferent feedback mechanism and allowing cyclists access to a ‘metabolic reserve’.\n\n\tThe research presented has advanced our knowledge and supported propositions of models of central control and regulation during exercise. The research has provided further insight in the role of prior experience, distance knowledge, distance feedback, the internal clock, performance feedback and afferent feedback on the setting and maintenance of a pacing strategy in 4, 6 and 16.1 km TT cycling.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mauger, Alexis R","Williams, Craig Anthony","Jones, Andrew M"],"dc:date":"2009-11-24","doi":"10.1007/s00421-009-1308-y.","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":105152,"sim:weight":0.30067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107342,"sim:weight":0.259593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.189892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.185946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26702,"sim:weight":0.147009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Within the theoretical and methodological framework of discourse analysis this thesis contends that the multiple constructions of Iranian national identity, which coexist and compete with each other, can be better understood as discourses. The detailed analysis of five discourses of national identity illustrates a complex set of relationships based on the meanings attached to Iran’s Islamic and pre-Islamic identities and how the West is dealt with in the construction of national identity. The first discourse addressed is the Islamist discourse of national identity, which prioritises Iran’s Islamic culture. At the opposite end of the spectrum the Iranist discourse, which is based on the prioritisation of Iran’s pre-Islamic culture, is deconstructed. It is contended that this represents a new indigenous Iranism that is based on a rediscovery of Sasanian Iran as opposed to Achaemenid Iran. Khatami’s discourse is presented as an attempt at a dialogue between Islamism and Iranism. It is argued that the Khatami period is unique in terms of the articulation of national identity because Khatami has combined for the first time ideas, which together form the Islamist-Iranian discourse of national identity, as an official state discourse. These are the combination of Islamic and pre-Islamic culture, the notion of ‘dialogue among civilisations’ and the idea of Islamic democracy. While these three discourses are based on the politicisation of culture, two additional discourses are presented that reject this politicisation. The first is a discourse of civic Iranian national identity and the second is a discourse of cosmopolitan Iranian national identity. It is contended that Khatami and his Islamist-Iranian discourse have allowed the more open articulation, since the establishment of the Islamic Republic, of these constructions of Iranian national identity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Holliday, Shabnam","Ansari, Ali"],"dc:date":"2007-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The benefits of physical activity and dangers of a sedentary lifestyle to health outcomes, e.g. cardio-vascular disease, obesity, diabetes and psychological well-being are well documented children. Due to methodological and measurement problems, research addressing the relationship between psychological well-being and physical activity are inconsistent and weak. This series of studies aimed to overcome the problems of previous research and investigated the relationship between children’s psychological well-being and habitual physical activity. Previous research has highlighted an association between children’s physical activity and individual psychological well-being constructs. However, Masse et al. (1998) argued that psychological well-being should contain the measurement of both positive (e.g. self-esteem) and negative (e.g. depression) psychological states. Subsequently, Parfitt and Eston (2005) identified an association between children’s total physical activity and psychological well-being (anxiety, depression, self-esteem). Limitations of previous studies include the type of physical activity measures used and the measurement of only global self-esteem, which itself is multidimensional. The purpose of this research was to extend and expand on the limitations of the Parfitt and Eston’s (2005) study. Psychological measures included both global, domain and sub-domain measurements of self-esteem, with accelerometry providing estimates of total daily physical activity and time spent in sedentary through to vigorous intensity activity. Study One assessed relationships between psychological well-being and physical activity using the same psychological constructs as Parfitt and Eston (2005), but with physical activity intensity included. Results highlighted an association between self-esteem and time spent in very light activity. Study Two assessed the current data’s applicability with the proposed models and theories related to self-esteem. It was concluded that the current data provided an adequate fit with the proposed models and theories of self-esteem. Study Three introduced the domain and sub-domain constructs of self-esteem and a more valid measure of physical activity. Results highlighted associations at the global, domain and sub-domain levels with predominately time spent in very light and vigorous intensity activity. Very light intensity activity was associated with negative effects while vigorous intensity activity was associated with positive effects. It was hypothesised that if these cross-sectional relationships also existed longitudinally, then an intervention study changing the time children spend in very light and vigorous intensity activity may be beneficial to children’s psychological health. With the relationship between children’s psychological well-being and physical activity clearly highlighted, Study Four assessed the direction of this relationship and aimed to inform a potential intervention study. Longitudinal data were collected over a 12-month period and multi-level modelling was used to analyse the direction of the relationship. Results highlighted a potential indirect effect of time accumulated in very light and vigorous intensity activity on psychological well-being, which reinforced the previous cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, a reciprocal effect was identified between physical activity and the physical self-worth domain. It was concluded that interventions decreasing time spent in very light and increasing vigorous intensity activity may be beneficial to children’s psychological well-being. Study Five aimed to have an impact on children’s psychological well-being, by reducing the time children spent in very light intensity activity, through an increase in daily step counts. Although the intervention decreased the time children spent in sedentary behaviour, there was no influence on psychological well-being. However, there were several methodological limitations that affected the intervention, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from this study, including a small sample size providing available data for analysis. The results of this thesis show a relationship between children’s psychological well-being and habitual physical activity intensity exists. Further research manipulating the time children accumulate in very light (reduction) and vigorous (increase) intensity activity, can potentially impact positively on the psychological well-being of a normal population of children.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pavey, Toby George","Parfitt, Gaynor","Rowlands, Ann"],"dc:date":"2009-09-24","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Political elites in both the USA and UK have significantly challenged accepted standards of appropriateness regarding detention, even though these states are traditionally strongly associated with the promotion of human rights internationally. Such defections and contestations present researchers with an intriguing process to understand, as these practices, by definition, challenge our settled assumptions about the post Cold-war international order. This thesis examines one element of this puzzle, assessing how the normative constraints associated with the international detention regime were negotiated by the Blair government and Bush administration so as to allow for contestation and apparent defection in 2001-2006. Generally, the IR literature on norms has focused on their constraining power, considering simple dichotomies of compliance and defection, often drawing on pre-defined interests to explain behaviour. Whilst constructivists have recognised the constitutive nature of norms, they lack a persuasive account of the micro-foundational processes of norm influence which prevents them from engaging with the contestation of seemingly embedded international normative standards. In order to address this problem I draw from the social identity approach in social psychology, where scholars focus on the multiplicity of social identities and the interactive processes of norm influence and contestation at a micro-foundational level. I demonstrate that by firmly embedding individuals in the broader social identities context and focusing on the management strategies employed by political elites we can better understand the nature of normative constraint in these cases, and whether or not an enabling framework for such counter-normative practices was established. This thesis aims to bridge some of the gap that exists between research that focuses on international norms and that which concentrates on state leaders, demonstrating the importance of the broader interactive processes of contestation, generally missing from current constructivist accounts of international norms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anstee, Jodie","Dunne, Tim"],"dc:date":"2008-09-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The notions of text and genre are examined, as are the processes of reading in the first language (L1) and in the foreign language (L2). The question of ‘readability, and that of ‘authenticity’ in L2 are also examined. \n\nIn order to ascertain students’ reactions to different text-types, 150 texts from French sources were gathered and classified. 100-word samples of each text were analysed for various linguistic features. Statistical tests on these were carried out, as well as statistical tests on the visual elements and layout of the whole texts. Further linguistic analysis was carried out within the text-type groups in order to ascertain their grammatical features. 31 students from local tertiary institutions were interviewed, and their perceptions on a sample of the texts were sought. This included the grading of texts for difficulty on a 1-5 Likert scale. \n\nThe results of the interviews were triangulated with the statistical and linguistic analyses. A relationship was found between text-type and level of perceived difficulty.  In the light of these results, the distinction between genre and text-type was examined, and a way was found of linking these into a textual taxonomy, which has close relations with the grammatical and presentational features which characterise the various text-types. In the light of these results, the question of the ‘topic approach’ to the teaching of French is examined, and a way found by which text-types that are perceived to be simpler are studied before those which are perceived to be more difficult. This approach advocates a more logical continuum of grammatical presentation than has hitherto been witnessed in course books for French at this level, while retaining the semantic integrity inherent in the ‘topic approach’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Maun, Ian","Myhill, Professor D.; Neather, Dr. E.J."],"dc:date":"2009-04-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Even as Pater realizes the ‘illusive inscrutable mistakable’ nature of the individual under the conditions of modernity, his aesthetics revolve around it.   \n\nHe boldly attempts to reconsider the kind of individualism that will be possible in the wake of modernity, searching within the chaos and ephemera of a Godless universe to seek Man’s raison d’etre within the imagination.  Certainly, his idiosyncratic thought is not a system, nor even a consistent vision, so much as a faltering meditation on what kind of individualism is possible under the conditions of modernity.  It is a discourse situated at a schism in humankind’s consciousness of itself: on one hand, looking to the philosophies Pater studied carefully -- those of Hume, Kant, Schiller and Goethe, amongst others -- and on the other hand, understanding that the emerging future will require its own conception of reality.  \n\nWith these issues in mind, my study has two main aims.  First, it explores the troubled vicissitudes of Pater’s conception of the individual.  Second, it argues that Pater has a significant position, not only in the history of literary style, but in the history of ideas, by tracing how his thought interacts with and reconceives the philosophical traditions of British empiricism, German Romanticism and Idealism.  Its chapters are organized around six central concerns: the relationship between self and world, the nebulous conceptions of ‘spirit’ and ‘soul,’ sensuality, the body as subject and object, passing time and the eternal moment, and ethics.

Specifically the closed-loop mechanical recycling of composites used heavily in the automotive sector known as dough and sheet moulding composites, DMC and SMC respectively, are investigated. The recycling of glass reinforced thermoset polymer composite materials has been an area of investigation for many years and composites used in the automotive industry are of particular interest due to legislative and social pressures on the industry. \n\nThe mechanical recycling process and then collection of useful fibrous grades of recycled materials, recyclate, by a novel air separation technique were investigated first. The properties of these recyclate fibres were characterised and compared directly with the properties of virgin glass fibres they were to be used to replace. Single fibre tensile tests were employed to compare the strengths of the fibres and single fibre pull-out tests were used to investigate the strength of the interface between the fibres and a polyester matrix. These tests showed the recyclate fibres to be weaker and have a poorer interface with the polyester matrix than the virgin glass fibres. Understanding the properties of the recyclate materials meant their reformulation into new composites could be carefully considered for the production of new high performance materials.\n\nTwo grades of the collected recyclate materials were then reformulated in to new DMC and SMC composites, replacing percentages of the virgin glass fibre reinforcement. The mechanical properties of the resulting manufactured composites were characterised throughout for direct comparison against one another and an unmodified control material, using both three-point flexural tests and Charpy impact tests. Through the modification of existing manufacturing techniques and the development of novel production equipment it has been possible to successfully manufacture both DMC and SMC composites with the recyclate materials used to replace virgin glass fibres. Virgin glass fibres have successfully been replaced by recyclate materials without disrupting standard production techniques and with minimal reduction of the mechanical properties of the resulting composites. As the loadings of recyclate materials used were greatly increased both the flexural and impact strengths were significantly degraded and it was found that chemical modification of the composite could be used to improve these formulations. It has been shown that the recyclate materials should be considered and treated as a distinct reinforcing ingredient, separately from the remaining virgin glass fibres.","bibo:AuthorList":["Palmer, James Alexander Thomas","Ken, Evans","Oana, Ghita"],"dc:date":"2009-06-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Even though young people are an important segment of the tourism industry little research has been done concerning their actual behaviour towards culture and cultural destinations. Given their significance, an examination of their perceptions towards cultural destinations can give useful insights. This can be done both academically, for the enrichment of theory, but also practically, for the appropriate management of cultural sites according to their needs and wants. In this study it was found that young visitors consider culture as one of the most important motives for travelling. According to the respondents, attributes related to monuments/exhibits at the site are more important than the facilities and amenities provided by its managers. The research identified that, overall, young people were fairly satisfied with Delphi, particularly with its beauty and landscape, but less satisfied with the man-made interventions. Importance-satisfaction analysis indicated that issues concerning the organisation and promotion of the site have positive levels of satisfaction, while issues concerning education and quality have comparatively negative levels. Factor Analysis derived three groups of attributes that should be considered for the future planning of the destination: ‘Place and Experience’; ‘Amenities and Quality’; ‘Facilities and Operation’. Finally, Cluster Analysis indicated that there are three main segments of young visitors in Delphi which, according to their profile, develop certain behaviours that should also be taken into account for the future promotion of the site; ‘The Greeks’; ‘The Americans and others’; ‘The French’. Therefore, better management strategies according to the needs and wants of this dynamic market would make the site more attractive, contributing to the promotion of cultural tourism in general. The study found that young people are great ‘consumers’ of culture and seek to enrich their knowledge while visiting cultural destinations. If a cultural destination meets their specific needs and wants, greater levels of satisfaction will be generated. Positive levels of satisfaction will lead to a series of positive consequences: loyalty, mouth to mouth marketing and peer influence. This, in addition to the fact that young people are the tourists of the future, can lead to the creation of consciousness for culture while travelling and to the enhancement of the potential visitation of the site in the following years.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boukas, Nikolaos","Coles, Tim","Shaw, Gareth"],"dc:date":"2008-08-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Due to the complex dynamics of the sea waves’ behaviour, statistical techniques are probably the only viable approach when forecasting over substantial spatial and temporal intervals. However this view changes when limiting the forecasting time to a few seconds or when the goal is to estimate the quiescent periods that occur due to the beating interaction of the wave components, especially in narrow band seas.\nThis work considers the multi disciplinary research field of deterministic sea wave prediction (DSWP), exploring different aspects of DSWP associated with shallow angle LIDAR systems. The main goal of this project is to study and develop techniques to reduce the prediction error. The first part deals with issues related to shallow angle LIDAR systems data problems, while the remaining part of this work concentrates on the prediction system and propagation models regardless of the source of the data.\nThe two main LIDAR data problems addressed in this work are the non-uniform distribution and the shadow region problems. An empirical approach is used to identify the characteristics of shadow regions associated with different wave conditions and different laser position. A new reconstruction method is developed to address the non-uniformed sampling problem, it is shown that including more information about the geometry and the dynamics of the problem improves the reconstruction error considerably.\nThe frequency domain approach to the wave propagation model is examined. The effect of energy leakage on the prediction error is illustrated. Two approaches are explored to reduce this error. First a modification of the simple dispersive phase shifting filter is tested and shown to improve the prediction. The second approach is to reduce the energy leakage with an iterative Window-Expansion method. Significant improvement of the prediction error is achieved using this method in comparison to the End-Matching method typically used in DSWP systems. The final part in examining the frequency domain approach is to define the prediction region boundaries associated with a given prediction accuracy.\nThe second propagation model approach is the Time/Space domain approach. In this method the convolution of the measured data and the propagation filter impulse response is used in the prediction system. In this part of the research work properties of these impulse responses are identified. These are found to be quite complicated representations. The relation between the impulse response (duration and shift) with prediction time and distance are studied. Quantification of these impulse responses properties are obtained by polynomial approximation and non-symmetric filter analysis. A new method is shown to associate the impulse response properties to the prediction region of both the Fixed Time and Fixed Point mode.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abusedra, Lamia","Belmont, Mike"],"dc:date":"2009-02-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":29475,"sim:weight":0.30668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31990,"sim:weight":0.30174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999041,"sim:weight":0.262671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26319,"sim:weight":0.260714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58759,"sim:weight":0.250844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":30418,"sim:weight":0.240336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108986,"sim:weight":0.185083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In the first chapter, I argue that historiographic criticism has largely undermined our belief in a monolithic, objective History, and that modern historical enquiry contains a tacit admission of its own subjectivity. In Chapter Two, I use these admissions to argue the case for history on film, demonstrating that in terms of the construction of history, the processes of filmmaking closely resemble those of ‘doing’ history, and that criticisms of historical films are often the same criticisms which Historians raise in respect of their own works of ‘pure history’. \nIn the remaining chapters (3-6), I look at specific examples of types of historical character, drawn from the medieval separation of society into “those who work, those who fight and those who pray”, as well as “those who rule”. In each case, I adopt a similar methodological approach, conducting close cinematographic analysis on a range of film extracts in order to see how filmmakers have tried to construct the past visually in their representation of historical characters. Here my arguments move away from historical criticism to focus instead on aesthetics and cinematography. \nThe overall theory is that there exist two fundamental approaches to the medieval past in film: the first iconic and syntagmatic, the second paradigmatic. Iconic approaches, I argue, work to try to recreate the lost medieval referent by using aesthetic ‘signifiers’ in order to communicate their significance to a medieval audience. The paradigm, on the other hand, works in the opposite way; in order to explain a medieval object, the filmmaker casts about for modern equivalents to use as metaphors. Where the icon recreates the object to communicate the concept, the paradigm communicates the object by re-presenting the concept.","bibo:AuthorList":["Elliott, Andrew Brian Ross","Canaparo, Claudio","Cayley, Emma"],"dc:date":"2009-07-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The research questions were:\n1.\tWhat is the nature of the cyclonic interactions observed in the transactions of a team of online management educators?\n2.\tHow might an understanding of cyclonic interactions, \na.\thelp refine action research, and,\nb.\tgenerate rich insight for online management education?\n\nThe methodology was an action research project. The research team worked in an online Master of Business Administration (MBA) to continuously develop teaching practice in one unit of the MBA. The methodology matched the objectives of the project, and the appropriate rigour associated with qualitative, interpretive research. The results showed that theories of systems and relational dynamics, adapted to hermeneutics and aligned with other learning theories, can be framed by the metaphor of a cyclone to conduct research into teaching practice and build upon the theory base in the field of online education. \n\nOnline management education is subject to reinterpretations. The cyclonic framework explains some of the changes. The project showed that a chaotic but organised cyclonic program development process in one particular MBA course was informative for and informed by the chaotic and cyclonic globalized business world. For the education of managers the cyclonic view was relevant. The approach was metaphorical and, therefore, opened new ways of seeing and speaking. Findings pertained to the nature of the cyclonic interactions, how an understanding of cyclonic interactions helped to refine action research, and how an understanding of cyclonic interactions helped generate rich insight for online management education. \n\nIt was found that it was the asymmetrical impetus of imperfection that created the examples of cyclonic learning spirals formed as double feedback loops for improved understanding. Online education in the action research required cyclical enhancement of connectedness by teachers, stronger emphasis on relational considerations in learning, and heightened expectations of collaboration by educators. It became possible to correlate earlier conceptions of action research with cyclonic categories and analyse the parallels with events in this action research project. Models were developed and presented to explain cyclonic connections with hermeneutics, collaborative teaching, online resource development, and the environment of online management education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Creed, Andrew Shawn","Dillon, Patrick"],"dc:date":"2009-05-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A Social Constructivist Approach to Embedding Formative Assessment and Evaluation in a Secondary School","bibo:abstract":"The theoretical framework for this empirical study extends a trail of thinking from a social constructivist view of learning to the areas of assessment, evaluation and leadership. The relationship between social constructivist learning principles, formative approaches to assessment and evaluation, and collaborative leadership styles is explored and discussed. Learning and teaching developments in secondary schools have often fragmented the intrinsic elements of learning, teaching, assessment, evaluation and leadership. As Palmer (2007) so aptly puts it: ‘…we think the world apart.’ (p. 64). This study seeks to ‘think education together’ by taking a more integrated perspective.\n\nThe aims of this study were to add to the body of knowledge in the area of assessment and evaluation through the adoption of the aforementioned integrated perspective, develop formative assessment and evaluation policies and practices in a secondary school to the extent that they are embedded in the school’s working culture and paradigm, and finally to chart the means by which change has been achieved. \n\nThe research is argued to be located in the critical paradigm, adopts an action research methodology in which the researcher assumes a participatory, practitioner researcher role in conducting an ethnographic case study of a secondary school. A social constructivist theme was retained throughout the research design and although both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered, the study was conducted within an interpretative framework informed by symbolic interactionism. \n\nData were gathered via a multi-method approach that included focus groups and semi-structured interviews, observation and accompanying field notes, document and classroom artefact analysis, and non-inferential statistics. Focus groups were used to check data sources, confirm interpretations, develop and disseminate new ideas and approaches, and refine developments based on feedback received. This process was informed by Gladwell’s (2000) notion of ideas taking on the qualities of viruses which in turn develop into epidemics. \n\nParticipants’ early reluctance to accept a need to change was overcome through an initial ‘internal’ audit of current policy and practice relating to learning, teaching, assessment and evaluation, the results of which confirmed the ‘external’ judgements made by OfSTED and the Local Authority (LA) in terms of the need for the school to develop formative approaches to assessment and evaluation. \n\nA purposively selected assessment and evaluation focus group showed a commitment to formative ways of working, and was instrumental in defining and refining new policies for assessment and evaluation in collaboration with other focus groups, non-focus group colleagues, pupils and parents. Additional focus groups for pupil behavioural aspects and mentoring were embraced by the research rather than discouraged in order to retain an integrated ‘real world’ perspective. \n\nThe aims of the study are shown to have been met in that new formative ways of working are now embedded in assessment policy and practice and the researcher has developed a new approach to whole school leadership. This study proposes a new way of thinking that embraces paradox rather than preserving divisions. Moreover, it argues a case for transformative education being reliant on taking this stance. The study also presents a picture of leadership and research based on co-existence and proposes a new ‘Stenhousian’ philosophy where research becomes the basis for leadership.","bibo:AuthorList":["Walters, David","Burden, Robert"],"dc:date":"2009-04-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Religious difference and the many ways of dealing with it are issues in political, social and theological initiatives.  The reality of religious plurality in daily life leaves some Christians wondering about the best way to relate to non-Christian neighbors.  In light of this, a series of questions emerges about who is shaping conversations with people of other faiths and what priorities they reflect.  \nA Lutheran voice is lacking in this debate.  Despite this, there has been a wide response from other Christian traditions.  In some cases denominations have raised questions of religious pluralism as a theological issue, while elsewhere individual theologians have contributed to the debate.  The project that follows will examine such contributions from three ecclesial traditions (Roman Catholic, Evangelical and Protestant) and individual theologians in order to chart some common concerns in the theology of religions debate.  In an effort to highlight a tradition-constituted approach to the other, connections will also be made between individuals’ positions and their ecclesial traditions. \nThis thesis will also propose a distinctively Lutheran theology of religions first by using the works of Martin Luther to introduce the Lutheran history of engagement with non-Christians.  Then, Lutheran statements and resources, partnerships and institutions will be examined to discover the ways in which the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America engages non-Christians. Finally, this project will propose crucial elements for a specifically Lutheran theology of religions. These elements will be put in conversation with individual Lutheran theologians who have made contributions to the debate.  Ultimately a theology of kinship will emerge.  Using distinctively Lutheran themes, this theology recognizes a connection between all people and calls Lutherans to live in kinship with the religious other.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mary Christine Lohr","Markham, Ian","Higton, Mike"],"dc:date":"2009-09-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These munitions included hand and rifle grenades and trench mortars and their ammunition. At the outbreak of war, the British effectively possessed none of these devices and lacked an infrastructure by which they could be quickly designed, manufactured and supplied to the BEF. The British met this challenge with considerable success and the subsequent proliferation of trench warfare munitions had profound consequences for the evolution of British tactics on the Western Front. \nThis thesis examines the processes by which these devices were invented, developed into manufacturable devices and supplied to the BEF. It considers their novelty in respect to similar devices from the American Civil War and the Russo-Japanese War. It looks at how their technical evolution affected tactical developments. The thesis discusses the relationship between the technical characteristics of these devices and the evolution of their tactical employment on the Western Front. It also considers how the characteristics of certain munitions, such as the Stokes mortar and the Mills grenade, directly effected tactics. It argues that the tactical employment of these munitions was dependent upon their functionality, utility and reliability.\nThe present thesis provides a different model of trench warfare conducted by the British during the First World War and thereby demonstrates the significance of the novel munitions under discussion and the role they played in changing infantry warfare. This thesis also provides a different view of the Ministry of Munitions from that usually offered and argues that certain aspects of the Ministry’s role in providing the BEF with munitions has been overstated by virtue of its having underplayed the work of the War Office, while overlooking that conducted by the Royal Engineers in France.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saunders, Anthony James","Black, Jeremy"],"dc:date":"2008-09-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Experimentally, the shape fluctuations of the equatorial contours of red blood cells are recorded using fast phase-contrast video microscopy, from which the Fourier fluctuation spectrum is obtained and analysed. The experimentally obtained fluctuation spectra are interpreted using a coarse grained particle dynamics simulation which models the thermal fluctuations of an elastic mesh endowed with bending and shear elasticity, and constant volume and surface area. We demonstrate that the simulation correctly describes the mean shape of the red cell as well as the membrane thermal fluctuations. Comparison between theory and experiment leads to physically sound values for the relevant membrane elastic moduli and helps distinguish between the contributions of the lipid bilayer and the membrane skeleton.\n\nWe extend this technique to investigate the mechanical response of red blood cells to oxidative stress. We show that it is possible to discriminate between the actions of different oxidising agents from their distinctive effects on the membrane thermal fluctuation spectrum. This allows comparative measures of the membrane material properties to be extracted using an approximate analytical model thus discriminating between the effects of each oxidising agent on different structural components of the membrane.\n\nThis technique was also applied to investigate the response of the red blood cell to oxidative stress under simulated hyperglycemic conditions characteristic for disease states such as diabetes. We established that the membrane elasticity of glycated cells deteriorate much fasted under administration of hydrogen peroxide, which may be related to the observed microvascular complications in diabetes, characterised by disproportionately high levels of reactive oxidative species. We demonstrate that metformin, one of the most widely prescribed anti-diabetic drugs, has an ameliorative effect on the membrane mechanical properties, which is probably due to its anti-glycating effects. \n\nThe technique provides a reproducible means to assess the effects of reactive oxidative species on the red blood cell membrane mechanical properties and distinguish between effects on the protein membrane skeleton and the lipid bilayer. This makes the new method of potential value in monitoring the effects of drug induced changes hence assessing progress of treatment in terms of the antioxidant or anti-glycation properties of administered drugs in diabetes or other conditions characterised by high levels of oxidative stress.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hale, John Peter","Petrov, Dr Peter","Winlove, Professor C Peter"],"dc:date":"2009-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In gold nanostructures, the surface charge density adopts a configuration that is constrained by the shape of the nanoparticles. As a result, the scattering of light by gold nanoparticles exhibits a resonant response characterised by a strong scattering and absorption in a narrow range of frequencies. The spectral range of this \\emph{localised surface plasmon resonance} (LSPR) can be tuned by varying the size and shape of the gold nanoparticle --- the nanoparticles act as nanoscale antennas for the visible light. Confirmation of this scaling rule is obtained by conducting experiments with nanoparticles of varying size and aspect ratio. Such particles are fabricated by electron-beam lithography, and characterised by dark-field spectroscopy. Not only does the LSPR shift in frequency with a change of particle size, but its spectral lineshape is also modified. The intensity and width of the LSPR are dictated by a variety of factors that are related to the intrinsic material properties (the complex dielectric function of gold), and to the particle geometry and environment. \n\nThe optical response of small gold nanorods is well described by a simple oscillating dipole model --- the incident electromagnetic field induces a current in the particle that re-radiates light (scattering). A series of refinements can be made to model more accurately the optical response of realistic particles. If the dipole moment characterising the particle is allowed to vary in phase across the particle, retardation effects provide a correction for the effective dipole moment of the particle. As the particle size approaches the wave length in the surrounding medium, the dipolar approximation breaks down and higher order multipoles need to be considered. The Mie theory provides a very accurate description of the response of spheres of arbitrary size. Further, the T-matrix and other numerical techniques can be employed to accurately reproduce the scattering properties of particles of arbitrary shapes.\n\nWhen the scattering sample consists of a collection of gold nanoparticles, the collective optical response is affected by two key factors. First, the measured LSPR is a convolution of the distribution of particle sizes with the individual response of a single particle. This leads to an inhomogeneous broadening of the LSPR lineshape. Second, the light that is scattered by one such particle near resonance can strongly affect its neighbours which scatter light in proportion to the net field they experience, that is the sum of the incident field plus the perturbation arising from the neighbouring particles. The onset of such multiple scattering events is observed even for particle separations that are several times larger than the particle size. \n\nSeveral regimes of interaction can be distinguished according to the ratio separation / wavelength. First, when the particles are in close proximity (separation $\\ll$ wavelength), near-field interactions dominate and result in a spectral shift of the LSPR accompanied with a spectral broadening. Second, when the separation is commensurate with the wavelength, a coherent interaction can develop that couples a large number of particles. In ordered arrays, such coupling gives rise to a geometrical resonance that can strongly affect the LSPR of the particles. In particular a sharp spectral feature is observed that depends on both the single particle response and the geometrical arrangement of the particles in the array.\n\nThe coherence of such multiple scattering in diffractive arrays of gold nanoparticles can be broken by introducing disorder in the distribution of particle sizes, or in the particle positions. The optical properties of an irregular array reflect the departure from a periodic system and the spectral lineshape evolves as the level of disorder is increased. In the limit of uncorrelated positions, the diffractive coupling is suppressed and the response of the collection of the particles rejoins the response of isolated particles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Auguié, Baptiste","Barnes, William L."],"dc:date":"2009-04-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

While these new graduates should be able to fill the growing demands for English teachers in tertiary and non-tertiary institutions within the UAE, they and other experienced nonnative English speaking teachers (NNEST) are often not hired.  Most often this is due to a nonnative speaker bias, the view that only native English speaking teachers are better suited to teach English.  This bias extends particularly to the teaching of oral and aural skills.  There is a belief that accented English is difficult for students to comprehend especially in academic listening which implies that nonnative teacher accent can hinder ESL/EFL student listening success.  However, current research has not provided empirical evidence to verify or disprove this opinion.\nCurrent research on nonnative speakers and listening comprehension has been based on teacher and student self-perceptions and attitudes towards nonnative speaking teachers (Butler, 2007; Flowerdew, 1994; Friedrich 2000; Huang, 2004; Major et al., 2002; McKenzie, 2008; Moussu, 2002).  However, there is little quantitative data to support if and how these attitudes and perceptions may or may not correlate to EFL student listening performance.  This thesis will attempt to resolve this deficiency.  Another issue this thesis will undertake which has not been examined widely is the effect of nonnative speaker accent on academic listening.  Various studies have been conducted on student difficulty in comprehending academic lectures from native and nonnative speakers (Ferris \u0026 Tagg, 1996; Flowerdew \u0026 Miller, 2005; Huang, 2004; Lynch, 1994; Powers, 1985; Richards, 1983; Vogely, 1995).  Yet, currently, the literature is sparse on the influence of nonnative speaker accent as a factor, or effect, in the listening comprehension of L2 students’ understanding of academic lectures.  Further, existing research in NNESTs is also missing empirical or quantitative evidence which proves or disproves the prevailing theory that native inner circle English accents are significantly better for EFL student academic listening comprehension.  Thus, another goal of this thesis is to provide evidence to disprove this assumption.  Finally, this research will provide qualitative data to understand how students view accent as it relates to their academic achievement and prospective careers.\nThis thesis will propose new empirical data relating to nonnative speaker accent and listening comprehension in ESL/EFL.  It will provide evidence that there is no significant effect of accent on academic listening test scores for EFL students enrolled in a university foundations program at UAE University.  \nIn this research, six EFL professionals (from China, Egypt and the USA) and 108 EFL students participated in the study.  The female students were between 18-20 years old, from the UAE, and studying at the Under Graduate Requirements Unit at UAE University in Al Ain, UAE.  All students responded to a pre-test questionnaire in a Likert scale format.  A week later, the students listened to one recording, took a corresponding exam, and answered a post-test survey.  Two to three days later, 18 randomly selected students were interviewed.  The interviews consisted of open-ended questions.\nThe data were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively.  Analysis of the quantitative data shows that the majority of participants considered native speakers of English easier to understand, specifically in terms of pronunciation and understandability, but had no opinion as to whether a non-native speaker was easier to understand than a native speaker.  As per the listening test scores, there were no significant differences between the six groups of students who had listened to six different speaker accents.  Analysis of the interviews shows that students have no bias against nonnative English teachers.  In fact, several students favored Arab nonnative English speaking teachers to translate vocabulary and complex ideas from English to Arabic.  These students also demonstrated an unrealistic grasp of their need to understand the varieties of English they will encounter in their future workplaces.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barlow, Lisa","Riley, Susan; Troudi, Salah"],"dc:date":"2009-10-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, there has not been any research carried out on the topics that mainland Chinese university students enjoy writing about when corresponding with their Western epals, nor does the literature report research on writing e-mails to two groups of epals simultaneously. This study explores what issues concerned the participants when they exchanged e-mails with their Western epals and how they viewed their cross-cultural learning experience. The participants were 28 mainland Chinese second-year English majors who voluntarily corresponded with 28 American high school pupils and 28 Western adult epals for about two months in Autumn 2006. The data of this exploratory interpretative research was mainly collected from their e-mails, ‘final reports’, the mid-project questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews.  \n\nThe study found that the topics the participants enjoyed writing about actually depended on with whom they were corresponding. With the younger school pupils, they tended to look for friendship by talking about pastimes, their own high school experience, etc. To the more sophisticated adult epals though, they wrote largely about personal matters, on which they seemed to be covertly seeking advice. However, some topics were common to both groups and were equally popular – for example, school and daily life. The data also reveals that the majority of the participants enjoyed the experience and overall had positive views about it. These fall into three broad categories of learning: language, cultural, and communication. However, some experienced minor difficulties and problems in these areas, particularly regarding the communication aspect.\n\nMeanwhile, in the process of the participants multiediting their ‘final reports’, learning seems to have occurred between their first and final drafts – perhaps as a result of responding to the researcher’s written feedback, which seemed to make a significant difference. The implications arising from the study suggest that the students’ interest in it stimulated their engagement with learning - though the findings are tentative. Some recommendations for further research are also given.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wei-Tzou, Hsiou-Chi","MacDonald, Malcolm","Troudi, Salah"],"dc:date":"2009-04-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In the UK, all-cash acquisitions show insignificant negative or small positive abnormal returns, whilst the all-equity acquisitions have significant negative returns. Whilst it is tempting to conclude that it is simply the form of financing that separates the shareholder value destruction of equity-financed takeovers from cash takeovers, such a conclusion tends to ignore the question of where the cash to fund the acquisition comes from in the first place. Theory tells us this should matter. Whilst different theories on firm financing offer competing explanations on both managerial choices and shareholder preferences, it seems reasonable to ask the question whether the source of the cash influences the long run wealth effect of the acquisition. In order to shed light on this issue, this investigation looks at short-term daily abnormal returns as well as long-term abnormal returns including a five-year horizon of post-takeover returns and a three-year horizon of pre-takeover returns. \n\nThe short-term daily abnormal returns support the signalling information hypothesis to some extent as acquirers financing takeovers using internal cash out-perform those financing takeovers by equity or debt issues. After categorizing the research sample firms into two sub-groups, one being internal funding while the other being external sources including equity or debt, the share price abnormal returns show statistically significant differences between these two sub-groups over 11-day event windows. Further, by using one- and two-dimensional analyses and a univariate test, the results reveal that UK cash acquisitions explored by this investigation contradict the free cash flow (FCF) hypothesis. Regression models show that book-to-market ratio is important in explaining the short-term daily abnormal returns. \n\nThe long-term post-takeover stock performances show sensitivity to the benchmark adopted as well as the calculation used for the long-term abnormal returns, i.e. cumulated or compounded. Owing to the small sample firms entering the calendar time monthly portfolios, the calendar time approach employs White (1980) corrections and a GLS model to mitigate the effects of heteroskedasticity in the research sample. Generally speaking, long-term abnormal returns show a negative pattern for the whole sample as well as the sub-groups depending on their dominant financing methods. Furthermore, the univariate and multivariate tests demonstrate that the FCF hypothesis cannot explain the 60-month share price abnormal returns of the research sample. According to the coefficient derived from regression model(s), the most significant factor to predict 60-month abnormal returns is relative size (market value of target to that of bidder). The results suggest that the bigger the relative size of the target, the more negative the abnormal return will be (Hansen 1987, Martin 1996, Loughran and Vijh 1997). Besides, the institutional investors contribute a positive effect on long-term share price performance, which is consistent with the findings of Chen, Harford, and Li (2007). \n\nThe pre-takeover share price abnormal returns over three years intervals prior to the bid announcements clearly show that cash acquirers overall experience a significant positive stock performance. This result is robust to adopting various benchmarks of event time and calendar time regression-based framework. Based on the dominant financing method used for the acquirers, firms issuing debt before the bid announcements do perform extremely well. Those firms subsequently perform badly for post-takeover long-term intervals. Accordingly, this phenomenon demonstrates a mean reversion picture. Regardless of whether an event time or a calendar time approach is used, high q firms always have higher abnormal returns even when allowing for other factors, such as free cash flow or cash stock. However, multinomial logistic tests fail to find any statistically significant link between pre- takeover abnormal returns and the form of financing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, Yuan-Hsin","Gregory, Alan"],"dc:date":"2009-05-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The research regarded adolescent economic socialization and the development of saving behaviour as an integral part of general socialization and adolescent psychological development. \n\nThe importance of saving was investigated relative to alternative ways for getting larger sums of money. Three large survey studies with adolescents and one survey study with adolescents and their parents were carried out. In Study 1, 470 students between the ages of 11 and 18 took part. The results of this study revealed that adolescents do think of saving as a means of accumulating larger sums of money. Studies 2 and 3 sampled 290 and 443 students between the ages of 11 and 17 and 13 to 14, respectively, providing empirical evidence of adolescents’ endeavour for independence, reflected by their saving motives as well as the changing of their attitudes towards saving as a skill. The thesis examined a number of significant predictors for adolescents’ general tendency to save. \n\nThe studies linked adolescent saving with home atmosphere and perceived parenting style empirically for the first time.  A path model illustrates the associations that were found between the behaviour and attitudes of the parents and the saving behaviour and attitudes of their adolescent child. It demonstrates that the development of saving behaviour is linked to the power relationship between parent and child. The findings support the behavioural life-cycle hypothesis as well as the benefits of being raised in an ‘authoritative home’ with regard to skills in saving.","bibo:AuthorList":["Otto, Annette Michaela Cosima","Webley, Paul","Slater, Alan"],"dc:date":"2009-06-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This thesis centres on such screens in Devon, while seeking to place them in the context of their history in England as a whole. It discusses their origins, the period of their flowering in the later middle ages, and their fate at the Reformation, which swept away their lofts and iconography but kept their basic structures. While the heart of the thesis lies in the period from 1300 to 1570, consideration is also given to their subsequent fate between about 1570 and about 1870, when many disappeared due to changing fashions in church layout and furnishing. It concludes by showing how modern conservation, since 1870, has preserved most of those that remained as well as studying and restoring them.\n      The thesis uses all the available primary and secondary sources for Devon, and major comparative ones for the rest of England. It discusses and criticises the evidence of churchwardens’ accounts, wills, the writings of the Protestant reformers of the mid-sixteenth century, royal and episcopal visitation articles, injunctions and  orders for the period  during and after the Reformation, antiquarian researches of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Church faculty records, and conservation reports made on screens in recent decades, as well as the major modern secondary works on the subject beginning with that of A. W. N. Pugin in 1851. Attention has also been given to the screens that survive, and to how they were constructed and decorated.\n      The research shows that considerable sums were spent during the later middle ages on the construction, decoration, and maintenance of screens in all churches, from cathedrals and monasteries to parish churches. Parish communities in particular saw them as status symbols, raised money for their manufacture, and tried to match the best examples in nearby churches. Screens throw light on church layout, since they emphasised the division of the church into two areas, and on the organisation and understanding of worship, which they were designed both to seclude from and to reveal to the congregation. The iconography of screens provides valuable information about the cults of saints in late-medieval parishes.\n      Screens became an issue during the Reformation, which did away with the iconography of screens but usually tolerated their survival, thereby retaining a visual object important to parishioners and the traditional division of the church that the screens embodied. Although some screens may have been removed in the sixteenth century, the greatest period of destruction was probably in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, when screens clashed with the wish of Church leaders and people to have open church interiors with uninterrupted vistas, and in the mid to late nineteenth century, the period of church restoration when ecclesiological principles were at their most influential.  \n      The thesis concludes with a gazetteer of all the screens in Devon churches that survive or are known to have existed on the basis of historical and antiquarian records.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Michael Aufrere","Hamilton, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2008-06-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Dugout logboats from Bohemia and Moravia (Czech Republic) are used as proxy artifacts to make this transmittal visible. Boats in general and riverine watercraft specifically, are an unusual class of artifact, as they are neither completely portable nor permanently fixed in place. The movement of watercraft is restricted to a relatively narrow corridor through the landscape. The morphology and construction of logboats are reflective of skill sets and technological traditions. Pre-literate boat construction traditions and technology, spread through personal contact and experience, may thus be traced through close examination of the technical features of surviving examples. In many parts of Europe, however, dugout logboats remain an extremely uncontextualized category of artefact. Placing these vessels in their appropriate geographic, environmental, and human contexts helps us to understand their meaning and forms (and the behavior of their builders and operators).  The geographic element of this investigation is especially significant, as the spread of information and skill sets in physical space is a main focus of the thesis. The Czech Lands sit astride one of Europe’s main continental divides, and rivers originating on this territory flow to the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Black Sea. Topographic conditions have funneled travel and transport in this region through the river valleys and across a few key passes or watershed boundaries. Water transport, far more efficient than overland haulage, was likely an important element in trans-continental trade and exchange. Analysis of the surviving logboats from this region indicates that different construction traditions prevailed in different watershed areas. These data also suggest a model explaining the mechanisms by which boats can change. Key elements of the model include an inherent conservatism of boat design; internal change, driven by social or environmental factors; and external change, adopted through the personal experience of the boat builder or operator. The model is subsequently tested against case studies of vessels from other regions of Europe, and other types of watercraft.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rogers, Jason Samuel","Van de Noort, Robert"],"dc:date":"2009-08-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The ‘Plymouth Precision Teaching Project’ was conducted during the 2007/8 academic year commencing in September 2007 through to April 2008. The project involved the delivery of regular Precision Teaching (PT) programmes across two cohorts (1 and 2) of students by Teaching Assistants (TAs) in each school who themselves received ongoing training and support throughout the project. This thesis reports on three inter-connected aspects of research stemming from the project:\n\nAspect One considered the impact of PT interventions delivered by trained TAs on groups of secondary school students with literacy learning needs through a quasi-experimental design. \n\nAspect Two investigated the adaptations made by TAs within PT programmes to improve student word reading skills; from here a framework for systematic teaching adaptations was formulated, trialled and reviewed. \n\nAspect Three drew on the experiences of school staff and their learning throughout the initiative. The value of participating in the research was investigated through exploring TAs’ reflections on the development of their understanding of the processes and practices surrounding ‘teaching and learning’. \nOutcomes of the research point to the continuing contribution of PT to addressing basic reading skill needs through heightened structure to intervention delivery, promotion and scrutiny of ‘treatment fidelity’ and an ongoing, systemic approach to the development of staff skills. This thesis also emphasises the mutual benefits that a collaborative project such as this can bring about; not only can staff contribute to the development of intervention approaches and provide high-quality interventions, but they can also develop their professional knowledge too. As a venture networking schools, a local authority educational psychology service and a university department, it is suggested this thesis reflects a description of the ground modernised educational psychology services should seek to occupy more and more.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roberts, William George","Norwich, Brahm"],"dc:date":"2009-03-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

If this is correct, it is incongruous that States could breach jus cogens norms with impunity.  This thesis approaches this statement from two angles.  Firstly, it questions whether States do in fact enjoy impunity; or whether there is a formal, or even ad hoc, practice of holding States accountable.  Secondly, this thesis asks what it means to hold States accountable - whether the changing conception of international law, that accommodates jus cogens norms, is also developing to recognise a changing conception of State accountability.\n\nIn order to answer these questions this thesis conceptualises State accountability as an interpretive framework, with which to analyse relevant State practice and identify juridical support for State accountability.  In addition, consideration is given to how a theoretical concept of State accountability relates to existing doctrines of public international law and illustrates why it is that State and juridical support for a conceptual principle of accountability exists when there is already an established principle of State responsibility.\n\nIt is submitted that rather than being an established legal principle, State accountability has legal, political and even moral characteristics and although the concept is currently lex feranda there is evidence of an evolution to lex lata.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yarwood, Lisa","Fournet, Caroline","Sari, Aurel"],"dc:date":"2009-10-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The effects and symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) have been very well documented in adult populations. They include impairments in muscle function (isometric and dynamic strength, power and rate of force development and flexibility), an increase in the release of muscle proteins (e.g. creatine kinase), delayed onset muscle soreness and an increase in perceived exertion.   However, very little research has focussed on the effects of EIMD on electromechanical delay and sensorimotor performance. Even less attention has focussed on the effects of strenuous eccentric exercise on children populations. To date, only four studies have investigated the effects of EIMD in children, although these studies did not assess the effects of EIMD on sensorimotor performance. \nThis thesis comprises six chapters:\n•\tChapter 1: Introduction\n•\tChapter 2: Review of Literature\n•\tChapter 3: Reproducibility and Single Measurement Reliability of Indices of Neuromuscular and Sensorimotor Performance of the Knee Flexors in Adults and Children.\n•\tChapter 4: Evaluation of the Effects of two bouts of strenuous isokinetic eccentric exercise on Sensorimotor and Neuromuscular Performance of the knee flexors in Men and Women.\n•\tChapter 5: Evaluation of the effects of a bout of strenuous eccentric exercise on sensorimotor and neuromuscular performance of the knee flexors in young athletes.\n•\tChapter 6: Further thoughts, conclusions and limitations. \n\nChapter 3 examined the single-measurement reliability and reproducibility of selected indices of neuromuscular and sensorimotor performance that were deployed in the subsequent chapters of this thesis in adults and children. The results demonstrated no statistically significant differences (P \u003e 0.05) between groups (males, females, boys and girls), which suggested that considerations regarding the testing protocols could be made on the same basis for all the selected groups. Similarly, no significant differences were observed between legs (preferred, non-preferred) in any of the involved groups. Furthermore, the findings demonstrated that single-trial protocols are not powerful enough for the accurate discrimination of intra-session differences in performance capabilities especially during intra-individual assessments and moreover are insufficient for the correct interpretation of neuromuscular and sensorimotor performance between days. \n\tChapter 4 assessed the effects of two bouts of exercise-induced muscle damage on neuromuscular and sensorimotor performance of the knee flexors of both legs in males and females. The eccentric exercise protocols were associated with impaired peak force, elevated soreness, decreased passive flexibility, prolonged electromechanical delay and preserved sensorimotor performance. However, no significant differences between men and women were observed. Interestingly, the prolonged electromechanical delay and the preserved sensorimotor performance were the novel and most important findings of this study and were contrary to previous observations. \nFinally chapter 5 assessed the effects of a strenuous eccentric exercise protocol on neuromuscular and sensorimotor performance of the knee flexors of both legs in boys and girls (aged 11-14 years) who were members of the Exeter Tennis Centre. The eccentric exercise protocol was associated with impaired peak force, elevated soreness, decreased passive flexibility, and preserved electromechanical delay and sensorimotor performance. Interestingly, all impaired indices of muscle function returned to baseline 72 hours after the damaging protocol. Moreover, there were no significant sex differences. Further analysis revealed that boys and girls experienced milder symptoms of muscle damage than men and women, with the adult participants demonstrating higher levels of peak force decrease and of delayed onset muscle soreness.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tsakiris, Alexandros","Gleeson, Nigel","Eston, Roger G"],"dc:date":"2009-06-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Age criticism is a\nrelatively new discipline – the word ‘ageism’ was only coined in 1968 by\nsociologist Robert Butler – but it has been asking this question since its\ninception. Feminists were among the first to investigate the idea of ‘age\nidentity,’ and during the 1980s a handful of American older lesbian feminists took\nthe women’s movement to task about its own ageism. Writers like Baba Copper\nand Barbara MacDonald argued that age is not only a state of mind but a\npolitical construction, anticipating much that has now become mainstream in the\nthinking of age identity. Since then, there has been a growing recognition that\n‘age ideology,’ from birthday cards to employment law, delivers negative\nmessages about ageing as decline, deterioration and loss. But there are still not\nenough representations of older people – and especially older women – which\noffer a positive paradigm for ageing, one that goes beyond platitudes of\nacceptance, or, more insidiously, the chimera of retaining ‘youth’ in old age.\nMy thesis traces the early work of lesbian and feminist writers as they explored\nthe subjectivity of older women at a time when this was still rare. I argue that\nthis writing still has much to offer in challenging conventional and negative ideas\nof agerelated\nchanges, without sentimentalising or denying physical, as well as\nsocial, pain. I begin by setting out an overview of the theory that has\naccompanied this writing, including Copper and MacDonald’s work. In particular,\nI explore its expansion in Margaret Gullette’s theory of diachronic identity, in\nwhich the fluid character of identity means that many ages can exist\nsimultaneously, and Kathleen Woodward’s notion of a ‘mirror stage’ in midand\nolder life. Such concepts provide guiding tools for my subsequent analysis of\nlesbian age writing. The thesis goes on to examine novels, life writing and poetry\nby older lesbians, organising the material thematically: chapters deal with\nmenopause, memory and forgetting, sexuality and mortality respectively.\nThe conclusion hinges on lesbian age theory as an aspect of feminist and gender\nresearch based at the interface of queer and age identities. Minority writing on\noldness has a particular usefulness in delineating the specificities of difference, or\nwhat critic Margaret Cruikshank has called ‘the “inbetween\nworlds” within aging.’\nWork by older lesbians can be seen as a tool for both understanding and shaping\nthe experience of old age. This very particular literature, through its emphasis\non continuity, friendship and community, refuses prescribed ‘life stages’ and\ninstead offers paradigms for conscious and comfortable ageing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lowery, Penelope Jane","Jolly, Margaretta"],"dc:date":"2007-07-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However with the emergence of numerous applications for terahertz light in diverse areas such as security scanning, biological imaging, gas spectroscopy and astrophysics there has been considerable recent growth in the volume of research activity in this area. The studies presented in this thesis aim to introduce the physics of surface plasmons to the terahertz frequency range, and on the way to use some of the unique capabilities of terahertz spectroscopy to try and find new information about fundamental surface-plasmon based electromagnetic structures.\nFour distinct experiments are described in this work, all of them underpinned by the technique of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (Chapter 2). This is a very powerful and adaptable spectroscopic method which allows us to measure the electric field of pulsed terahertz radiation as a function of time. This in turn allows us to directly extract both phase and amplitude of the terahertz light as a function of frequency, over a broad frequency range. Furthermore, this method of terahertz spectroscopy can be combined with photoexcitation pulses of visible/NIR light which can be used to make dynamic changes to the properties of materials in the terahertz beam.\nThe first experiment reported (Chapter 3) measures the propagation of coupled surface plasmons in a resonant slit cavity. We use terahertz time-domain spec- troscopy to determine the characteristics of the cavity resonances in a semiconductor slit near the surface plasma frequency of the material, where we are able to mea- sure very large red-shifts in the frequency of the cavity resonance. By considering the phase information which can be extracted directly from time-resolved terahertz measurements we are able to link the behaviour of the resonances to the propagation characteristics of the surface plasmon modes inside the slits.\nThe second experiment (Chapter 4) is a more direct measurement of surface plasmons, propagated over the surface of a semiconductor wafer. We show that the electric field of the surface plasmon is confined to a subwavelength region around the surface, and that the confined field is useful for spectroscopy of very thin layers above the surface. We are able to measure films with thickness less than 1/600th of the wavelength of the terahertz light.\nAfter these two experiments with confined semiconductor surface plasmons we move on to a pair of experiments looking at terahertz surface modes mediating the transmission of light through holes in metal films. In the initial experiment (Chapter 5) we use the time-domain data from terahertz spectroscopy to determine the role that surface mode lifetime plays in modifying the amplitude and width of Extraor- dinary Optical Transmission (EOT) resonances, which arise from the periodicity of a hole-array lattice. By changing the temperature of the lossy dielectric semicon- ductor substrate we are able to modify the surface mode lifetime, and link this to the resonant transmission characteristics.\nIn Chapter 6 we extend the hole array EOT experiment by making dynamic changes to the propagation of the surface mode which mediates the transmission. This is achieved by photo-exciting the semiconductor substrate inside the holes and forming a thin layer of material with high charge carrier density on the surface. Interaction of the surface mode with the photoexcited region quenches the resonant transmission. We show that by changing the hole size so that the surface-mode mediated transmission pathway predominates in the spectrum it is possible to use optical pulses to modulate the transmission of terahertz radiation with very high efficiency.\nIn the conclusions (Chapter 7) we link together some of the insights and infer- ences which can be drawn from the above results, as well as evaluating the efficacy of the experimental and simulation methodology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Isaac, Thomas Henry","Hendry, Euan","Barnes, William L."],"dc:date":"2009-11-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9029590,"sim:weight":0.281368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While important, such perspectives do not provide for a complete understanding of the systemic, processual character of VC emergence.  A multistage process model of emergence is developed, linking industry structural characteristics and their underlying processes to precursor resources through the intermediate processes of coproduction and diffusion.  Using data from multiple embedded case studies in South Africa and Botswana, this model integrates four processes--simultaneity, coproduction, diffusion, and the VC cycle.  These processes are linked by a logic that is dominated by initial conditions and includes elements of rational choice (conditioned by path dependence) and altruism.  The establishment of appropriate simultaneity conditions enables the diffusion of the established VC model and related institutions from other populations.  In the presence of a market failure, government investors and private fund managers can then cooperate to fill the equity gap, creating the signal necessary for replication of additional VC funds through the functioning of the VC cycle.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lingelbach, David Charles","Murray, Gordon"],"dc:date":"2009-04-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

How do ideas get noticed, developed and implemented? Why do certain ideas appear and then disappear without lasting impact? The project was based on a conception of organisations and ideas that was ecological: organisations provide an environment in which ideas can grow, compete, achieve dominance, find a niche or simply fade away. This ecological metaphor began to surface critical problems that questioned its viability. After reviewing the notion of ideas, from Plato through Descartes, Locke, Lovejoy and Whitehead to Rogers, Czarniawska and Latour, the concept of ideas-as-things is seen as problematic, and a better way is proposed, conceiving of ideas as processes: as human-material interactions.\nThis hypothesis repositions the inquiry towards conceiving of organisations as idea- and therefore process-complexes. If ideas are processes and organisations are processes then the distinction between the two becomes difficult to make. If the concept of ideas retains meaning it is as a perspective for interpreting process-complexes that focuses on the way processes develop from the imaginary towards the material. \nThis leads to exploring the nature of the world-as-process. Our conception of reality appears to be framed within a substantive, as opposed to processual, world-view whereby the processes of perception, recognition and verbalisation constitute the means by which the underlying continuum of experience is translated into the discrete components of the world-of-things. It seems that we cannot intellectualise process without simultaneously alienating ourselves from it. How can we conceive of the world-as-process without obscuring it behind the world-of-things? \nContemporary process theories can be divided into two broad groups: those that deal with process as specific phenomena within a substantive organisation (exogenous); and those that treat organisation-as-process (endogenous). Those theories in the former group avoid the problems of process altogether while those in the latter largely focus on discursive and intellectual processes, leaving the world of materiality as a secondary phenomenon. There is one field of study, however, where materiality is treated as a primary part of social processes: in Actor Network Theory. Here, however, materiality is granted equal status to human actors, de-centring the importance of human-material interactions.\nThis thesis attempts to develop a novel position on process that centres on human-material interactions. It starts with a simple scheme that envisages social processes to be autonomous from but dependent upon biological processes, that are themselves autonomous from but dependent on underlying physical processes. By considering how each of these processes emerged from its predecessor it proposes a model of process genesis. This model is used to develop a speculative account of how social processes emerged from the biological, identifying the critical role of technology as autocatalytic and durable, and of language in providing variety to enable the social processes to develop autonomously from the biological. The resulting model is of a complex-conjugate process that integrates materiality with intellection. This model incorporates elements of existing process theories: processes of sensemaking and communication entwined around material processes involving technologies. Both technology and intellection provide potentiality that is actualised through the human body,  creating further potentiality. Technology stores and mobilising potentiality while intellection provides creativity. \nMethodology remains problematic for processual research. It is intellectually-intensive and therefore constrained by the substantive nature of all description. A processual approach can  limit the “thickness” of this descriptive layer and stay as close to the processual as possible. The author proposes a tool box of process-sympathetic methods, drawing on the discipline of archaeology for inspiration. Archaeologists place a primacy in materiality, being the only remaining component of the social processes they study. The processual archaeologist pieces together extinct processes from this materiality. This improvised methodology is explored through the medium of a case study concerning the fate and fortune of one particular idea within one particular organisations. The idea was Value Based Management and the organisation; a large international company in the late 1990\u0027s.\nThis research project provides a tentative proposal for a processual model that could be useful in studying organisation. It suggests that whilst most “process studies” are carried out from a largely substantive world-view, and others are largely concerned with intellectual or discursive processes, there may be an approach that integrates the importance of the technological with the intellectual while remaining focused on central role of the human body. It is very much an unfinished project that requires development in many directions before its own potentiality can be properly tested.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sharp, Robert James","Newton, Tim","De Cock, Christian"],"dc:date":"2008-04-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.34439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This thesis considers how coquettish female beauty has been embodied in Victorian literature by the Brontës, Dickens, George Eliot, Christina Rossetti, and to a lesser extent women’s periodical literature.  It argues that the figure of the coquette addresses antithetical discourses on the Victorian woman and assimilates them in such a way as to express a subversive beauty discourse, in which beauty consolidates differing female experiences and formulates the search for identity as a collective female effort.\nThe coquette is linked with controversial women’s issues such as marriage failure, domestic abuse and female eroticism; the ambivalence of her relationship with the text’s heroine shows the scope and limits of female autonomy.  The dialectic between rejection and acceptance in which the coquette participates in specific narrative strategies shows women engaged with women’s problems, their erotic potential, and their relationship(s) to each other.  \nThe thesis also reflects on feminist literary theory, especially current ideas on female writing, broadly defined as a search for female belonging.  Recent criticism holds that the Victorian coquette operates either to show that eroticism was part of the Victorian woman’s identity, or as a passive surface upon which certain aspects of the protagonist are illuminated.  This thesis argues that this is only part of the story; additionally, the issue of eroticism is installed within a framework of women’s social, political, and legal concerns, and the coquette can be read as an active site in which aspects of both the coquette and the protagonist are combined to form an innovative way of seeing the Victorian woman.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ioannou, Maria","Gagnier, Regenia"],"dc:date":"2009-03-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The author takes the view that students’ subjectivity was influenced by the dominant mores of elements of society, such as family and school, and less often, by individual, autonomous decision.\n\nCase studies of practices that are identified with the tenets of TIE were carried out using approaches based on the principles and methods of a critical pedagogy approach.  How could the TIE approach be seen as a critical pedagogy?  This question is examined predominantly through the lens of Paulo Freire and Henry A. Giroux’s thoughts on education and teachers.\n\nIn addition to an understanding of the tenets of TIE and the tenets of critical pedagogy, this thesis presents a criticism of its discursive approach and also a criticism from the researcher as a participant observer.  This narrative approach helps explore the human side of the experience thus keeping real life issues to the fore.\n\nFieldwork episodes of TIE practice in three different levels of schools, the Taipei He-te Primary School, 10 different senior high schools and the National Taiwan University are presented in the context of the students’ differing ages in an attempt to understand more about the methods and tenets of TIE.  ‘Partnership’ is a key concept and driving force, creating mutual cooperation between the community of the school, the parents and the theatre groups.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this thesis include the clarification notions of TIE, and the adoption of a subjective approach by the students in relation to the process of interactivity, leading from affection to cognition, then action.\n\nThis thesis concludes that TIE is a critical pedagogy and praxis, which develops skills and attitudes in which action can be taken by the individual in fitting in the world.  It improves the individual’s ability to rethink his/her beliefs and attitudes, to empathise with groups of people and individuals with whom she/he previously may not have come into social contact with and allows previously taboo subjects to be discussed openly.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jung, Shu-hwa","Somers, John"],"dc:date":"2008-10-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The topics I look at include mechanism, emergence, cellular complexity, and the informational role of the genome. I develop a perspective that stresses the intimacy of the relations between ontology and epistemology. Whether a phenomenon looks mechanistic, or complex, or indeed emergent, is largely an epistemic matter, yet has an objective basis in features of the world. \n\nAfter reviewing several concepts of mechanism I consider the influential recent account of Machamer, Darden and Craver (MDC). That account makes interesting proposals concerning the relationship between mechanistic explanation and intelligibility, which are consistent with the results of the investigation I undertake into the science surrounding protein folding. In relation to a number of other issues pertaining to biological systems I conclude that the MDC account is insufficiently nuanced, however, leading me to outline an alternative approach to mechanism. This emphasizes the importance of structure—function relations and addresses issues raised by reflection on the nature of cellular complexity. These include the distinction between structure and process and the different possible bases on which system organization may be maintained.\n\nThe account I give of emergence construes the phenomenon in terms of psychological deficit: phenomena are emergent when we lack the capacity to trace through and model their causal structures using our cognitive schemas. I conclude by developing these ideas into a preliminary and partial account of explanation and understanding. This aspires to cover the significant fraction of work in molecular and cell biology that correlates biological structures, processes and functions by visualizing phenomena and making them imaginable.","bibo:AuthorList":["Powell, Alexander","Dupre, John","O\u0027Malley, Maureen"],"dc:date":"2009-12-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The nature of the emergent knowledge arising from this inquiry hinges on the analysis and interpretation by the researcher who is also a complete participant in this educational context of her informants’ perceptions from their retrospection, and a reconstruction of the past, in present time.\n\nThe methodology I adopted broadly follows interpretative qualitative research principles, including aspects of life history inquiry. The data generation process employed to explore our perceptions of ourselves, as well as our working context, before and during the 1990s, as we ourselves narrate them, comprised of: ‘conversations with a purpose’, critical incident and repertory grid interviews, as well as the concurrent analysis of the data, based on aspects of Grounded Theory. As a result, numerous categories and concepts emerged. These not only helped me to discover the issues that were both instrumental and influential regarding our positive receptivity to change, but also how being involved in a change process changed us, not only as individuals, but also as a culture.\n\nBased on these findings that have led to my deeper understanding of the nature of educational change, I conclude this thesis by positing that instead of adopting a mechanistic paradigm for viewing change, it is necessary, and more useful, to view it through the lens of complexity theory. Finally, this thesis ends by examining the implications that this position and the findings have for change policy makers, managers and change leaders, as well as suggestions for future research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Scholes Gillings de Gonzàlez, Barbara","Wright, Tony","Troudi, Salah"],"dc:date":"2009-10-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The\nexperiments were performed on micro-arrays of square nanomagnets in order to\ncharacterise the static and time-dependent behaviour of the nanomagnets. The static\nbehaviour was investigated in vector-resolved scanning Kerr microscopy experiments,\nwhile the time-dependent behaviour was investigated in time-resolved scanning Kerr\nmicroscopy experiments. In the latter so-called pump-probe experiments, magnetisation\ndynamics were induced by exciting the sample magnetisation with a pulsed magnetic\nfield (pump). The magnetisation dynamics were then detected using the magnetooptical\npolar Kerr effect (probe). The longitudinal Kerr effect was utilised in the vectorresolved\nscanning Kerr microscope in order to measure the in-plane components of the\nstatic magnetisation. The experimental set-up and methodology of the vector- and timeresolved\nscanning Kerr microscopy experiments will be discussed in detail, in\nparticular, the detection technique that allows three components of the vector\nmagnetisation to be measured simultaneously. Since the spatial resolution of the\nmagneto-optical probe was insufficient to resolve the spatial character of the\nmagnetisation dynamics within individual nanomagnets, micromagnetic simulations\nwere used to gain insight into the character of the excited modes. Extensive testing of\ndifferent micromagnetic models was carried out in order to investigate the effect of the\ndifferent models on the simulated dynamics. The results of measurements carried out\non the arrays of square nanomagnets revealed that the static and time-dependent\nbehaviour of the magnetisation became more complicated as the size of the\nnanomagnets was reduced. In particular, similar hysteresis loops were acquired when\nthe elements were magnetised along the uniaxial anisotropy easy and hard axes, while\nfast Fourier transform spectra of time-resolved signals revealed that the character of the\nmagnetisation dynamics changed significantly as the element size and/or applied\nmagnetic field were reduced. Interpretation of the experimental results using\nmicromagnetic simulations revealed that the elements had a non-uniform single domain\nground state magnetisation. When the field was applied along either edge of the square\nelements and reversed, the magnetisation was found to switch via a series of metastable\nnon-uniform single domain states. Furthermore, the increasing non-uniformity of the\nsingle domain ground state as the element size and/or applied field were reduced lead to\nsignificant changes in the mode character excited within the elements. Comparison of\n2\nexperimental spectra with simulated spectra and Fourier images of the dynamic\nmagnetisation revealed that as the element size and/or applied field were reduced, the\nmode character changed from one that occupied the majority of the volume of the\nelement, to several modes that were localised near to the edges of the element that were\nperpendicular to the applied field. Furthermore, deviation of the direction of the\nwavevector of the dynamic magnetisation from the direction of the static magnetisation\nwas found to lead to a dynamic configurational anisotropy within nanomagnets.\nFollowing the presentation of the experimental results, the recent developments for\nfuture experimental work are presented with the aim to study precessional switching in\nan isolated nanomagnet. The results obtained in the experiments presented in this thesis\nare expected to lead to a better understanding of the non-uniform magnetisation\ndynamics in square nanomagnets, which have application in future magnetic data\nstorage technologies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Keatley, Paul Steven","Hicken, Robert J"],"dc:date":"2008-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The sociocultural model of identity unites an individual’s psychodynamic continuity with the roles and positions that emerge from his/her social interactions. The setting for the investigation is a small single-sex, non-traditional secondary school, in which the sample is seven boys, ages sixteen to eighteen, who have lost interest in the academic mainstream. Qualitative data were collected on individual boys, and then matched in a table to the theoretical framework. The study raised five issues about identity, struggling teenage boys, and school mathematics. To negotiate the dialectic of opposing identity norms, struggling teenage boys employed identities as expressive tools that held desirable positions for them in school mathematics. In the organization of multiple identities, salience depended upon the intrinsic and extrinsic gratification associated with knowledge of mathematics. Positive mathematical identities clustered with compatible social identities that were also supported by these rewards. The sociohistorical availability of identities increased in nontraditional mathematics courses that provided the boys with opportunities to enact positive roles. Many of the boys communicated positive attitudes towards school mathematics in relation to their future career goals. Though they may have struggled, they expected to achieve conventional success in the adult world. The issue of identity and emotions was illustrated by the shame and mistrust that accompanied the loss of a former identity such as a “gifted” level in school mathematics. For some struggling teenage boys, mistrustfulness was evident in their discussions about money. They expressed an affinity for simple arithmetic, which they could easily master with repetitive practice. Implications for teaching include cultivating future-oriented identities, incorporating ‘money’ themes, and offering customized courses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Browne, Melinda Evelyn","Myhill, Debra"],"dc:date":"2009-09-24","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Tumour detection, in the early stages, is crucial if patients are to be treated effectively and with minimally invasive procedures. Thus, any technique that can improve on, or add to, existing breast tumour detection methods is welcome. In this thesis just such a technique based on near-field microwave imaging is investigated, both theoretically and experimentally. The electromagnetic waves interaction with dielectric structure is fundamental for any microwave application. Thus it is essential to understand the interaction of the microwaves radiated from the sensor (open-ended rectangular waveguide) with the breast structure under investigation.\nA detailed mathematical model describing the interaction of microwaves emitted from an open rectangular wave-guide with an N-layer dielectric structure is developed, using the Fourier Transform Matching method. The model is capable of calculating the electric field properties anywhere within the N-layer structure, as well as the complex reflection coefficient existing at the waveguide aperture.\nComputer simulations, based on the mathematical formulations derived using the Fourier Transform Matching method, of the near-field radiation patterns in a 3-layer approximation to the general N-layer model are presented. Such simulations are most useful in assessing the suitability of near-field microwave non-invasive testing and evaluation (NIT\u0026E) technique for breast tumour detection. In addition, simulated 1-D and 2-D reflection phase and magnitude images are calculated and presented for the 3-layer structure with an inclusion to represent the presence of a tumour. Parameters controlling the detection sensitivity, specifically the frequency of operation, waveguide filling, and standoff distance dielectric filling, are investigated to obtain the optimal - 2 -\nparameters for the inspection system. The theoretical simulations show that a high sensitivity in both reflection coefficient magnitude and phase should be obtainable.\nExperimental measurements of the reflection coefficient magnitude and phase when imaging a breast phantom that imitates real breast dielectric properties contrast are also presented. The phantom comprises a plexiglass container filled with soybean oil to represent normal breast tissue, with a small balloon filled with diacetin solution to represent the tumour. Both uncalibrated and calibrated measurements of reflection coefficient magnitude and phase were performed. The microwave source comprised an open-ended rectangular waveguide operating in the frequency range of approximately 8.2 to 12.4 GHz. Calibrated measurements were performed using a slotted waveguide system. An in-depth analysis between calibrated measurements and simulation results for a simple dielectric structure is illustrated to verify the simulation results. Then, calibrated measurements for breast phantom are obtained. Finally, a theoretical-versus-experimental qualitative assessment for the breast phantom verifies the mathematical model developed in the thesis. Thus, a near-field microwave non-invasive detection prototype is designed to experimentally detect tumour presence via measuring the sensor’s aperture reflection coefficient.","bibo:AuthorList":["Saleh, Wael Mouin","Wright, David"],"dc:date":"2007-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Whilst work related issues have been shown to prompt the majority of migrations, the role of extended kin deserves further attention. Plakans and Wetherell found that, the ‘placing [of the] domestic group within a larger kin context’, seen as the next logical research step as long ago as the 1970s, was an issue that remained largely unaddressed in 2003. Here the impact of the extended family, on migration decisions and the likelihood of residential persistence, is investigated. \n\nEvidence for community cohesion has been sought and kinship links have been investigated; both have been found to influence the residential patterns of individuals. This research has revealed that, whilst economics may provide the impetus for a move, cultural factors and the role of non-resident kin played a far greater part in the decision to migrate, or not, than most previous studies have acknowledged. It has been shown that, although kinship impacted upon both, reasons for emigration were very different from those for migration. The substantial role played by religious belief, not only as a motivation for the emigration of extended family groups, but also as an issue influencing the choice of destination, is a particular feature of the findings of this study.\n\nIn 1994, Pryce and Drake were ‘making a strong plea for the adoption of rigorous intellectual approaches in migration research’ and the methods used here address this appeal. A technique of total reconstruction and longitudinal tracing has been employed in order to investigate the inhabitants of three small areas of North Devon. A comprehensive range of sources has been used and an in-depth examination of exemplar migrants and the residentially persistent, has allowed possible motivations to be scrutinised. In this way, the details of the structures and processes observed become clearer. In the context of family reconstitution, Barry Reay wrote of ‘a dearth of such studies of nineteenth-century England’ and it is intended that the methods used in this research will facilitate a wider understanding of the factors that motivated migrants in Victorian rural England. \n\nWhilst considering the influences of kin and community on migration patterns in the three study areas, the relative roles of other factors have been taken into account. It has been necessary to look at economic patterns and to investigate how, for example, farming and fishing, and any nineteenth century changes therein, affected the lives of the inhabitants. In an area where, and at a time when, non-conformist religion took a particular hold, the effect that the faith of these individuals had on their decisions to move, or stay put, has been assessed. Thus, the issues of faith, fish, farm and family are all borne in mind when studying the motivations for the migration decisions of the inhabitants of the three settlements.","bibo:AuthorList":["Few, Janet Mary","Deacon, Bernard"],"dc:date":"2009-09-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Following\nthe theoretical sampling study and literature search, it became clear that no major\ndifferences seemed to be evident between the learning and change in both groups of\ntherapists. I therefore constructed a model of general therapist learning and change from\nthe findings of the grounded theory study. This model details the ways in which\ncounsellors and psychotherapists learn and change both personally and professionally as a\nresult of their work with clients. It also refers to the change process, difficult aspects of\nworking as a therapist and other catalysts of learning and change for therapists.\nFor the CSSI, I studied my own and a co-researcher’s learning and change experiences,\nwhich were recorded in journals over a period of 9 months. The findings of this study\ncomplement those of the grounded theory study by providing further insight into the ways\nin which learning experiences occur for therapists.\nI have linked my findings to some of the literature on education and learning, as well as the\nliterature on transformative learning, and have discussed their implications for practice,\ntraining and supervision in counselling and psychotherapy.

The appropriateness of socio-cultural theories in language teaching and learning today stems from social constructivist and social interactionist theories of the role of language in the discursive construction of society, knowledge and power.  This study problematised  these constructs in the development of writing for learners in a pre-university Higher Education context.  Comparing data from focal students who were struggling with writing and from students who were more successful, the biographies of struggling students and their awareness of their futures, or imagined selves and communities, revealed not only learning histories in which they had radically different identities as learners and writers, but also a lack of clarity about their learning trajectory in the writing program.  There was no apparent lack of investment in learning among the focal students, who identified themselves as weak writers, although there was frustration and anger at their predicament.  The data suggest that they did not identify with the learning community at the start of the project, probably because they resisted belonging to a community which labeled them as failures. During the study a variety of means were used to elicit participants’ perceptions of their status as novice writers and to support their learning trajectory on an individual basis by elucidating the reasons for and requirements of academic writing. By the end of the study the focal students had developed more awareness of the subject positions the writing trajectory afforded them and had chosen ways in which to continue along their learning path.  The Community of Practice appears to have potential as a means of supporting the roles of EAP students and teachers as members of the academic community of practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Howell, Elizabeth","Rich, Sarah","Cadorath, Jill"],"dc:date":"2008-11-24","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The research participants provide insights about community formation and function in a virtual domain where they work together at a distance without meeting face-to-face.  The study appears to be a new application of culture code methodology, symbolic interactionism and social learning theory as they conjoin on social, psychological and organizational levels. To my knowledge it is the first study of an MBA virtual community of practice.\nResearch interviews were conducted primarily by distance using web-based technology, teleconferences and email, as well as some face to face discussion.  The central questions are:  1) To what extent does a distributed faculty team in an online global business management course constitute a community of practice?  2) What is the nature of faculty relationships in the online global business management course? and 3) What are the leadership issues in a virtual practice setting?  Findings reveal that online community practitioners are resourceful in creating peer leadership that is embedded within the group and its relationships.  \nThe study is motivated by my personal interests and professional experience, as well as by the quest of online colleagues for ways to assess, support and improve themselves and their practice.  Building on personal experience as an online business communications instructor, the thesis presents an example of peer leadership in a virtual global business community of practice and in its completion stands as a case study.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ross, Jack John Wesley","MacDonald, Malcolm","Rose, Jo"],"dc:date":"2009-12-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The study used a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methodologies including a self-esteem survey administered to pupils in the two case-study classrooms as well as to students in two control classrooms (N\u003d47) at the beginning and end of the school year.  Throughout the course of the year a series of semi-structured interviews was also conducted with six focus children selected from each class (2 high, 2 medium and 2 low self-esteem children) as well as with the two class teachers and the parents/step-parents of the focus children. In addition, the study included non-participant observation which focussed on the participation and behaviour of the focus children during PSCE lessons and other lessons through the use of  three separate observation schedules. \n\nThe study found evidence of the important influence of significant others, in particular, parents, peers and teachers, on the focus children’s self-esteem. Although the quantitative analysis of the self-esteem questionnaires showed no statistically significant increase in self-esteem at the group level over time, the qualitative findings indicate that teachers’ relationship with their students, their promotion of responsibility and self-efficacy, and their careful implementation of PSCE practices contributed to increases in individual children’s self-esteem. There was also evidence that the implementation of PSCE activities contributed to improvements in children’s peer relations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mary, Latisha Marie","Holden, Cathie","Haynes, Gill"],"dc:date":"2010-01-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The ensuing problem for the post-war generations of having to claim a past that was buried under the carefully constructed official version of history but mediated through the silence of their parents and grandparents – shaping their (inner) lives – and possibilities for representing such experience through the medium of theatre are core issues explored in this study. The main focus of the dissertation is analysis of a selection of three pieces of theatre produced by two free theatre companies in Austria, Auf der Suche nach Jakob / Searching for Jacob / Szukajac Jakuba, and Pola, both by the Projekttheater Studio based in Vienna, and Speaking Stones: images, voices, fragments… from that which comes after  by Theater Asou in Graz, Styria. Apart from contextualization of the central thematic concerns of the selected pieces of theatre within the historical events of 20th century Austria, and discussion of the theoretical framework within which the pieces are analysed, this study also offers a consideration of the phenomenon of the free theatre sector in contemporary Austria as a complement and an alternative to the state theatre sector, its roots and development since the post WWII period through to the early 21st century. Interviews with theatre artists, arts administrators and a Holocaust eye witness are also drawn upon to investigate how free theatre can provide a medium though which memory-work, the subtleties of damage and the inexpressible, and the difficult task of claiming the past can be explored.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cronin, Bernadette Joan","Zarrilli, Phillip B."],"dc:date":"2009-11-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The defining characteristic of\nblowflies is the need for their larval stages to feed on a proteinaceous substrate,\noften including the tissues of a living vertebrate host, a process known as myiasis.\nWhile the evolution of myiasis has been linked to the development of key\nadaptations in behaviour and physiology (Stevens et al., 2006), patterns of blowfly\nevolution suggest that parasitism evolved independently in different blowfly groups\nafter periods of geographic isolation (Stevens et al., 2006).\nHowever, understanding the origin and evolution of myiasis in Calliphoridae\nis restricted by a lack of agreed theories of evolutionary relationships and\ntaxonomic classification (Stevens, 2003). Mitochondrial genes are some of the\nmost widely used molecular markers in insect systematics, yet most studies have\nutilised only single genes, with few having systematically assessed which if any are\nbest suited for studying particular insect orders. Accordingly, this thesis presents a\ncomprehensive analysis of 62 hexapod mitochondrial genomes, including 55 from\nInsecta, and assesses the ability of mitochondrial genes to recover currently\nrecognised insect orders as monophyletic groupings. The greatest amount of\nphylogenetic signal was recovered when all mitochondrial genes were analysed\ntogether, regardless of optimality criterion used (PhyML, RaxML, MrBayes). Of the\nsingle-gene analyses, COX1 out-performed all other genes, even performing as\nwell as a combined-gene analysis under Bayesian inference. In view of this finding,\nnucleotide sequence data from COX1 (mitochondrial protein-coding), EF-1α\n(nuclear protein-coding gene), and 28S (nuclear rRNA) were combined to present\none of the most comprehensive multi-gene phylogenetic studies of Calliphoridae to\ndate, resolving many ambiguous relationships, and also including several taxa that\nhave not previously been analysed in molecular phylogenetic studies.\nWithin Calliphoridae, Cochliomyia hominivorax (New World screwworm fly),\nis widely considered one of the most destructive insect parasites of livestock in the\nWestern hemisphere. While successful eradication programmes using sterile\ninsect technique (SIT) have been completed in North and Central America, and on\nsome Caribbean islands, in some areas SIT has failed. It has been hypothesized\nthat failure of SIT may be related to genetic differentiation between populations of C.\nhominivorax. Consequently, intra-specific variation using nucleotide sequence data\nfrom both mitochondrial (COX1 and 12S) and nuclear (EF-1α) markers, was\nexplored. Phylogenetic analysis of these data confirmed some population substructuring\nand suggested a South American origin to all Caribbean island\npopulations, with the exception of Cuba. In agreement with previous studies,\nCuban populations appeared distinct from all other Caribbean populations; however,\nour findings do not support a North American origin for Cuba, as has previously\nbeen suggested.\nFinally, this thesis attempted to explore the relationship between antigenic\nproteins expressed in larvae from species displaying different forms of parasitism,\nand in doing so assessed the utility of such target proteins as potential candidates\nfor species-specific vaccines and diagnostic tools. However, while this work\ndiscovered distinct antigenic profiles for different blowfly species, the ability to\ncharacterize specific antigens was fundamentally limited by an apparent lack of\nhomologous proteins in current databases.","bibo:AuthorList":["McDonagh, Laura","Stevens, Jamie"],"dc:date":"2009-09-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Spatial patterns of the abundance of reef resources, but also of the processes that govern reef recovery after disturbance, need to be mapped at relevant scales to identify priority conservation measures. In this thesis I took important steps towards the construction of adequate tools for reef managers: towards creating maps of reef resilience.  The first step comprised the accuracy enhancement of thematic maps to discriminate typical forereef habitats that differ in their structural complexity. The second step consisted of the creation of statistical models to predict spatial patterns of the density and biomass of several fish species including grazers. To date, fish species richness can be mapped but not the spatial patterns of abundance or biomass of key species of reef fish. Here, I demonstrate that it is possible to predict spatial patterns of the abundance of key species of grazers across large scales on Caribbean reefs by mapping their acoustic roughness. The third and fourth steps focused on improving our understanding of the process of parrotfish grazing on Pacific reefs. I created models to predict the grazing impact of populations of grazers from their abundance data incorporating sources of spatio-temporal variability in their grazing behaviour. Although grazing of Pacific parrotfish communities is a subject of growing concern and several aspects of its dynamics are well understood on the Great Barrier Reef, this thesis contributes with two major future goals: (1) to rank Micronesian parrotfish species according to their relative contribution to grazing impact and (2) to aid the generation of maps of grazing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bejarano Chavarro, Sonia","Mumby, Peter"],"dc:date":"2009-12-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The synthesis of these data with recent tectonic reconstructions suggest the character of igneous rocks and mineral deposits was controlled by two periods of ocean ridge subduction and contemporaneous slab steepening and flattening.\nMineralisation occurred in four epochs: (1) Eocene ~ 43 to 38 Ma Cu (Au) skarn and porphyry deposits in northeastern Mexico; (2) Miocene, ~18 to 9 Ma Cu (Au) porphyry, skarn and high-sulphidation epithermal deposits in the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) and Oaxaca; (3) Pliocene ~ 4.5 Ma low-sulphidation epithermal deposits in the TMVB; and (4) Pliocene to Pleistocene ~ 2.5-2.0 Ma Cu (Au) skarn and porphyry deposits in Chiapas. The intrusions of the Eocene and Miocene epochs are high-K, have adakite-like geochemistry including Sr/Y up to ~108 and ~85 respectively and La/Yb ratios up to ~38 and ~27 respectively, and were followed by alkaline magmatism. All episodes of mineralisation are interpreted to have occurred above areas of slab steepening following periods of flat slab subduction.\nShallow emplacement of Miocene ~ 9.0-8.0 Ma diorite stocks in the TMVB caused flashing of hydrothermal fluids, banded quartz vein formation and Au deposition which overprint potassic alteration and Cu-Au mineralisation. Barren quartz-alunite zones formed contemporaneously with potassic alteration at higher elevations. Later fluids deposited Au in some quartz-alunite zones. \nThere is little difference in Pb isotope compositions of feldspar and sulphides or variation over time, their compositions ranging from 18.3208 to 19.1637 for 206Pb/204Pb, 15.4541 to 15.6675 for 207Pb/204Pb and 38.3096 to 39.2193 for 208Pb/204Pb.

Work in the sociology of culture, sociology of arts and sociology of music has focused on cultural consumption, including music, as bound up in the reflexive projects by individuals and groups to constitute and reconstitute their social reality. Within my research I focus on the creation of cultural artefacts, in this case ‘works’ in the Western art music tradition, as central to processes of aesthetic agency where composers are engaged in reflexive projects of constituting and reconstituting their social reality and acting within those constructs.\n\nTo begin the opening historical chaper, ‘Mortification of Modernism’, uses Goffman’s work in Asylums (1968) to contextualize the cultural policies and activities of the Weimar Republic, considered the classical era of modernism, as a home world from which those involved in modernist ventures developed presenting cultures supported by bespoke institutions established in the early post WWI years. During the waning years of the Republic and the rise of National Socialism, these support structures, including the individuals that made up the cooperative networks of modernism, were destroyed removing most connections to the Weimar Republic modernist home world. In the first years of the Third Reich through numerous denunciations, dismissals, policies, etc. the presenting culture of Weimar modernists was mortified through abasements, degradations and humiliations. Having identified – through qualitative mapping of concert programmes, music reviews and festival participation – composers involved in modernist circles in the Weimar Republic, their career paths and compositional outputs were traced throughout the years of the Third Reich to interrogate the aesthetic agency of composers in light of significant situational and perspectival incongruity.\n\nThe dissertation then considers each of five composers in depth in separate chapters – Paul Hindemith, Rudolf Wagner-Regeny, Ernst Pepping, Heinrich Kaminski and Wolfgang Fortner. The five were selected based on four criteria: a high degree of activity in Weimar modernist circles (festivals, concerts, societies); continued presence in Germany for a significant portion of the Third Reich; continued professional activity as composers during the Third Reich; access to relevant source material both secondary (biographies, reviews, stylistic analyses, etc.) and primary (scores, letters, diaries, authored texts, etc.) from the subjects. The data illumines complex repertoires of adaptive strategies these individuals engaged in – with, through and to musical products – and how music is not only shaped by wider socio-cultural contexts, but how its construction is a primary resource for agents to respond to and structure the socio-cultural contexts around them. Key findings include the constitution of music as resource for showing both complicity with and subversion against the Nazi Kulturpolitik; as a resource for proxy presence in multiple social spaces (private homes, concert halls, opera houses, etc.) affording the construction and dissemination of composer identity and philosophy; as a technology of self for personal therapy; and in total as a resource for weltanschauung - world-building activity where composers construct and re-construct their social realities through musical creation – music as an active tool in and reflexive resource for individual social reality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sutherland, Ian","DeNora, Tia"],"dc:date":"2009-10-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Careful attention has been paid to the convergence, acceleration and optimisation of the code. \n\nI present the results of the application of the code to various benchmarking scenarios, including a collapsing cloud, a circumstellar disc and a very optically thick cloud of interstellar water. Benchmarking is an essential step in verifying the accuracy and efficiency of the code which is vital if it is to be used to analyse real data. In all cases, the code was able to accurately reproduce either the expected analytical solution or (in the absence of such a solution) was able to produce results commensurate with the results of other codes.\n\nIn order to facilitate the motivating radiative transfer calculations of a star-forming cluster simulated using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) performed in this thesis, it was first necessary to devise and test an algorithm that efficiently maps an irregular distribution of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) particles onto a regular adaptive mesh. Whilst the algorithm was designed with this in mind it has also been used to study the effects of radiative feedback in circumstellar discs as well create a synthetic survey of a simulated galaxy.\n\nBate et al.\u0027s particle representation was resampled onto an adaptive mesh to enable me to use TORUS to obtain non-LTE level populations of multiple molecular species throughout the cluster and create velocity-resolved datacubes by calculating the emergent intensity using raytracing. I compared line profiles of cores traced by N2H+ (1-0) to probes of low density gas (13CO and C18O (1-0)) surrounding the cores along the line-of-sight. The relative differences of the line-centre velocities were found to be small compared to the velocity dispersion, matching recent observations. The conclusion is that one cannot reject competitive accretion as a viable theory of star formation based on observed velocity profiles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rundle, David","Harries, Timothy J."],"dc:date":"2010-07-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It endeavours to do this through presentation, analysis and discussion of two empirical studies of leadership, informed by distributed and practice perspectives, which regard leadership as a shared and contextually situated social process.  The thesis begins with an overview of leadership theory and research, proposing that the time is right for a reframing of the field of leadership studies in order to redress the balance accorded to individual and collective accounts of leadership; review how we recognise, reward and develop leadership; and revisit our methodologies and approaches to leadership enquiry.  The first empirical study investigates perceptions and experiences of leadership in the UK higher education sector, proposing that whilst leadership may be considered as widely dispersed, the notion of ‘distributed leadership’ also carries a powerful rhetorical function that may mask an uneven distribution of power, resources and rewards.  The second empirical study explores the notion of ‘leadership-as-practice’ in three large, complex organisations outside the HE sector, and reveals the significant impact of discourse and sensemaking in shaping perceptions, experiences and the accomplishment of leadership for middle-senior level operational managers.  The discussion chapter draws together the various themes explored in the thesis, in particular demonstrating the significance of issues of discourse, identity and purpose in making sense of the elusive nature of leadership practice.  It is argued that a holistic representation of leadership remains difficult to achieve because of the manner in which grand Discourses and micro-level discourses of leadership interact to attribute the social process of leadership to the actions of individual leaders. The thesis concludes with a series of recommendations that highlight the value of a somewhat eclectic approach to leadership theory, research, practice and development that facilitates the emergence and recognition of contextually-appropriate ‘hybrid configurations’ of leadership.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bolden, Richard Ian","Gosling, Jonathan","Schroeder, Jonathan"],"dc:date":"2010-02-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The central argument the present thesis seeks to demonstrate is that the Lacanian-Althusserian dialectic provides a more comprehensive and effective account of the process of the subject formation than a purely psychoanalytical or structuralist Marxist analysis of the term. After a critical study of the way the subject is positioned between language and ideology in contemporary critical theory the thesis proceeds to investigate the subject-object relation in the Cartesian and Hegelian subjects.  \n     Conceived of as the convergence of lack and material, the Lacanian-Althusserian dialectic focuses on the close affinity between the Lacanian notion of linguistic alienation and the Althusserian concept of ideological interpellation. The subject’s alienation with what is called in the thesis ‘ideological signifier’ is considered as the result of direct and dramatic modes of interpellation in both language acquisition process and the mature phase. The major theoretical premises of this model include the following: first, identity functions through, and because of, the ‘inter-subjective dialectic’ and an ‘intra-subjective lack.’ Identity is never fully constituted because of this antagonism, and thus remains ‘incomplete.’ Secondly, the subject is ideologically constituted through language. The mechanism through which both language and ideology construct a subject never permits the subject enjoying a state of full identity with ideological signifiers. Thirdly, the subject’s identity is represented in the language exposed to and, later, reproduced by him/her.\n    In order to demonstrate a practical reading of subjectivity formation in terms of this critical approach the present research applies it to James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916). The process of the subject formation has been analysed through the subject’s alienation/interpellation by the ISAs. Also, the inter-subjective dialectic between different subjectivities of the subject’s identity has been investigated. The thesis demonstrates that identity reconstruction represented in the novel is a complicated and ongoing process, which begins with disillusionment, goes through materialization of epiphany, and ends with inventiveness in language. This process has been represented as a move from ideological to non-ideological subjectivity through artistic creativity. The exploration of the aesthetics of language is crucial to the analysis of the reconstruction of Stephen Dedalus’ identity in that it happens in and through language.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sadjadi, Seyed Bakhtiar","Murray, Alex"],"dc:date":"2010-06-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The majority of statistical models developed to\ncharacterise recurrent events are derived from either\nreliability theory or survival analysis. This thesis concentrates on\napplications that arise from reliability, which in general involve\nthe study about components or devices where the recurring\nevent is failure.\n\nSpecifically, interest lies in repairable components that\nexperience a number of failures during their lifetime. The goal is to\ndevelop statistical models in order to gain a good understanding\nabout the driving force behind the failures. A particular counting\nprocess is adopted, the non-homogenous Poisson process (NHPP),\nwhere the rate of occurrence (failure rate) depends on time. The\nprimary application considered in the thesis is the prediction\nof underground water pipe bursts although the methods described have\nmore general scope.\n\nFirst, a Bayesian mixed effects NHPP model is developed and applied to a\nnetwork of water pipes using MCMC. The model is then extended\nto a mixture of NHPPs. Further, a special mixture case, the\nzero-inflated NHPP model is developed to cope with data\ninvolving a large number of pipes that have never failed. The\nzero-inflated model is applied to the same pipe network.\n\nQuite often, data involving recurrent failures over time, are\naggregated where for instance the times of failures are unknown\nand only the total number of failures are available. Aggregated\nversions of the NHPP model and its zero-inflated version are\ndeveloped to accommodate aggregated data and these are applied to\nthe aggregated version of the earlier data set.\n\nComplex devices in random environments often exhibit what may be\ntermed as state changes in their behaviour.

A hidden semi-Markov NHPP model is\nformulated, which is a NHPP process modulated by an unobserved semi-Markov process.\nAn algorithm is developed to evaluate the likelihood of this model and a\nMetropolis-Hastings sampler is constructed for parameter estimation.

This thesis provides an exemplification on the measure of damages in the carriage of goods by sea in both countries. It will help practitioners as well as scholars from both countries to understand the peculiar features and dynamics of the topic in the other’s shipping laws.\nThe Chinese law of damages and shipping law are not as detailed or as well-structured as its English counterpart. Over the years, some articles in the Chinese Maritime Code (CMC) have been interpreted inconsistently, e.g., art.55, and there is contradiction among different laws on the said topic, resulting in considerable confusion about the law. Bizarre and arguably unjust applications of legal rules continue to surface in claims for damages. A large number of contradictory decisions have been produced in Chinese shipping cases. Similar heads of damages are accepted or rejected in a process which at times seems alarmingly random. It is time to revisit the CMC and the law of damages and to urge their reform. England is a well-established centre of shipping litigation and arbitration in the world and its shipping laws are more influential on Chinese maritime courts than those of any other country. Several senior Chinese scholars suggest that English law is the model on which the reformed CMC should be based. \nThis thesis is written with a view to encouraging a revision of the defects in the CMC and to changing aspects of the current Chinese law of damages. It expounds on the English law part, provides a principled explanation for legal rules in cargo claims, reviews relevant Chinese law, makes comparisons between English and Chinese law at length, addresses the problems in Chinese shipping law and seeks a solution. It is hoped that this thesis can provide instructive recommendations to Chinese lawmakers and clarify the chaos inherent in interpreting the relevant law. In a few aspects, Chinese law seems fairer than the English position, which English scholars may find refreshing and enlightening. This thesis also proposes to increase the awareness of national decision-makers, especially the Chinese, of the international tenor of existing and proposed international maritime laws, as well as the concomitant duty to interpret and implement them as such.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fan, Wei","Tettenborn, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2008-10-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

By correctly considering realistic\nMTJ parameters, the key result was found to be the correct handling of the effective\nmasses in of the three MTJ layers. The extracted barrier-heights of 3.5-4eV is much\nhigher than found previously and closer to the half band-gap result expected. It is then\nclear that the correct treatment of the parameters produces a far more realistic result.\nThe key parameter which can be extracted from the I-V characteristics is the product\nb\nm*d V , where m* is the effective mass of the barrier, d is the effective barrier\nthickness and Vb is the effective barrier height.\nThe analytic solution is a transparent model in which the key material\nparameters are visible and simple enough to be applied by experimental researchers to\nMTJs. The accurate modelling of both the prefactor and exponent are crucial to\nestimating the TMR.

The calculation is\nbased on the free-electron-like numerical solution providing a functional dependence of\nthe TMR. The results were found to be in excellent agreement with the ab initio models\nand experiment. Furthermore a simplified analytic expression shows the TMR is\ndependent on the band-widths of the tunnelling electron states, the coupling and the\nthickness of the barrier.

Therefore the intention of this thesis was to provide empirical evidence to advance the scientific knowledge and understanding of the phenomenon of EIMD; principally by investigating the physiological, perceived exertion and metabolic responses to the performance of dynamic exercise with EIMD.  The eccentric, muscle-damaging exercise protocol employed for all four studies involved participants completing 100 squats performed as 10 sets of 10 repetitions with the load on the bar corresponding to 70% of the individual’s body mass.  Measures of markers of muscle damage were taken before and after the eccentric exercise protocol in each of the four studies.  The markers used were plasma creatine kinase activity, isokinetic peak torque and perceived muscle soreness.  Cycling rather than running was used as the dynamic exercise mode in studies 1, 2 and 4 in order to avoid the confounding influence of alterations in gait subsequent to EIMD.  The dynamic exercise in study 3 was performed inside a whole body scanner and was therefore limited to knee extension and flexion.  \n\nThese four studies have provided novel insights into the influence of eccentric, muscle-damaging exercise on the human response to the performance of dynamic exercise.  We have demonstrated for the first time that following EIMD, the enhanced ventilatory response to dynamic exercise is provoked by stimuli unrelated to the blood lactate response, and that this enhanced ventilation may provide an important cue to inform the perception of effort.  Furthermore, we have shown that the reduced time to exhaustion observed following EIMD is associated with an elevated perception of exertion and increases in [Pi] during dynamic exercise.  Finally, we have demonstrated that the   kinetic response is unaltered during the transition to high intensity dynamic exercise.  Changes in [HHb] kinetics indicate that compensatory mechanisms act to preserve blood-myocyte O2 flux in the face of microvascular dysfunction, resulting in the unaltered   observed across the rest-to-exercise transition.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, Rosemary Carolyn","Rowlands, Ann V"],"dc:date":"2010-05-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Narrative, Perception and Identity","bibo:abstract":"Cornwall is a peripheral rural location in the South West of the UK, and has experienced almost continual socio-economic decline for more than a century.  It has a nationalist heritage and is a popular tourist resort.  It is also one of the poorest parts of the UK.  Academic work has addressed poverty in Cornwall, but has failed to adequately answer why various development programmes have not improved the economy.  Part of the reason for this may be that traditional approaches to regional development utilise identity politics as a development tool, and yet lack sufficient attention to the lived experience of local residents.  This work takes the opposite approach, seeking to address this omission by using narratives of identity to understand why Cornwall is still so poor.  \n\nSupporting data uses a qualitative, grounded methodology, using interviews to explore how decision makers and members of the public construct Cornwall.  The research finds that policy is based on a perception of the region which lacks a foundation in lived reality for local residents, and which carries a number of implications.  The area and its inhabitants are constructed as being a lifestyle choice, impacting on economic activity and the kinds of investment attracted, which has a negative impact on long term economic growth.  The solution proposed is that successful development needs to use a politics of identity that incorporates the realities of life in Cornwall, rather than emphasising an idealised perception.

It is noted that the danger in dangerous cargoes was not necessarily something in the goods themselves, but might well lie in the way they were packaged, looked after or transported. Accordingly, the responsibilities and liabilities of the various parties with regards to the carriage of dangerous cargoes are usually intertwined and complex.\n\nThe purpose of this thesis is to analyse and evaluate the dangerous cargoes liabilities in English and Chinese law, by providing suggestions for existing problems in each country based on three sources: contract, tort and statute. Moreover, the chain of causation and concept of remoteness has particular importance in order to establish liability and decide which type and what amount of damage is recoverable. \n\nThis thesis compares both countries’ liability regimes and how to secure compensation for its victims, and the restoration of the environment, with reference to the EU Environmental Liability Directive and relevant international conventions.

This thesis covers three main sets of experimental work as well as details of the experimental methods (chapter 2) used and the background theory behind the observed results (chapter 1). \n\nThe first experimental results presented in this thesis in chapter 3 focus on contactless measurement of the equilibrium magnetisation of sample A2268, a ten layer multiple quantum well sample. Fitting the shape of dHvA oscillations at various temperatures to different models for the density of states, various properties of the system can be estimated, such as the shape of the disorder-broadened density of states and the presence of a background density of states between the Landau levels.\n\nChapter 4 focuses on measurements of the decay of induced circulating currents in the quasi-dissipationless quantum Hall regime in two samples, V0049 and T73. The induced current is measured via contactless measurement of the associated magnetic moment. The magnitude of the induced current is found to be affected by the sweep rate of the magnetic field and also the distance of approach. The decay of the induced currents is observed at several temperatures and for different magnetic field sweep rates and distances of approach. Decays are observed for up to several days at time, far longer than previously possible. Information about the rate of decay can be used to build a picture of the decay mechanisms present in the quantum Hall regime. The presence of a power-law decay regime indicates many decay mechanisms contribute to the decay of a circulating current in the quasi-dissipationless quantum Hall regime. \n\nChapter 5 focuses on both contactless magnetometry and transport experiments carried out on a graphite sample. The experiments aim to confirm or dispute recent claims of Dirac fermions in graphite. Experiments are carried out at temperatures in the range 30 mK to ~4 K and at two different angles to the applied magnetic field. Phase analysis of both Shubnikov de Haas and de Haas van Alphen oscillations is used to distinguish between normal and Dirac fermions. Observation of quantum Hall effect displays the presence of a half-integer quantum Hall staircase similar to that observed in graphene.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kershaw, Tristan","Usher, Alan"],"dc:date":"2008-08-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Recent advances in the area of perceived exertion have led to novel applications in the use of the ratings of perceived exertion scale as a means of predicting an individual’s maximal functional capacity (VO2max) for exercise (Eston, Lamb, Parfitt, \u0026 King, 2005; Eston, Faulkner, Mason, \u0026 Parfitt, 2006; Eston, Lambrick, Sheppard, \u0026 Parfitt, 2008; Faulkner, Parfitt, \u0026 Eston, 2007). Yet the utility of such procedures with low-fit individuals or children has received little or no research attention. As such, one aim of this thesis was to assess the efficacy of the ratings of perceived exertion in predicting the VO2max of low-fit men and women, and healthy children. It is often presumed that like adults, a child’s perception of exertion rises linearly with increases in exercise intensity, despite a limited amount research suggesting otherwise. Moreover, there is a lack of empirical evidence to suggest that children regulate their power output during a closed-loop exercise task in order to complete a given distance in the fastest time possible. Therefore, a further aim of this thesis was to explore the nature of the perceptual responses of young children across differing modes of exercise, and to examine whether children employ pacing strategies during running. In relation to this latter aim, it was of particular interest to explore pacing in relation to the ratings of perceived exertion during running, as the ratings of perceived exertion have been proposed as a key component of such a regulatory system during exercise (Tucker, 2009).\nThis thesis comprises a qualitative review of relevant literature, and six study chapters which were borne out of five empirical studies. The findings of studies 1 and 2 (chapters 3 \u0026 4, respectively) support the utility of the ratings of perceived exertion to estimate VO2max in low-fit men and women, during cycle ergometry exercise. Importantly, this has been shown from a single exercise test at a low-moderate exercise intensity, during either a step-incremental (study 1) or ramp-incremental (study 2) protocol. Studies 3 and 4 (chapters 5 \u0026 6, respectively) provide evidence to suggest that a child’s perception of exertion may rise linearly or curvilinearly in relation to increasing work, during either cycle ergometry or treadmill exercise. These studies support the utility of a unique, curvilinear, paediatric ratings of perceived exertion scale in obtaining accurate exertional responses from young children, across differing modes of exercise. In contrast to studies 1 and 2, study 5 (chapter 7) suggests that the novel means of predicting maximal functional capacity from submaximal ratings of perceived exertion in adults is inaccurate with young children. This was particularly evident in the low intraclass correlation coefficients and wide limits of agreement obtained between measured- and predicted VO2max, for both cycle ergometry and treadmill exercise. Study 6 (chapter 8) demonstrated that young children employ pacing strategies during an 800 m run, similar to adults, and that this improves with trial familiarisation. Moreover, the presence of other competitors has a detrimental effect on performance, particularly for girls.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lambrick, Danielle Marie","Eston, Roger G","Rowlands, Ann V"],"dc:date":"2010-03-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A Cultural Historical Activity Theory study of a disciplinary Inclusion room.","bibo:abstract":"This thesis presents an exploration of the nature, extent and characteristics of a disciplinary Inclusion Room (IR), from the perspectives of students and staff in a South West secondary school.  Over the past five years, this school has significantly reduced fixed term exclusions and improved school attainment against Local Authority averages.  This research presents an organisational response to a socio-cultural problem and the paradoxical lenses of social inclusion and discipline.      \nThe research uses Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) as a theoretical and methodological framework.  I explore inclusion and professionalism using the perspectives of nine students who entered disciplinary IR and nine staff who knew the students.  Inclusion constructs explored include participation, equality and diversity.  Professionalism is deliberated through a continuum of managerial control/discretionay judgement, individualistic models/collegial approaches and bureaucratic/continuous learning dimensions.  Mixed methods used include document analysis, an on-line questionnaire, student and staff interviews, visual timelines and observations of the students in classrooms.   \nThe analysis of IR considers primary, secondary and tertiary contradictions along with disciplinary rules, community and division of labour/power constructs amongst participants to develop a rich understanding of the context.  Exploratory data, in the form of a questionnaire, suggests that the students and staff broadly share understanding of inclusion policy, practice and culture in this school.  Interviews, further informed by examination of documents, student timelines and observations, show how a disciplinary IR is integrated into, and complements, educational processes; participation (being there), equality and diversity, within the school.  Professionalism is characterised by discretionary lenses, collegial working and continuous learning governed by problem solving to support that educational vision.  Findings from this work are generalisable as the research develops experience of the school in a naturalistic manner and is illustrative of expectations rather than formal predictions.  Nevertheless, schools can use the findings to consider how a disciplinary IR can complement educational processes through increasing participation, equality and diversity.  Goals for inclusion can be enhanced through collaborative partnerships and active, ongoing engagement amongst students and staff to develop the educational experience.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gilmore, Gwendoline Julia","Avramidis, Elias","Givens, Nick"],"dc:date":"2010-03-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The achievement of the PRU was externally acknowledged by the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) with a recently reported overall grade of 1 or ‘Outstanding’.  This exploratory study took a social constructionist approach and was informed by the methodology of illuminative evaluation.  This study explored the stories and experiences of pupils and staff using interviews, a focus group and video diaries for the pupils.  The analysis of these data was from a socio-cultural theoretical perspective.  The research data suggested that success was in a state of flux for all in the PRU.  For pupils there were personal transformations in their attitudes, behaviours and values.  Pupils’ social and emotional capital was increased by the ‘deep relationships’ that developed between pupils and staff.  The innovative approach to the curriculum allowed pupils to engage positively with education and featured lessons that were routinely based upon experiential learning.  This included weekly outdoor learning lessons which provided a rich context for informal learning to take place alongside the formal objectives.  Leadership and management appeared to be the keystone of the PRU success.  There was a clear well founded educational philosophy that was successfully articulated through the operational systems of the PRU.  All of these parts contributed to the holistic success of the PRU.  Findings from this case study are not generalisable due to its specificity to one particular setting and small number of participants.  However, ‘naturalistic generalisations’ may be arrived at by the reader.  For example, the reader may be able to apply some aspects of good practice, such as developing deep relationships, to their own context when working with those pupils who are, or have the potential to be, disaffected.","bibo:AuthorList":["Leather, Mark Frederick","Chedzoy, Susan M.","Avramidis, Elias"],"dc:date":"2009-11-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This involves an examination of the causes of intelligence development, its progress throughout 1930-1942, its rationale and modus operandi, and the pressures it faced. This time period permits us to assess how intelligence development was a product of the colonial government\u0027s response to the 1930 peasant uprising which came as such a shock to colonial security and how thereafter intelligence helped prevent popular hostility to the government from taking the form of an uprising. As a result, intelligence information was increasingly used to secure colonial power during the period of parliamentary reform in Burma in 1937. The thesis further examines the stresses that riots and strikes placed on colonial security in 1938, the so-called ‘year of revolution’ in Burma. The thesis then proceeds to consider how intelligence operated in the final years of colonial rule before the Japanese occupation of Burma in 1942.\nThis study is significant not only because very little work on the colonial security services in Burma exists for the period under review, but also because it reveals that intelligence was crucial to colonial rule, underpinning the stability of the colonial state and informing its relationship with the indigenous population in what remained, in relative terms at least, a colonial backwater like Burma. The argument that intelligence was pivotal to colonial governmental stability in Burma because of its centrality to strategies of population control departs from conventional histories of Burma which have considered the colonial army to have been the predominant instrument of political control and the most significant factor in the relationship between the state and society in colonial Burma. Rather it will be argued here that the colonial state in Burma relied on a functioning intelligence bureau which collected information from local indigenous officials and informers and employed secret agents to work on its behalf. This information was collated into reports for the government which then became integral to policy formulation. The primary source base for this work includes British colonial material from government and private collections predominantly in the British library as well as government papers in the National Archives in Kew.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clipson, Edmund Bede","Thomas, Martin"],"dc:date":"2010-01-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The aims of the thesis were based on the need to provide a possible explanation for the significant number of learners achieving low results, or failing their English language courses, in this programme.  \n\nIt was felt that a critical Jungian perspective could help uncover the existence in the Emirati tertiary system of both conscious and unconscious student resistance to English and of, synchronous, discursive forms of linguistic imperialism.  This notion was based on findings in the literature, principally in Analytical Psychology, which suggest that the individual psyche is composed of profound and powerful personal and collective unconscious elements as well as critical theory, which maintains that the language classroom cannot be extricated from the influence of surrounding political, or even geopolitical, forces.  The thesis sought, through the use of both a critical discourse analysis and critically-oriented case studies, to provide insight into the nature of the dialectical tension believed to exist, in this milieu, between the propagators of the language and those adopting it.  \n\nThe findings provided considerable evidence of a tension operating both at the discursive level and at the psychological level in the use of English in the foundation-year programme.  The findings suggested that the discourse presented to learners, from western textbook writers and editors, is heavily Anglo-Saxon in its use of motifs and topics and that there is room, at least on a macrostructural level, to offset this tendency and reconsider the cultural weighting of topical content so as to more appropriately cater to an Arabic and Muslim audience.  Also, the primary data revealed that the study’s participants were critical of the use of English as the university’s medium of instruction and there was consensus among them that a significant number of Emirati students, as well as some members of the public, were not receptive to the intrusion of this foreign language into their lives.  \n\nCritical Discourse Analysis and critical case studies were combined in the shaping of the research methodology and this enabled the researcher to gain an in-depth and qualitative insight into the nature of English propagation and adoption.  Key data collected from the research interviews was placed into a Jungian taxonomy and combined with the critical discourse analysis.  Upon examination, it provided the researcher with information, supported by relevant literature, that led to a number of recommendations directed, in particular, to language teachers (and publishers) regarding the need to shape discourse to cater to the cultural needs of the learners and to consider the psychological impact that the tertiary English language policy was having on the Arab student body.  \n\nThe thesis strongly maintains that the discursive content of the language materials delivered to such students needs to be more extensively adapted in order to cater to the student body so as to minimize, as much as possible, potential cultural alienation.  It also advocates the provision of Jungian psychological counseling in English language programmes because it would encourage policy makers to acknowledge the role of the unconscious in learning as well as provide invaluable support to language learners who are experiencing conscious or unconscious resistance to the English language in such a setting.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hill, Mark Richard","MacDonald, Malcolm","Burden, Robert"],"dc:date":"2009-12-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Empirical data is presented which builds upon existing literature within the Business Process Management (BPM) and Service Operations Management (SOM) disciplines. Adopting a theory building mode, the thesis concludes with the formulation of several research propositions which specify the design characteristics of the processes that provide the service concept to the customer.\nThe research addresses a number of gaps in the literature. First, there is little empirical evidence concerning the relationship between the service concept, customer inputs, and process design. Second, service classification schemes promote homogeneous thinking in the design of service systems delivering diverse service concepts. Third, the BPM literature provides generic process design principles which offer limited theoretical insights into the design requirements of operational processes. Finally, there is a need for process design research in information-intensive service organisations. \nA research framework that integrates theoretical models addressing service process design is investigated using a single case study approach. Fieldwork was carried out over a sixteen-month period in a large electricity supplier in the UK. In contrast to the macro-orientation found within the literature, this study employs a more granular level of analysis to address the unique requirements of ‘service concept – processes’ pairs. This approach results in a number of important findings which, in several instances, are in contradiction to current thinking. First, the results empirically validate the theoretical relationship between service concept, customer inputs, and process design. Different service concepts lead to different process designs, and the more customised the service concept, the more the process is uniquely designed. Significant differences in the design of the individual processes that collectively provide the service concept to the customer are highlighted. \nThe results also provide some new insights into the design of front office – back office activities as well as into the design characteristics of processes characterised by low customer contact. In addition, the study refutes the view that generic process design principles are universally applicable irrespective of the context in which the processes operate. Finally, the research findings show that a process-based view of service systems allows for heterogeneity; that is differences in the design of service delivery processes within the same organisation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ponsignon, Frédéric","Smart, Andi","Maull, Roger"],"dc:date":"2010-03-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Fairness and empowerment have emerged as central discourses for contemporary conceptualisations of development and governance, particularly in reference to the creation of alternative articulations to conventional/existent trading and economic practices.  These discourses have become stabilised into the now institutional discourses of Fairtrade and Black Economic Empowerment (BEE), yet both retain the capacity for resistance and changes to their understandings, practices, materialities and even the core premise which constitutes and is constituted by these.  By following four wine networks from South Africa to the UK, the changing ways in which Fairtrade and BEE were articulated through the network, interacting and responding to the changing contexts en route became apparent.  Indeed, this thesis is all about following - methodologically and theoretically - drawing a dynamic unfurling into the writing through a chronologically informed, non-chapter based structure, which follows the journey underlying the research.\nThrough the ethnographic interview methodology undertaken, contextuality, complexity and contingency emerged as critical to understanding the operations of the discourses within the wine networks and the power relations attendant on these.  A nuanced understanding of the significance of immutability in both discourse and power operations was developed that recognised the necessity of an overarching and stabilised core premise and regulator and yet simultaneous ground-level dynamism and multiplicity.  Without the latter, the wine networks are unable to enrol stakeholders, essential to the continuing performance demanded by their relational nature, because they need to be ever contextually relevant.  Wine itself presented a lens through which to understand the issues that this presents in the mismatch between common consumer associations between wine and Fairtrade, which means that the latter faces significant challenges to developing this particular ethical market.","bibo:AuthorList":["Herman, Agatha","Cloke, Paul","Goodwin, Mark"],"dc:date":"2010-01-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Maurice Souriau, and most recently Malcolm Cook have looked at his contributions during the French revolution. Both concluded that these were far more substantial than what some critics have hitherto claimed but neither of them conducted a systematic research in the newspapers of the time to see how his work was received. Nor did they consider the correspondence in this respect. This is what this thesis proposes to do. We originally intended to cover the years 1789 to 1799 but we discovered such a wealth of information concerning the first four years of the revolution that we decided to concentrate our research on that period. This ties in with Bernardin’s own publications since hardly anything new was published by him after 1792. This study has revealed that Bernardin had very strong political ideas which he expressed in 1789 with Vœux d’un solitaire and then again in 1792 with Suite des vœux d’un solitaire and in July of the same year he produced a poster entitled: L’Invitation à la Concorde pour la fête de la confédération au 14 juillet 1792. The first three chapters of this thesis analyse the reaction of the press and his correspondents to these publications. We then turn our attention to La Chaumière indienne, first published in 1791 and then again in 1792 where Bernardin included more notes concerning his views on the shape of the earth. If, by and large, the reception of this story was positive, his scientific views triggered enough commentary to justify a section of a chapter dedicated to them. As we progressed in our research, Bernardin’s importance at the time became increasingly evident and we realised that parallel to his own publications, ran an undercurrent of writings paying homage to the man and which we felt helped to build up a portrait of the period. We finish with his nomination as ‘Intendant du Jardin des Plantes’ in July 1792 which led him to write an appeal to create a zoo in the Jardin des Plantes. Throughout 1792 Bernardin’s name was rarely out of the newspapers. This study has shed new light on the persona of Bernardin and helped to underline his importance before, during and after the French revolution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jaffré-Cook, Odile","Wynn, Thomas"],"dc:date":"2009-10-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Through an analysis of the socio-political role of educational assessment I argue that the investigated issue may be considered as a privileged window that can provide a broad perspective from which I can observe how the participants of this study are positioned with respect to the role of mathematics education in the reproduction of unequal class relations. \nTo obtain answers to my assessment-related research questions, through a series of interviews I examine the teachers’ theoretical positions but in addition to that I observe their classroom cultures in the formation of which they play a protagonistic role. Through the teachers’ discourses and their annotated actions, I try to uncover the ways they respond to the contradictions and the dilemmas that might be posed to them by the given educational reality, as well as the tensions they might experience whenever they perceive the incompatibility of what they espouse and what they can achieve.\nMoving beyond the cognitive and psychological approaches that characterise most of research literature on teacher beliefs into the realm of ideology critique, I use Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis to depict teacher discourses as parts of social practices that are conditioned by social-historical factors and try to show what reproductive effects these discourses can have on social structures, sustaining them or contributing to their transformation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mouzakitis, Aristides","Skinner, Nigel"],"dc:date":"2009-10-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The design of a storm sewer system should be based on an appropriate level of preventing flooding. This thesis focuses on issues relevant to decision-making in storm sewer network design considering flood risk. \nUncertainty analysis is often required in an integrated approach to a comprehensive assessment of flood risk. The first part of this thesis discusses the understanding and representation of uncertainty in general setting. It also develops methods for propagating uncertainty through a model under different situations when uncertainties are represented by various mathematical languages. \nThe decision-making process for storm sewer network design considering flood risk is explored in this thesis. The pipe sizes and slopes of the network are determined for the design. Due to the uncertain character of the flood risk, the decision made is not unique but depends on the decision maker’s attitude towards risk. A flood risk based storm sewer network design method incorporating a multiple-objective optimization and a “choice” process is developed with different design criteria. \nThe storm sewer network design considering flood risk can also be formed as a single-objective optimization provided that the decision criterion is given a priori. A framework for this approach with a single objective optimization is developed. The GA is adapted as the optimizer. The flood risk is evaluated with different methods either under several design storms or using sampling method. \nA method for generating samples represented by correlated variables is introduced. It is adapted from a literature method providing that the marginal distributions of variables as well as the correlations between them are known. The group method is developed aiming to facilitate the generation of correlated samples of large sizes. The method is successfully applied to the generation of rainfall event samples and the samples are used for storm sewer network design where the flood risk is evaluated with rainfall event samples.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sun, Si\u0027ao","Djordjevic, Slobodan","Khu, Soon-Thiam"],"dc:date":"2010-07-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The three main research questions concerned what and how the children communicated through drawing, as well as drawing influences.  \n\nData were collected over one school year, in three seven-week research phases.  Spontaneous drawings from home and school were collected in scrapbooks and discussed with the children.  The class teacher and the children’s parents were interviewed and observations of the children drawing in class were also conducted.  These methods were repeated for each phase.  Nearly 800 drawings were analysed through a data-driven, iterative process where intersubjective understandings were emphasised.\n\nThe communicative potential of the children’s drawings was considerably broad, but one main theme (Identity) and two sub-themes (Power and Purpose) were visible in relation to the data.  Importantly, the drawings offered spaces for intellectual play and identity construction, where the children positioned themselves as competent and creative individuals.  The drawings were also shaped by a variety of shifting socio-cultural factors stemming from home, school, and elsewhere.  The implications of the study highlight the value of recognising drawing as a complex visual language that should be shared through verbal discussion.  \n\nAdditionally, a large-scale survey was conducted in order to gain a broad base of understanding about early years teachers’ beliefs, practices, and knowledge in relation to drawing.  The findings appeared to reflect the impact of the ‘‘mixed messages’’ in current educational policy, particularly in regard to the year group that teachers were teaching.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hall, Emese","Wood, Elizabeth","Young, Susan"],"dc:date":"2010-03-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Some types of physical activity can result in exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD), an occurrence which is well documented in adult populations. Symptoms of EIMD include increases in perceived muscle soreness, decrements in muscle strength and power, alterations in limb proprioception, increased myoprotein release, increased perceived exertion during exercise, and reduced endurance performance. Many strategies are currently employed in attempts to manage the symptoms of EIMD, though the majority are based on anecdotal or equivocal evidence. The aim of this thesis was to investigate a range of contemporary recovery strategies to determine their effectiveness and appropriateness for use with athletic populations. \n\nThis thesis comprises eight chapters:\n\n•\tChapter 1: Introduction\n•\tChapter 2: Review of Literature\n•\tChapter 3: Study 1 – Cold water immersion therapy as a recovery strategy following exercise-induced muscle damage\n•\tChapter 4: Study 2 – Manual massage as a recovery strategy following exercise-induced muscle damage\n•\tChapter 5: Study 3 – The use of compressive clothing as a recovery strategy following exercise-induced muscle damage\n•\tChapter 6: Study 4 – Does the use of manual massage therapy have an added beneficial effect on symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage when used in conjunction with compressive clothing?\n•\tChapter 7: Study 5 – Muscle strength loss characteristics at optimal and short muscle lengths following exercise-induced muscle damage\n•\tChapter 8: General discussion\n•\tChapter 9: Conclusion and recommendation for further study\n\nChapter 3 considers the efficacy of a single bout of cold water immersion therapy following strenuous exercise as a recovery strategy. The results indicate that this treatment protocol has no significant effect on moderating increases in soreness or creatine kinase activity, or reducing decrements in muscle function (p \u003e 0.05). Although this type of recovery strategy is popular in elite sporting fields, this study is consistent with a number of others, indicating that a single bout of cold water immersion therapy is an ineffective recovery strategy following EIMD.\n\nChapter 4 focuses on manual massage a post-exercise recovery strategy. Similar to cold water immersion therapies, the use of massage as a treatment is widespread within the athletic field, though few studies have considered its efficacy following EIMD. This study indicates that although no effect of massage was apparent on perceived soreness or creatine kinase activity, individuals receiving a thirty minute treatment immediately following damaging exercise demonstrated reduced decrements in muscle strength as assessed by isokinetic dynamometry (p \u003c 0.05). This chapter concludes that immediate manual massage may be an effective treatment strategy to manage some of the symptoms of EIMD.\n\nChapter 5 examines the use of clothing with specific compressive qualities as an increasingly popular method of managing symptoms of muscle damage, which is largely unsupported by scientific evidence. Following damaging exercise, the use of lower limb compression reduced decrements in isokinetic muscle function and jump performance, while moderating increases in perceived soreness. This chapter concludes that the use of lower limb compression clothing is an effective, non-invasive method of managing symptoms of EIMD.\n\nData collected from chapters 4 and 5 indicated that manual massage and lower limb compression may manage some of the symptoms of EIMD. Chapter 6 investigates whether these two recovery strategies used in combination have an additive beneficial effect on symptoms of muscle damage. Data from study 3 (chapter 5) were used to compare the combined treatment with the compressive treatment as an independent recovery modality. A significant beneficial effect was observed on perceived soreness as a result of combining the massage and compression treatments, in comparison with compression alone. No consistent benefits on muscle function, above those offered by compression independently were derived as a result of the combined treatment. This chapter concludes that although some benefits are afforded by the addition of massage to the compressive treatment with regard to perceived soreness, logistically, this combination of treatments is unlikely to provide a substantial enough benefit to warrant use with groups of athletes. \n\nExercise-induced muscle damage leads to losses of strength and alterations in the muscle length-tension relationship. Data collated from chapters 5 and 6 were used to investigate muscle strength loss characteristics following damaging exercise. Consistent with previous research, a disproportionate loss of muscle strength was observed at shorter muscle lengths, attributable to mechanical changes within the affected muscle. The use of isokinetic dynamometry was able to detect a shift in length-tension relationship in favour of a longer optimal muscle length for tension generation. The shift in length-tension relationship has been observed in previous studies, although no study has observed this shift in the knee extensor muscle group, and those considering the knee extensor group have inferred the shift as a result of the disproportionate nature of muscle strength loss. \n\nThe final chapter of this thesis uses data collected from chapters 3-6 to determine the variations in response to different types of eccentrically biased exercise. Typically, plyometric drop jumps elicited greater decrements in isokinetic muscle function and higher perceptions of soreness following exercise in comparison with either downhill running or vertical plyometric jumps. Downhill running resulted in greater cellular permeability as indicated by creatine kinase activity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jakeman, John Robert","Eston, Roger G","Byrne, Chris"],"dc:date":"2010-03-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The importance of parental involvement is recognised within NGs and research reveals positive social and emotional outcomes for children when NGs collaborate with parents as respected partners.  An implicit power imbalance between NG staff and parents can challenge parental collaboration.  \nThis aim of this paper is to evaluate outcomes when nurturing principles are consistent between a NG, schools and home.  \nA mixed methodology design with interpretative and scientific approaches was employed in an area NG in the south west of England.  An action-research model enabled consultation meetings and Video Interactive Guidance (VIG) to be introduced as an intervention to develop consistent practices for the experimental group.  Quantitative outcomes from Boxall Profiles and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQs) are compared pre- and post-intervention for an experimental group (4 children and 4 parents) and a control group (4 children). Three NG staff also volunteered as participants. Qualitative measures (observation records, semi-structured interviews (SSIs), consultation meetings and VIG clips) measured outcomes for the experimental group.  Data from the Boxall Profiles, SDQs, VIG clips and observations was analysed descriptively.  Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to analyse emergent themes from the SSIs and consultation meetings.  \nThe results revealed the experimental group made greater gains post-intervention as measured by the SDQ and the control group made greater gains post-intervention as measured by the Boxall Profile.  The majority of results for individual experimental group children revealed positive social and emotional outcomes post-intervention.  \nIt is difficult to draw conclusions when outcomes between the experimental and control group were compared. The majority of measures identified positive social, emotional and behavioural outcomes for experimental group children when parents and schools work collaboratively with NGs.    VIG and sharing of practices helped to modify how parents and teachers understood, managed, communicated and related to children.  \nRecommendations for practice discuss the development of personalised, informal and formal communication systems between settings while ensuring minimal anxiety for children.  VIG can be used effectively within NGs to develop consistent nurturing practices between settings.  Consideration is given to how VIG can be applied more broadly and how local authorities can support this process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rautenbach, Roosje Aimee","Maxwell, Tim","Richards, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2010-05-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The invention of that character, determining what qualities, qualifications, and behaviour befits a gentleman, preoccupied writers and thinkers throughout the eighteenth century.  This thesis traces the evolution of the masculine ideals – chivalry, republican virtue, professional merit – that informed what it meant to be a gentleman.  Because gentlemanliness had implications for citizenship and political rights, Defoe, Richardson, Rousseau, and the other men who sought to define gentlemanliness increasingly connected it and citizenship to gendered virtue rather than socio-economic status.  Women writers were equally concerned with the developing gentlemanly ideal and, as I will show, its political implications.  This thesis brings together masculinity studies and feminist literary history, but also combines the gendered social history that often frames studies of women’s writing with the political and military history traditionally associated with men.  Doody (1988) suggests that novels are influenced by three separate histories: “the life of the individual, the cultural life of the surrounding society, and the tradition of the chosen art” (9).  With the feminocentric novel, however, the historical context is often circumscribed by a concern for what is ‘feminine’ and what polite lady novelists might be responding to.  With the exception of women’s participation in the 1790s debates, eighteenth-century women writers have been seen as shying away from divisive political topics, including war.  However, I will show that masculinity is central to re-evaluating the ways in which women writers engaged with politics through the courtship plot, because, as McCormack (2005) stresses, “politics and the family were inseparable in Georgian England” (13).  Furthermore, as Russell (1995) observes, war is a cultural event that affects and alters “the textures of thought, feeling, and behaviour” (2-3).  Focusing on late-eighteenth-century wars, this thesis will explore how political and military events influenced masculine ideals – particularly independence – and how these changes were negotiated in women\u0027s novels.\nBeginning with Frances Burney, this thesis explores the ways in which women writers offered solutions to the problem of masculinity while promoting a (proto)feminist project of equality.  By rejecting chivalry and creating a model of manliness that builds on republican virtue and adopts the emerging professional ethic, women writers created heroes defined by personal merit, not accidents of birth.  Burney begins this process in Evelina (1778) before problematising the lack of manly independence in Cecilia (1782).  Charlotte Smith and Jane West take the problems Burney’s work exposes and offer alternatives to chivalric masculinity amidst the heightened concerns about liberty and citizenship surrounding the French revolution.  Finally, Maria Edgeworth’s and Jane Austen’s Napoleonic-era novels promote professionalism as a path to gentility but also as a meritocratic alternative to landed and aristocratic social models.   Though the solutions offered by these writers differ, in their opposition to chivalric masculinity they demonstrate that liberating men from the shackles of feudal dependence is essential to freeing women from patriarchal tyranny.","bibo:AuthorList":["Woodworth, Megan Amanda","Spencer, Jane"],"dc:date":"2008-06-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

No one political group, external or internal, has ever been able to present itself as the legitimate representative of the populace of Southern Sudan. These, however, were the objectives which the Sudan People‘s Liberation Movement (SPLM) sought to achieve from 2005 to 2010. The main contention of this thesis is that the success or failures of the SPLM at post-conflict state-building can be measured through the conceptual framework of legitimacy.\nAs a rebel movement, the SPLM fought a war of liberation against the government of Sudan from 1983 to 2004. Yet, the SPLM was not fighting for the secession of the South, as its predecessor had, but for the liberation of the country and for the creation of a ‗New Sudan‘ where all the politically marginalised groups of Sudan would be political equals. The movement based its rationale on a ‗revolutionary ideology‘, but this form of ideological legitimation was insufficient to gain Southern-wide support for its cause. The movement failed to establish rebel governance structures, was accused of abuses against the local population, and generally looked to external actors for support. Yet, through a peace agreement largely propelled forward by the United States, the SPLM ‗won‘ the war and was tasked with constructing a semi-autonomous state in Southern Sudan.\nThe successes or failures of the SPLM in developing the Government of Southern Sudan were largely dependent on its ability to create effective institutions and consolidate legitimacy. In order to accomplish this, the SPLM would have to shed its militaristic ethos and revolutionary ideology and thereby enable it to govern not as a rebel movement but as a political party. This, however, did not take place. The new Southern Government, which was supposed to be developed along the lines of a decentralised system of governance, remained centralised. The state and county governance institutions did not undergo the necessary capacity-building and were, subsequently, not able to provide for the security, development or welfare of the Southern populace. Thus, the government failed to consolidate eudaemonic legitimacy. In light of this shortcoming, government officials and the SPLM leadership promoted civic and revolutionary\n3\nideology as means to consolidate support. While ideological legitimation was successful to a certain extent, the majority of the Southern populace was illiterate and living in poverty; concepts such as democracy, civic responsibility or SPLM successes during in the peace process were not as appealing as the provision of basic services and development. Thus, the inability of the government to provide for the needs of the citizens jeopardised the attempts at ideological legitimation. As long as the government remained centralised and paralysed in providing for the welfare of the Southerners, it was unable to be considered as the true representative of the populace.","bibo:AuthorList":["Washburne, Sarah Lykes","Niblock, Tim"],"dc:date":"2010-05-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It summarizes representations of the child in history, science and literature, and reviews existing critical literature on the topic.\n\nThe study comprises six chapters.  The first looks at babies and young children, the second at Jude the Obscure, the third at Tess of the D’Urbervilles, the fourth at pregnant women and the fifth at the child within the family unit.  The final chapter uses close reading to provide a re-evaluation of two of Hardy’s ‘minor’ novels.\n\nEach chapter draws on specific historical contexts to reveal different aspects of the child myth.  The study as a whole looks at the different ways in which Hardy uses the myth.  At times he participates in it, or appears to, while at others he exposes it, or employs it to expose class and gender divisions in nineteenth century society.\n\nUltimately, Hardy acknowledges the power of the child myth in literature and in society, while simultaneously recognising it as a fallacy that is both inaccurate and dangerous.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pearce, Jessica Louise","Pearson, Maeve","Richardson, Angelique"],"dc:date":"2010-01-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Specifically, the study examines perceptions about the socialising effects of English-medium education from the standpoint of Arab-Muslim students at a Gulf Arab university. In assessing these perceptions, the study compares students’ perceptions on two levels: (i) on one level, it looks into students’ perceptions about the socialising effects of English-medium education in direct contrast to those of Arabic-medium education; and (ii) on another level, it contrasts the perceptions of English-medium students with those of Arabic-medium students.\nThe research for this thesis was carried out at an international bilingual Arab university in the United Arab Emirates. Data for the study was gathered from two data collection sources, namely student questionnaires and group interview sessions. In both instances, students’ perceptions were sought on a range of contrastive issues related to a series of underlying claims and assumptions about English-medium and Arabic-medium education. Overall, 365 Arabic-speaking students from both an English-medium and Arabic-medium educational background participated in the study. Within this sample group, students were drawn from four university colleges: College of Engineering, College of Business, College of Law, and College of Shari’a and Islamic Studies. \nThe study’s findings unveil a complex, often mixed and divided picture of students’ perceptions about the socialising roles of both English-medium and Arabic-medium education. In regard to English-medium education, it finds that though there is a general acceptance of the benefits of studying the English-language, there is also to some extent an acknowledgement of the culturally alienating effects on Arab-Muslim students. \nThe study therefore recommends that granted the paucity of research in this area there is a need to further investigate students’ perceptions from a broader range of institutional cultures in the region.","bibo:AuthorList":["Karmani, Sohail","Rich, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2010-02-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

An innovative chefs’ apprenticeship in a dedicated restaurant provides a setting in which to explore what happens when a group of young people are learning to become fully accepted members of a community of practice.  The setting, the social enterprise of Fifteen London, is founded on a passionate belief in the learning potential of all individuals, regardless of background.  Conducted over a period of five years this ethnographic study tells the stories of the apprentices; the story of the community; and the story of conducting the investigation.  A pilot study completed in 2005 revealed that beyond the mediation observed between individuals, apprentices’ felt their experience of the culture of the learning environment had a greater impact.\n\nThe thesis explores the theoretical implications of these findings.  Drawn from a sociocultural perspective, two theoretical frameworks are applied: Mediated Learning Experience (Feuerstein, Miller and Tannenbaum, 1994) concerned with the mediation between people and its effect on human development; and Situated Learning (Lave and Wenger, 1991) concerned with participation in a community of practice.  These frameworks were felt to be useful to an analysis which demonstrates that a community of practice can be analysed according to the framework for Mediated Learning Experience.  The symbiosis of these two approaches creates a coherent framework for discourse in which to analyse the learning process itself.  A description of the community highlights the complexities of learning, and the challenges of attempting to change the course of human development by means of cultural transmission and social enterprise.  I conclude that this learning environment serves as a good example of what can be achieved when innovation works hand in hand with moral purpose.","bibo:AuthorList":["Silver, Judy","Burden, Robert"],"dc:date":"2009-08-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Chapter 2 investigates the transmission from UK policy and a range of wholesale money market rates to retail mortgage rates using a single-equation error correction model (SEECM) framework, from 1995 to 2009. The results add to previous studies by showing that the UK retail banking sector is imperfectly competitive at the aggregate level. More specifically, discounted rates, and to a lesser extent fixed rates behave competitively, whilst standard variable rates do not, which can be interpreted as evidence of exploitation of inert borrower behaviour. A snap-shot of the relative levels of variable rate lending across EU-15 countries is taken in the next Chapter 3, illustrating general cross-country differences. Risk simulations show that economies more conducive to variable rate mortgages include those with relatively volatile, persistent, and low inflation; low and stable real interest rates; high real income growth; and low correlation between inflation and real interest rate shocks. Regressions show that macroeconomic histories may indeed be important determinants of variable rate mortgage prevalence. The final Chapter 4 integrates a quantity optimising banking sector that lends under either a fixed or variable rate, into a model with borrowing constrained households. This provides a framework that can be used to investigate relationships between the structure of debt contracts and monetary policy. In particular, the propagation of a productivity shock in the non-durable sector under Ramsey monetary policy is presented, and it is demonstrated that the introduction of overlapping debt contracts tempers the effect of the financial multiplier. An appropriate design of the composition of fixed versus variable rate debt contracts, both their length and interest rate composition, could therefore reduce the volatility of key economic variables, and so there are important policy implications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rogers, Jack","Kirsanova, Tatiana"],"dc:date":"2009-11-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This thesis also aims to study Zarruq’s concept of juridical Sufism as manifested in this book. Qawaid is one of the most significant works of Zarruq in which he tried to introduce the principles of Sufism in a way that integrates shariah with haqiqah and incorporates theology and jurisprudence with the tariqah; or a fusion of legal rectitude within Sufi devotion and piety. Interpreting the Shadhili notion of usuli tasawwuf, Zarruq constructed the theory of juridical Sufism on its theological and metaphysical grounds. The presentation of Islam in such an integrated form appealed and attracted not only the Muslim scholars but also saints to his most impressive accomplishment. His teachings and intellectual legacy left a lasting impact on Maghribi society, in particular the circles of the Shadhiliyah which were renamed the Zarruqiyah due to his impact. \n\nThis thesis is divided into two parts. The first part consists of the edited text of Qawaid al-Tasawwuf since the main concern of this thesis is to restore the original text and verify the authenticity of its contents by the comparative study of its MSS. In order to establish a clear, authentic and authoritative text, the rules of codicology, orthography and methods of textual research have been applied. Six MSS and a published edition have been used for the restoration of the text. After establishing the text, some appendices have been added to make the text more accessible for readers. These appendices contain some additional Qawaid, references to Quranic verses, Prophetic traditions, and sources mentioned in the text. Moreover a bibliography and index is fixed at the end.\n\nThe second part contains an introduction which has been divided into six unequal sections. The first section is a short introduction to Zarruq’s life, his teachers, his travels from Morocco to the Hijaz as well as his migration to Misratah and other important events of his life. The second section is an attempt to present Zarruq’s intellectual heritage by outlining his works and the contribution of his Sufi order. The third section is an introduction to the manuscripts and published editions of Qawaid al-Tasawwuf. The fourth section explains the methodology of editing used for the restoration of the text. The fifth section is a description and analysis of Qawaid al-Tasawwuf. The most significant task of this section is to analyze Zarruq’s ideas as manifested in this book in order to appreciate how he amalgamates and integrates Islamic jurisprudence with Sufism. We consider this his most significant contribution to the Sufi heritage because of its distinctive genre, theme and its innovative ideas concerning the unification of the Sufi path with law and theology and its elaboration and explanation though the qawaid genre, upon the model of works of al-qawaid al-fiqhiyah wa-al-usuliyah (jurisprudential and theological maxims). The sixth section is a summary of Qawaid al-Tasawwuf. According to the Escorial MS the Qawaid consists of a preface, an epilogue and two hundred and twenty four principles.

Although some recent observations suggest substellar atmospheric and evolutionary models may be inconsistent with observations, there have been few conclusive tests to date.  I will present high angular resolution optical, near-infrared, and thermal-infrared imaging and medium-resolution (up to R~5000) spectroscopy of these two T dwarfs. Using these data I have derived luminosities of log L/Lsun \u003d -4.699 +/- 0.017 and -5.232 +/- 0.020 for Epsilon Indi Ba, Bb, respectively, and I will show that the predictions of substellar evolutionary models using luminosity and mass constraints are inconsistent with the effective temperatures and surface gravities derived from fitting atmospheric models to observed spectra. Furthermore, I will show that, even where estimates of the effective temperature, surface gravity, and luminosity are available, estimates of the mass of cool brown dwarfs can be up to a factor of two lower than the measured dynamical mass.  Considering the difficulty in assigning accurate ages to any system and the mass-luminosity-age degeneracy of brown dwarfs, I would caution against the over-analysis of predicted brown dwarf masses at this time.\n\nI have also used Chandra X-ray observations to identify near-complete and relatively unbiased samples of pre-main-sequence stars in the young stellar clusters NGC 2244 and Trumpler 14. Using optical photometric and spectroscopic observations, I will characterise the apparent age spreads seen in the cluster pre-main-sequences. Mass estimates will then be derived for their stellar populations and used to construct the initial mass function for each cluster. It is found that NGC 2244 appears to have a Salpeter-like IMF for stars in the mass range 0.5--2.0 Msun if a likely age of 2 Myr is adopted, while Tr 14 may have a top-heavy IMF at a similar age. However, I will show that because the observed slopes of the cluster pre-main-sequences are not well-matched by the predicted slope in colour-magnitude space, such determinations are heavily dependent on the assumed age of the cluster and complicated due to the large spreads in isochronal ages.","bibo:AuthorList":["King, Robert R.","McCaughrean, Mark J."],"dc:date":"2009-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Chapter two gives an overview of some contemporary theories of addiction and the possible processes underlying addiction. The second part provides details of chronic (intervention) and acute studies that have assessed the effects of exercise on cigarette cravings, smoking withdrawal symptoms and cue-reactivity. The findings will be discussed in terms of the type and duration of exercise utilised and the strength and duration of effects on subjective desire to smoke and cigarette cravings. Lastly, some possible mechanisms by which exercise may exert effect on cravings and cue-reactivity are identified.  This background provides a basis for the subsequent studies. \n\nChapter three describes an experimental study (Study 1), in which fMRI was used to compare brain activation response to smoking-related stimuli (compared with neutral stimuli) during nicotine abstinence and immediately following smoking a cigarette. The aim of this study was to pilot methods for future fMRI studies to assess the effects of a single session of exercise on brain responses to smoking-related images. Previous evidence has shown that during periods of deprivation, stimuli of perceived ‘salient’ importance (i.e. smoking-related images, such as images of people smoking) are associated with enhanced activation in areas of the brain known as the mesocortical-limbic circuit (i.e. nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate) (Due et al, 2002; David et al 2005; McClernon et al, 2005; Smolka et al 2006). \n\nChapter four and five describe two further fMRI studies (Study 2 and 3). These two studies sought to investigate the effects of an acute bout of exercise on regional brain activation to smoking-related (compared to neutral) images. The first study (Chapter 4) uses an event-related design whereby smoking and neutral images were randomly presented during scanning. The second study (Chapter 5) employs a block design method, whereby individuals view a randomised block of either 3 smoking or 3 neutral images. \n\nChapter six describes a study (Study 4) designed to examine the effects of an acute bout of exercise on attentional bias to smoking-related images. This study utilised an eye tracking methodology to compare duration of gaze and direction of fixation following a session of passive rest or acute exercise. Previous studies in this area (without the exercise session comparison) have demonstrated that’s smokers show enhanced gaze duration toward smoking stimuli (versus control cues or non smokers) (i.e. Mogg et al, 2005) and during nicotine deprivation (i.e. Field et al, 2004). Some studies have suggested these biases in attention may be associated with higher subjective cravings (i.e. Mogg et al, 2005; Field et al, 2009). All studies assessed the effects of exercise on subjective cravings to smoke. \n\nAn overall summary of findings and discussion is presented in Chapter 8. The findings are conceptualised and integrated into existing theories of addiction, and ideas for future research are presented. \n\nThe work presented in this thesis has been presented at both National and International conferences and is either published or is under review in peer review journals.

Since the early 1990s it has increasingly concerned itself\nwith psycho-social issues (e.g. trauma treatment or reconciliation) in the aftermath of\nviolent protracted social conflicts. Within this psycho-social space there has been a\ngrowing interest in the use of music in conflict transformation to improve relationships\nbetween in and out-groups. However, the field of music and conflict transformation is\nstill nascent, with little in-depth research available. The majority of studies have been\nundertaken by interested parties or relies on anecdotal evidence from organisers and\nmusicians with little concern for the context of the music use. Participants, whose\nattitudes and relationships to out-groups are the focus of conflict transformation\ninterventions, are largely overlooked and their views are rarely discussed. Furthermore,\nthere are few detailed studies on exactly how music affects conflict transformation\noutcomes. Instead allusions are often made to terms such as “the power of music” which\nact as a black box intended to explain how music “works”, but patently fail to do so. \n\nThis thesis attempts to fill these two gaps in the literature by focusing on the\nparticipants’ experiences in two different conflict transformation contexts, a multi-\ncultural music project for school children in Noway and the casual music use in a\nsettlement of internally displaced persons in Sudan. Through qualitative research\nmethods, rich descriptive data from different parties is gathered. The data is analysed\nusing grounded theory. As a result a very different and more complex picture emerges\nthat enriches the current understanding of how music is used and perceived in conflict\ntransformation contexts. In particular, how participants view these activities and how\npower relationships, though rarely mentioned, affect the music use is explored in detail.\nSome tentative suggestions indicate that music works best when used in longitudinal\nbottom-up activities and that music can augment conflict transformation activities rather\nthan replace them. Additionally, it is proposed that music may work as a form of benign\ninterruption in conflict transformation activities and that musical events provide a\nliminal space where the real work lies in the process of bringing any changes in\nattitudes from the liminal space into everyday life.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bergh, Arild","DeNora, Tia"],"dc:date":"2010-02-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In the first study, six male participants (21.7 [S.D. 2.2] yrs, 74.0 [S.D. 6.9] kg [March], 74.6 [S.D. 6.9] kg (May), footwear size 10 -11) performed running and turning movements on natural and third generation artificial surfaces whilst wearing different soccer specific footwear. This was performed at two times of the year where contrasting weather conditions were experienced. It was observed that there were significant differences when the natural and third generation artificial turf surfaces were compared. These differences however, were dependent on the type of movement, time of year and biomechanical measurement used. Each surface was also compared between the two test occasions. The main finding was that for both running and turning peak pressures and peak pressure loading rates were significantly greater in May (when the surfaces were mechanically hard) compared with the same surface in March. It was concluded that comparisons of third generation surfaces with natural turf are dependent on the specific properties of the surfaces and cannot be generalized for all such surfaces.\n\nA critical design feature of third generation surfaces that will influence biomechanical comparisons with other playing surfaces is the shock pad layer.  In the second experimental chapter, ten male participants (20.9 yrs [S.D. 2.5], 83.2 kg [S.D. 7.1], footwear size 10 -11) were used to assess the effect of two different shock pad densities (55g and 65g) (Arpro® Expanded polypropylene BF2455W, 24mm S.D. 0.5mm thick, Brock International) on the lower extremity loading. These participants were also used to assess the biomechanical adaptations that occur with the inclusion of a 10 mm Sorbothane® heel insert or a Sorbothane® cushioning insole (Sorbo products division, Lancashire, UK), which have been associated with reducing overuse injury including that to the Achilles tendon. The footwear was also assessed for the risk of sustaining lateral ankle ligament damage. It was shown that whilst turning, peak impact force (taken using in-shoe pressure system) was significantly lower on the more cushioned shock pad as was peak pressure at the first metatarsal. Likewise, the time to peak impact force was significantly longer with the heel insert. However, despite the association between the heel insert and reduced dorsi-flexion, no significant differences were observed for this measurement between the footwear conditions. Peak plantar flexion was significantly greater with the heel insert whilst turning suggesting an increased loading of the lateral ankle ligaments, although rearfoot inversion was not significantly different.  This study demonstrated the potential role of shock pad cushioning in providing protection from impact related injury in soccer, whilst cushioning inserts were not found to provide a protective effect.  For heel inserts, the possibility of a negative influence on rearfoot stability was highlighted.  It was suggested that the estimation of internal loads may reveal more regarding the specific role of cushioning interfaces and heel inserts in protecting from injury. \n\nIn the final research chapter, nine male soccer players (83.4 kg [S.D. 5.8], 23 yrs [S.D. 3.7]) performed running and turning movements for the same conditions described in study two.  The peak plantar flexion moment, Achilles tendon force and average loading rate of these measurements, were used to assess Achilles tendon loading. Likewise, peak dorsi-flexion and eversion moments were collected to assess the lateral ankle loading. Group analysis did not reveal any significant differences in these variables. Individual data showed that the response to heel insert intervention was specific to the participant. Some participants exhibited a reduced Achilles tendon force or average loading rate, suggesting a reduced risk of injury with the heel insert. However, it was observed that eversion and dorsi-flexion moment and average loading rates increased in some participants, suggesting that these participants were at an increased risk of lateral ankle ligament injury with the heel insert. Likewise, one participant experienced significantly greater peak Achilles tendon force, also indicating a greater risk of injury to this structure.\n\nThe overall conclusions gained from these studies are that the design of the footwear and playing surfaces are worth considering in the quest to reduce injury risk. It was also highlighted that the choice of shock pad density for a third generation artificial surface can be influential in the protection of the athlete even when the surface is new, particularly when turning. Finally, although the use of heel inserts has proven successful in the reduction the Achilles tendon injury, the lack of significant differences for group comparisons suggests that the mechanisms behind the success is still unclear. However, although heel inserts may prove useful in the reduction of Achilles tendon injury, the observation that significant increases in the measurements associated with acute ankle ligament damage and chronic Achilles tendon injury, suggests that heel lift may not be suitable for some individuals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Low, Daniel Craig","Dixon, Sharon J"],"dc:date":"2010-01-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":2735925,"ep:Repository":45,"dc:type":["Thesis or dissertation","Doctoral","PhD","PhD in Biological Sciences"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Impacts of the human pharmaceutical diclofenac in the aquatic environment","bibo:abstract":"An increasing number of pharmaceuticals have been found in the aquatic environment and the issue has become a human and environmental health concern. Many pharmaceuticals are not fully degraded in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and are continuously released in the aquatic environment resulting in concentrations in the low µg/l range in the receiving waters. Diclofenac is a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and is persistent in the aquatic environment. This pharmaceutical has been frequently reported in wastewater effluents, surface waters, groundwaters and even drinking water. NSAIDs are known to inhibit the cyclooxygenase activity, an enzyme present in many species of the animal kingdom responsible for the synthesis of prostanoids, and chronic exposure to environmental diclofenac may have detrimental effects on metabolism of non-target organisms including microbes and fish. In this thesis, microbiology, genomics and metabolomics approaches were used to investigate the effects of diclofenac on aquatic microbes and fish.\nIn the first study of the thesis (chapter 3), the biodegradation of selected NSAIDs was investigated, together with their potential toxicity to aquatic microbes. Aerobic biodegradation experiments were conducted using activated sludge and wastewater effluents as microbial inocula and diclofenac, ketoprofen or naproxen as sole carbon source (1-10 mg/l) in order to isolate and identify the bacterial degraders. Changes in the bacterial populations were monitored by optical density and PCR-DGGE. The analytical techniques solid phase extraction (SPE) and ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS) were optimised to quantify the pharmaceuticals in environmental samples. High recovery rates were obtained with 94% for diclofenac; 92% for ketoprofen and 85% for naproxen and with detection capabilities down to 3-7 ng/l. Results from the biodegradation experiments showed that ketoprofen and naproxen were eliminated at up to 99 and 55% respectively over a 40 days period. Consistently with previous studies, diclofenac showed no significant degradation. In all the enrichments, a significant decrease in the bacterial abundance was observed as a consequence of NSAIDs exposure and attempts to isolate the bacterial degrading populations were unsuccessful. Given the apparent micro-toxicity of these NSAIDs, the standardised test Microtox@ was carried out with Vibrio fischeri. The EC50 (15 min) estimated ranged from 13.5 mg/l + 2.3 for diclofenac to 42.1 mg/l + 3.9 for naproxen. Further toxicological tests were performed with diclofenac on bacterial strains isolated from activated sludge. Growth inhibitory effects were observed from 50-70 mg/l for Micrococcus luteus, Zoogloea ramigera and Comamonas denitrificans. Pseudomonas putida seemed more tolerant to diclofenac exposure and toxic effects were observed from 90 mg/l. These studies showed that diclofenac was the most toxic NSAID but toxicological effects in bacteria only occurred at concentrations at least 1,000 times higher than those found in the environment. However, chronic exposure to lower concentrations may cause similar interferences and affect the degradation potential of naturally occurring microbial populations.\nThe second study (chapter 4) investigated the biological effects of sub-chronic exposure to waterborne diclofenac (0.5, 1, 5 and 25 µg/l) in female juvenile rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. After 21-day exposure, mRNA expression levels of cytochrome p450 1a1 (cyp1a1), cyclooxygenase (cox) 1 and 2, and p53 were investigated in the liver, kidney and gills using RT-PCR and QPCR. These genes were selected as they are likely targets for diclofenac in mammals. Histopathological investigations were carried out in the small intestine, liver and kidney because diclofenac has been reported to induce toxicity responses in these tissues. Fish bile was also analysed by SPE and UPLC-TOF-MS to evaluate the bioconcentration potential of diclofenac and look for evidences of diclofenac metabolism. Results showed a significant reduction of both cox1 and cox2 expression in the liver, gills and kidney from 1 μg diclofenac/l. In contrast diclofenac induced an increase in mRNA levels for cyp1a1 in the liver and gills but a significant reduction of cyp1a1 expression in the kidney from 1 µg/l. There were no clear effects of diclofenac on the mRNA levels of p53. Diclofenac exposure caused tissue damages at exposure concentrations as low as 1 µg/l. Histopathological injuries included inflammation, hyperplasia and fusion of the villi in the small intestine and tubule necrosis in the kidney. There were no obvious changes in the liver of diclofenac-exposed fish. The analysis of bile revealed a bioconcentration potential between 509 + 27 and 657 + 25. A reactive metabolite of diclofenac was also detected at the highest exposure concentration which may be responsible for the severe injuries found in those fish. Sub-chronic exposure to environmental concentrations of diclofenac altered gene expression and it is possible that long term exposure to environmental diclofenac lead to significant impacts on fish health.\nIn the final part of this thesis (chapters 5 and 6) effects on the metabolite composition of biofluids were analysed in diclofenac-exposed fish. This work entailed developing and validating appropriate methodologies to analyse fish bile and blood plasma. Methanol extraction and UPLC-TOF-MS were optimised to analyse the plasma metabolome but the methodologies were not suitable to detect low abundance molecules such as eicosanoids due to the interferences (ion suppression) in the samples matrix. Multivariate data analysis failed to detect the endogenous metabolites of the plasma affected by the chemical exposure. The only discriminating metabolite was found after analysis of the plasma samples from control vs. 25 µg/l treatment groups and identified as the exogenous compound diclofenac. To analyse the bile, the developed SPE methodology was carried out in order to separate the metabolites between a free steroids (fatty acids, eicosanoids, etc.) fraction and a conjugated steroids (bile salts) fraction. Due to high levels of taurocholic acid masking other metabolites in the conjugated fraction, some bile samples were hydrolysed to deconjugate these metabolites. The non-hydrolysed and hydrolysed bile fractions were analysed by UPLC-TOF-MS in positive and negative ionization. Multivariate data analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed significant perturbations in the bile metabolite profile of diclofenac-exposed rainbow from the lowest exposure concentration (0.5 µg/l). Over 50 metabolites were elevated or reduced as a result of the 21-day exposure, suggesting that diclofenac affected several metabolic pathways. One metabolite was identified as a lipooxygenase product. This suggests that the inhibition of prostanoids synthesis can cause a shift in the arachidonic cascade and increase the synthesis of other eicosanoids. Most of the other discriminative metabolites remain unidentified and FT-MS analysis will be performed to obtain a structural identity. The metabolomics study further highlights the concern of environmental diclofenac in non-target organisms and the need to investigate the metabolic pathways affected.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mehinto, Alvine Coralie","Tyler, Charles R."],"dc:date":"2009-10-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23548,"sim:weight":0.186248,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.163847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26781,"sim:weight":0.142419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26784,"sim:weight":0.121182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Neither view is satisfactory and both are based on reductions and generalisations that are perhaps inevitable when so complex a subject is reduced to a handful of paragraphs in broader Iraq-focussed works.   \n\nThe first step to understanding sectarian identity in Iraq is to treat it is a group identity rather than a religious or political identity. Secondly, to avoid generalisations and reductions, it is necessary to identify the drivers of sectarian relations and sectarian identity and to understand the social factors that animate sectarian identity (here considerations of class and geography are essential). Thirdly, the relationship between sectarian identity and national identity has been sorely misunderstood and commentators have tended to treat the two as mutually antagonistic forms of identity. Finally and perhaps most importantly, is the question of salience: there is no such thing as a fixed and perpetually salient identity. \n\nThe theoretical arguments outlined in chapters 2 and 3 will be used in the remainder of the study to focus on two major turning points in Iraqi sectarian relations: the uprising in southern Iraq of March 1991 (and more importantly the contentious memory of the uprisings) and the fall of the Ba’ath in 2003. Chapters 4-6 deal with the events of 1991, the subsequent sanctions-era and the competing mythologies of the uprisings while chapters 7 and 8 examine the post-2003 era, the politicisation of sectarian identities and, perhaps consequently, the sectarian civil war of 2006-2007. With regards to sectarian relations, I would argue that no other episode in modern Iraqi history have had as polarised a memory as these two events.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haddad, Fanar","Stansfield, Gareth"],"dc:date":"2010-03-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This research aimed to establish whether metabolic and reproductive performance costs were associated with the resistance phenomenon and what the biochemical mechanisms of resistance were, by comparing animals from the Creek with two comparable study sites in the South West of England: Froe Creek and the Teign estuary.  There was a significant metabolic cost, measured as a reduction  in Scope for Growth, associated with the resistance phenomenon.  As no differences in energy intake or uptake were found between resistant and non-resistant animals it was concluded that this cost was covered by demand-side regulation of energetics.  A reduction in the amount of biochemical energy reserves in the form of lipids and sugars was also observed in resistant animals suggesting that resource allocation had been shifted away from this endpoint and towards maintenance and activity.  \n\nThe perturbed metabolism and physiology of resistant N. diversicolor is shown to have detrimental consequences for their life-history.  Sexually mature, resistant females were significantly smaller than non-resistant ones, indicating that they had either matured at a younger age or grown more slowly.  Both total fecundity and mass-specific fecundity were significantly reduced in resistant females, likely as a direct result of the metabolic costs of resistance reducing the resources available to fuel gametogenesis.  No differences were found in the energetic reserves stocked within each gamete by resistant and non-resistant animals, suggesting that this trait is heavily selected for. \n\nSynthesis of reduced glutathione [GSH] in resistant animals’ tissues appeared to be elevated.  Glutathione peroxidase activity was also increased, likely to remediate the effects of Reactive Chemical Species [RCS] that result from the inevitably incomplete binding of intracellular metals.  As GSH functions in metal detoxification to covalently binding metals entering resistant animals’ cells, preventing their involvement in toxic interactions and their catalysis of the production of RCS, it is proposed that together there two phenomena comprise the fundamental mechanism of resistance to metal toxicity.  \n \nUltimately, this research revealed a hierarchy of health and reproductive performance across the three study populations, with significant associations evident between measured biological endpoints and the degree of metal contamination, illustrating the consequences of anthropogenic pollution for the biology of wild animals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pook, Christopher James","Galloway, Tamara","Lewis, Ceri"],"dc:date":"2009-09-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Why is Cornish wrestling ‘different’? Why has Cornish wrestling survived? It was argued that in order to provide an adequate historical analysis it was necessary to locate the sport within an appropriate and relevant conceptual framework. Two fields of enquiry were identified as having the potential to provide this; mainstream British sport history and the ‘new Cornish Studies’. The main ideas and debates that form the basis for these two areas were reviewed and it was argued that British sport history offered only a partial interpretation for the history of Cornish wrestling as the evidence suggests it is different from other sports. It was further argued that with its emphasis upon ‘difference’ the ‘new Cornish Studies’ in general and Payton’s ‘centre-periphery model’ in particular offers a more appropriate conceptual framework, which is also rooted in a relevant local context. Payton developed his model to answer a number of questions relating to Cornwall’s distinctiveness: Why is Cornwall ‘different’? Why has this persisted? Why is there a strong sense of ‘Cornishness’ and separate identity which has survived until today? He concluded that Cornwall’s ‘difference’ has persisted because of its historical experience, which in each period has been distinct from other areas of Britain and has led directly to a unique identity. In Payton’s model, the privileged ‘centre’, which is the location of power and influence, is based largely in London and the south-east of England; whereas the ‘periphery’ is geographically remote from the ‘centre’, but dependent upon it. Payton proposed three phases of peripherality: ‘First’ or ‘Older Peripheralism’, characterised by geographical and cultural isolation from the centre; ‘Second Peripheralism’, which recognises the central importance of industrial change, producing economic and social marginality and ‘Third Peripheralism’ characterised by a ‘branch-factory’ economy promoting a process of ‘counter-urbanisation’. The structure of the thesis follows the phases of peripherality and argues the evidence is consistent with Payton’s ‘centre-periphery model’. The evidence also demonstrates that Cornish wrestling is ‘different’ and that ‘difference’ has persisted over time because of Cornwall’s historical experience, which in each period of peripherality has been distinct. Furthermore, throughout the entire period of the study, Cornish wrestling has been, and still remains, an important icon of Cornishness, which has ensured its survival.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tripp, Michael","Payton, Philip"],"dc:date":"2010-05-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Following an initial review, wireless technology was identified as\nhaving many desirable attributes as a modern underground data transmission medium. Wireless\nsystems are mobile, flexible, and easily scalable. Installation time can be reduced and there is\nscope for rapid deployment of wireless sensor networks following an emergency incident such\nas a mine explosion or roof rock fall. Low power mesh technology, relating to the Zigbee and\nIEEE 802.15.4 LR-WPAN (low-rate wireless personal area network) standards, has been of\nparticular interest within this research project. The new breed of LR-WPAN technology is\nspecifically designed for low power, low data rate wireless sensor applications. The mesh\nnetworking characteristics of the technology significantly increase network robustness and\nresilience. The self-healing, self-organising, multiple pathway redundancy, and highly scalable\nattributes of mesh networks are particularly advantageous for underground, or confined space,\nhigh-integrity safety and emergency applications. The study and potential use of this type of\ntechnology in an underground mine is a novel aspect of this thesis.\nThe initial feasibility and review examined the current and future trends of modern underground\ndata transmission systems, with particular focus on mine safety. The findings following the\nreview determined the ideal requirements of an underground data transmission in terms of\nrobustness, integrity, interoperability, survivability and flexibility; with wireless mesh\nnetworking meeting many of these requirements.\nThis research has investigated underground wireless propagation characteristics at UHF and\nmicrowave frequencies in tunnels. This has involved examining electromagnetic (EM)\nwaveguide theory, in particular the lossy dielectric tunnel waveguide model e.g. (Emslie et al.,\n1975 and Delogne, 1982). Extensive tests have been carried out in three different underground\nlocations (railway tunnel, hard rock mine, coal mine test facility) using continuous wave (CW),\nor ‘pure’ transmission at 2.3GHz and 5.8GHz, along with a range of throughput performance\ntests using various wireless technologies: IEEE 802.11b, 802.11g, SuperG, SuperG (plus\nBeamFlex antennas), 802.11pre-n. 802.11draft-n, and Bluetooth. The results of these practical\ntests have been compared with the lossy dielectric tunnel waveguide model showing good\nagreement that tunnels will in fact enhance the EM propagation through the waveguide effect.\nBuilding on previous research during the last 30 years into high frequency underground radio\ntransmission, this work presents a novel investigation into the performance of modern\nunderground wireless technologies operating in underground mines and tunnels.\n4\nThe feasibility and performance of low power wireless mesh networking technology, relating to\nZigbee/IEEE 802.15.4, operating in various underground and confined space environments has\nbeen investigated through a series of practical tests in different locations including: a hard rock\ntest mine, a coal mine and a fire training centre (confined space built infrastructure). The results\nof these tests are presented discussing the significant benefits in employing ‘mesh’ topologies in\nmines and tunnels. Following this, key applications were identified for potential development.\nDistributed smart sensor network e.g. environmental monitoring, machine diagnostics or remote\ntelemetry, applications were developed to a proof-of-concept stage. A remote 3D surveying\ntelemetry application was also developed in conjunction with the ‘RSV’ (remote surveying\nvehicle) project at CSM. Vital signs monitoring of personnel has also been examined, with tests\ncarried out in conjunction with the London Fire Service. ‘Zonal location information’ was\nanother key application identified using underground mesh wireless networks to provide active\ntracking of personnel and vehicles as a lower cost alternative to RFID. Careful consideration has\nalso been given to potential future work, ranging from ‘mine friendly’ antennas, to a ‘hybrid\nZigbee’, such as, optimised routing algorithms, and improved physical RF performance,\nspecifically for high-integrity underground safety and emergency applications. Both the tests\ncarried out and key safety applications investigated have been a novel contribution of this thesis.\nIn summary, this thesis has contributed to furthering the knowledge within the field of\nsubsurface electromagnetic wave propagation at UHF and microwave frequencies. Key\ncharacteristics and requirements of an underground critical safety data transmission system have\nbeen identified. Novel aspects of this work involved investigating the application of new\nwireless mesh technology for underground environments, and investigating the performance of\nmodern wireless technologies in tunnels through practical tests and theoretical analysis. Finally,\nthis thesis has proved that robust and survivable underground data transmission, along with\nassociated mine safety applications, can feasibly be achieved using the low power wireless mesh\nnetworking technology. Robust underground wireless networking also has potential benefits for\nother industrial and public sectors including tunnelling, emergency services and transport.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kennedy, Gareth Allan","Foster, Patrick"],"dc:date":"2006-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In the preliminary study, two performance-based defence equipment provision contracts were investigated in an attempt to understand the role of interpersonal relationships between individual service providers and customers in a maintenance, repair and overhaul environment where firms need to deliver outcomes jointly with the customer. Through two years of field work using in-depth interviews, the study uncovered two types of interpersonal relationships between service providers and customers; exchange and communal. Both strongly promoted cooperation at the individual level. In exchange relationships, service providers and customers cooperated reciprocally whilst in communal relationships, they shared a common group identity and cooperated communally towards the attainment of group goals. Specifically, individuals’ perceived reciprocity from the customer and communal orientation have been identified as drivers for relationship development.\nThe relationship drivers were discovered through qualitative data and were matched with extant academic literature, after which several hypotheses and a measurement instrument were developed. The hypotheses and instrument were then validated through a quantitative study using exploratory factor analysis and regression analysis. Data was collected from a sample consisting of 224 Chinese salespeople dealing with business customers in manufacturing as well as service industries.  The findings were used to develop a theoretical framework which showed that cognition (e.g. perceived consequences), affect (e.g. liking) and specific personality traits (e.g. communal orientation) were drivers for relational behaviours. In particular, communal orientation, perceived reciprocity from the customer, and a liking for the customer positively affected relational behaviours, while exchange orientation had a negative impact on those behaviours. This research provides a generic theoretical model of firm’s employees’ relational behaviours in the service provision and marketing context, filling in the gaps found in previous relationship marketing research by studying relationship drivers for individual-level customer relationships.","bibo:AuthorList":["Guo, Lei","Ng, Irene C.

In Study 1, the extent to which teacher attitudes towards inclusion were affected by two variables—teacher-related variables and educational environment-related variables—were examined. Teachers of Reception and Key Stage 1 classes in Brunei, and in a county in the south-west of England were asked to respond to a questionnaire concerning their willingness to include HSN students in their class. The questionnaire was designed as a means of obtaining information concerning the teachers’ background variables, teachers’ attitudes towards inclusion and the availability of support structures and services received by the teachers. The data were analysed using a series of statistical methods which included analysis of variance (ANOVA), t-test and Pearson correlation. The major finding was that both the Brunei and UK teachers held positive attitudes towards inclusion of HSN students, with the teachers in the UK being more positive than teachers in Brunei. Factors associated with more positive attitudes are discussed with reference to background variables, support structures and service deliveries, as well as cultural and policy differences between these two countries. \n\nFollowing this study, Study 2 was carried out in which the provision of support services, including the role of EPs in the inclusion of HSN students in mainstream schools in Brunei and the UK, was further explored. In this descriptive study, the support structures in Brunei were compared to those in the UK, with specific regard to the roles of EPs towards the inclusion of HSN students.  This study examined the perspectives of teachers and EPs in Brunei and the UK regarding the provision, support structures and service delivery currently operating in the class and/or school. A specially designed questionnaire was administered to the teachers, and a sample of teachers and EPs were interviewed. While quantitative data was analysed using the SPSS package, qualitative data including interview transcripts were analysed using identification, coding and comparing common themes. Results showed that teachers in Brunei and the UK indicate the issues of resources and teaching materials, support from SENCOs, TAs and EPs and more aide time, as support structures currently operating in the class or school for successful inclusion to take place. While Brunei teachers rate the involvement of EPs towards the inclusion of HSN students as very important, teachers in the UK rate EPs’ involvement as important. With regard to the role of EPs, teachers in Brunei gave important ratings to all the ten Educational Psychology services listed. Teachers in the UK gave important ratings to eight of the services while their role in conducting research and constructing IEPs were considered as neither important nor unimportant.  \n\nOn the other hand, EPs in Brunei and the UK perceived their roles in consultation as important. Teachers in both countries wanted EPs to be available on a daily basis at their schools.  Implications for future Educational Psychology practice and research are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Maidin, Hajah Mustazah","Richards, Andrew","Maxwell, Tim"],"dc:date":"2009-11-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

An assumption that the channel has a sufficiently large radius in comparison with its gap-width\nis employed, so that the curvature effect can be neglected. The aspect ratio of the channel has great influence on\nthe convective flow in it. Guided by the result of the linear stability analysis, we perform\nthree-dimensional numerical simulations to investigate the convective flows under three different types of\naspect ratios, which are namely the moderate or large aspect ratios, the very small\naspect ratios and the moderately small aspect ratios. Also, we numerically study how convection in the channel is affected by inhomogeneous heat fluxes on sidewalls, which is a simple simulation of the thermal interaction between the Earth\u0027s core and mantle.\n\n\nConvection and dynamo action in a rapidly rotating, self-gravitating, Boussinesq fluid sphere is the other concern.\nWe develop a finite element model for the dynamo problem in a whole sphere. This model is constructed by incorporating dynamo equations with globally implemented magnetic boundary conditions to a\nwhole sphere convection model, which is also presented here. The coordinate singularity at the center usually encountered when applying the spectral method is no longer an obstacle and no nonphysical assumptions (i.e. hyper-diffusivities) are used in our model. A large effort has been made to efficiently parallelize the model. Consequently, it can take the full advantage of modern massively parallel computers. Based on this dynamo model, we investigate the dynamo process in a sphere and find that self-sustaining dynamos are more difficult to obtain in a sphere than in a spherical shell. They are activated at relatively high Rayleigh numbers. Moreover, the magnetic fields generated are not dipole-dominant, different from those generated in most dynamo simulations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhan, Xiaoya","Zhang, Keke"],"dc:date":"2010-03-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Fourteen disabled young people from one specialist and three secondary mainstream settings were interviewed using semi-structured interviews to gain their views on friendship and belonging in schools. Three groups of parents, TAs, SENCos and allied education professionals engaged in action research to examine these views, their own views and values and those of disabled young people in their families and schools in order to better understand the sensitivities and subtleties of successful social inclusion and to consider change to whole school practice. The limitations that non-disabled adults unwittingly ‘construct’ that act as barriers to friendship and social inclusion were explicitly recognised in this interpretive research as a contribution to informing practice and theory in this domain. \nPaper One focuses on the views of young people and the meaning and importance they placed on friendship and social relationships in their lives. Findings included that young people in specialist and mainstream setting highly valued friendships but that sustaining friendships in the wider community was often problematic for those participants who attended schools outside their local community. This mainly affected the specialist setting students but was also recognised as an issue by some of the mainstream parents who lived outside the catchment area. Findings also revealed that young people gained their sense of belonging from the positive relationships they formed with TAs and teachers as well as friends. In order for friendship and positive social inclusion to develop, however, participants required schools to provide a supportive environment of accessible rooms, doors and lifts and adults who trusted them to have the competency and agency to manage their social times and spaces with choice and autonomy.  The issue of ‘surplus visibility’ was highlighted by disabled young people who spoke of an experience of school where lack of choice concerning where and with whom to spend  break times limited their friendship opportunities and sense of well-being and inclusion. This was compounded by an expectation of compliance by adults and automatic assumption of their belonging to a disabled group despite differences of sex, gender or common interests. The participants valued genuine connection through humour, interests and social support and were active in seeking private time for talking with friends. Schools that provided a range of highly social or quieter, more private, locations for students were highly valued. Paper Two describes using these views as stimulus for action research to bring about change towards improved social inclusion. Groups of parents, senior management, SENCos, TAs and other education professionals met formally three times over a four month period. These groups examined vignettes selected from data from paper one, engaged in debate and discussions, interviewed disabled young people themselves, formulated key concept maps leading to revised theoretical frameworks, reflected and evaluated the process of the action research and considered practice change or further research. This stage was a continued process of seeking to hear authentic voices, in depth discussion and reflection on what we were learning from disabled young people combined with our own knowledge, values, and beliefs. This led to the development of conceptual models and practical change intentions to promote social inclusion. Intentions to change included\n•Developing alternative social rooms with minimal TA presence\n•Including disabled young people in TA selection processes\n•Involving parents in reviewing the school inclusion policy\n•Establishing a regular parents’ support group\n•A commitment to keep listening to young people’s voices and preferences on key matters rather than ‘assuming that we already know!’ \n•Lengthening the lunch break in the specialist setting to ensure time for socialising and friendship building\n\nThese commitments to change demonstrated that schools were able to engage successfully in the action research process, valued parents’contributions further and were willing to change practice towards greater social inclusion of disabled young people and parents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hoskin, Claire","Macleod, Flora","Tunbridge, Margie"],"dc:date":"2010-05-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is generally accepted that earth materials have extreme\nvariations from point to point in space. Consequently this heterogeneity results in high\nvariation in hydraulic properties of soil. In order to develop a reliable predictive model for\ntransport processes in soil, the effects of this variability must be considered. Soil\nheterogeneity due to presence of macropores (micro-) and to spatial variability in hydraulic\nproperties (macro-heterogeneity) coexists in the real field conditions. The challenge is to\nincorporate the effects of both types of soil heterogeneity in simulation models.\nThis thesis presents development and application of a 2D/3D numerical model for\nsimulation of advection and diffusion-dispersion contaminant transport considering both\ntypes of soil heterogeneity. Stochastic finite element approach is used to incorporate the\neffects of the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties on contaminant fate. The soil\nmicro heterogeneity effects are modelled with a dual domain concept in which a first order\nkinetic expression is used to describe the transfer of the solute between the two domains.\nAlso, the capability of the model in 3D simulation of field problems improves the accuracy\nof the results, since it is possible to avoid the generally applied assumption in 2D\nsimulations.\nFrom comparison of the model results with experimental and analytical results, it is\nconcluded that the model performs well in predicting contaminant fate and the\nincorporation of the both types of micro- and macro- heterogeneity in the simulation\nmodels improves the accuracy of the prediction. Also, capability of the model in evaluation\nof the concentration variation coefficient as an index of reliability of the model outputs\nmakes it possible to estimate a probable interval (mean concentration minus and plus\nstandard deviation) for the range of oscillations of possible realizations of solute\ndistribution. Moreover, comparison of the results of the proposed method with the results\nobtained using the Monte Carlo approach yields a pronounced reduction in the computation\ncost while resulting in virtually the same response variability as the Monte Carlo technique.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mousavi Nezhad, Mohaddeseh","Javadi, Akbar","Butler, David"],"dc:date":"2010-07-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Criminal Identification in Liberal and Fascist Italy","bibo:abstract":"Between the end of the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century, criminal anthropology was a very influential theory for criminologists throughout the western world. Proposed by the Italian\nalienist Cesare Lombroso, its theoretical core centred on the figure of the “criminal man,” a character atavistic instinct forced to live a life of crime. By filling a gap in the literature, this work deals with the historical and sociological circumstances in which criminal anthropology emerged and prospered, and concentrates on the impact Lombroso’s theory had on the development of scientific policing in Italy since the beginning of the twentieth century. A detailed account of the causes that favoured the rise of Lombroso’s scientific police provides an explanation for the appeal\ncriminal anthropology exerted on western political elites. In Italy, the Lombrosian approach left his mark on the development of highly specific forensic tools like fingerprinting, and this had a strong\nimpact on their utilisation by fascist authorities as the account of a famous case of identity fraud occurred in Italy in 1927 revealed. As a result, it is argued that the production of Lombrosian scientific\npolicing was shaped by the wider cultural and social goals of the actors involved, as it is of any other form of knowledge. By choosing to sideline Lombrosian techniques, fascist authorities favoured the exploitation of un-scientific methods of crime prevention that, it is argued, were not\nperceived as inferior, anachronistic, or unreliable. Such a choice was dictated by specific social goals that favoured the implementation of constitutional anthropology on Lombrosian science of the\ndeviance. Finally, it is suggested that this socio-historical reading of the Italian case could cast more light on the complex relationship between totalitarianism, technology, and forms public surveillance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pagani, Massimiliano","Mazzotti, Massimo"],"dc:date":"2009-09-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Such work has not so far provided a hypothesis which satisfactorily explains the range of variations found. This study, grounded in an analysis based on the Advocacy Coalition Framework and the results of three case studies of events in the county boroughs of Plymouth and Exeter and in Devon County Council, uses a qualitative methodology developed by iteration between a deductive approach drawing on recent work and an inductive approach using a computer-assisted analysis of primary source material and proposes a new  hypothesis. \nThe hypothesis developed is that where a local authority inherited a Poor Law workhouse as a result of the Local Government Act (1929) development would be more likely to occur in places where councillors exhibited strong progressive beliefs in accountability to the wider community and in their social responsibility towards that community; where they had successful experience of direct hospital provision in other fields; and when they had available a committed entrepreneur able to marshal support for change within the council.\nIn addition to its empirical findings the study contributes to the development of public policy theory by suggesting improvements to the Advocacy Coalition Framework. Such improvements comprise recognition of the importance of ‘deep core’ as well as ‘policy core’ beliefs to policy change, consideration of path dependency as a significant method of policy learning, and of the roles of entrepreneurs and policy brokers. \nFinally the study draws attention to the relevance of the study to current practice in the implementation of public policy and proposes specifically that local NHS agencies should give greater prominence to identifying and supporting individuals with the skills of policy entrepreneurs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Neville, Julia","Dunlop, Claire A"],"dc:date":"2009-12-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

I examine the constructions of specific presidential mythologies based on the real presidencies of Kennedy, Nixon and Clinton and the construction of fictional presidencies in the television series The West Wing. In four sets of case studies, I will chart the changing significance of each president through different genres, looking particularly at how each presidential mythology is affected by the anxieties and fashions of the contemporary political and social world. I also examine the ways in which the appearance of presidentiality is created within each text by various means including set design, the choice of actor, the use of dialogue and the framing of particular characters. The aims of my thesis are to demonstrate how a telegenic style of politics formed during and after the Kennedy presidency can be seen to be both represented and enhanced in genre films and television series. I chart the relationship of this new mediated style of presidency through my case studies as it faces challenges such as Watergate, Clinton’s sex scandals and the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001.

In an attempt to fathom the real understanding of this rule, I have employed two methods: a critical approach to the darura theoretical discussions and an analysis of darura cases presented in fiqhi treatises. The study demonstrates that the usuliyun have formulated a narrow scope of darura theory although the applications of the rule in fiqhi treatises suggest other ways in which the principle can be applied. The jurists tend to apply the rule in a much wider sense in the various fiqhi  works, either in true and factual cases or in hypothetical ones. This research also finds that the modern jurists have expanded the application not only to protect the necessity of an individual person but to protect the necessity of the public at large. It can also be suggested that the rule of darura has provided measures derogating obligations; however, this must only be to the extent required by the exigencies of the situation.  A rigorous understanding of this rule is crucial for the field of Islamic law in order to avoid any possible abuse. Based on the above understanding of darura, this study finally investigates whether darura can justify the Harm Reduction Programme in Malaysia. This programme has been promulgated to reduce HIV/AIDS cases by providing drug users with methadone, syringes and needles. The programme was assessed thoroughly using the legal requirements and preconditions of darura.

The research presented in this thesis describes the development of a methodology for risk-based diagnostics of failures in WDS and its application in a near real-time Decision Support System (DSS) for WDS’ operation.\nIn this thesis, the use of evidential reasoning to estimate the likely location of a burst pipe within a WDS by combining outputs of several models is investigated. A novel Dempster-Shafer model is developed, which fuses evidence provided by a pipe burst prediction model, a customer contact model and a hydraulic model to increase confidence in correctly locating a burst pipe.\nA new impact model, based on a pressure driven hydraulic solver coupled with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to capture the adverse effects of failures from an operational perspective, is created. A set of Key Performance Indicators used to quantify impact, are aggregated according to the preferences of a Decision Maker (DM) using the Multi-Attribute Value Theory. The potential of distributed computing to deliver a near real-time performance of computationally expensive impact assessment is explored.\nA novel methodology to prioritise alarms (i.e., detected abnormal flow events) in a WDS is proposed. The relative significance of an alarm is expressed using a measure of an overall risk represented by a set of all potential incidents (e.g., pipe bursts), which might have caused it. The DM’s attitude towards risk is taken into account during the aggregation process.\nThe implementation of the main constituents of the proposed risk-based pipe burst diagnostics methodology, which forms a key component of the aforementioned DSS prototype, are tested on a number of real life and semi-real case studies. The methodology has the potential to enable more informed decisions to be made in the near real-time failure management in WDS.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bicik, Josef","Savic, Dragan","Kapelan, Zoran"],"dc:date":"2010-06-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The research was carried out using an interpretive paradigm and involved five multiple case studies to investigate the beliefs of five groups of Japanese language learners and teachers. The different groups were made up from seventeen secondary school students and twenty two university students located in Japan; four students studying in the UK; seven secondary school teachers of English who were also studying in the UK; and three university professors of English who taught in Japan. Data were collected from participants using open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The content analysis was based around six pre-determined themes and four emerging themes. \n\nThe findings revealed that certain beliefs, for example, optimistic beliefs and the commitment to a preferred model of learning English can negatively or positively impinge on the way individuals learn in different situations. The study also suggests that language learners need to have positive attitudes towards learning a language, but that each individual is motivated differently. Whether learners regard English as a subject at school or as a means of communication is likely to make a big difference to learners’ motivation to learn English. The role of aesthetic completeness in traditional Japanese arts might also negatively influence the attitudes of Japanese learners of English, in that their aspiration for precision can easily outrun their real linguistic ability, and in so doing make it more difficult for them to achieve proficiency in the use of language. With respect to teaching English, the study indicated the importance of understanding students’ beliefs in the educational context. It was also revealed that teachers’ beliefs have a great influence on learners’ progress or motivation for learning.\n\nThe implications of this study suggest that, as well as the consideration of individual differences, in the process of learning close attention should also be given to the psychological aspects that impinge on acquiring English in the context of Japanese culture.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kojima, Chizuyo","Burden, Robert","MacDonald, Malcolm"],"dc:date":"2009-09-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2804299,"sim:weight":0.280226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Consequently, during high-intensity exercise that mandates activation of fibres with considerable metabolic diversity (e.g., both principal fibre types), response characteristics specific to discrete segments of the recruited pool cannot be determined.  The purpose of this thesis was to identify fibre-type-specific effects of conditions that might impact O2 delivery and/or motor unit recruitment patterns on  O2 kinetics by using two models that increase fibre recruitment homogeneity during exercise transitions.  In four experiments, subjects initiated high-intensity exercise from a moderate baseline (i.e., performed ‘work-to-work’ transitions; M→H) to target higher-order fibres, and in two experiments, subjects cycled at extremely slow and fast pedal rates to skew recruitment toward slow- and fast-twitch fibres, respectively.  At mid-range contraction frequency,  O2 kinetics (as indicated by the primary time constant, τp) was slower for M→H compared to unloaded-to-high-intensity transitions (U→H) (e.g., 42 v. 33 s; Ch 4) and this slowing was ~50% greater for M→H in a supine body position (decreased oxygenation; Ch 6).  Slower kinetics was also present for U→H cycling at fast compared to slow pedal rates (τp, 48 v. 31 s; Ch 8).  Conversely, M→H slowing relative to U→H was absent at extreme cadences (36 v. 31 s and 53 v. 48 s for slow and fast, respectively; Ch 7).  After ‘priming’ (increased oxygenation), τp was reduced for U→H after fast-cadence priming only (Ch 8) and for M→H in the supine position (Ch 6), but unaffected for upright cycle and prone knee-extension M→H, for which priming reduced the  O2 slow component and delayed-onset fibre activation (as indicated by iEMG; Chs 4 and 5).  These results provide evidence in exercising humans that high-order fibres possess innately slow  O2 kinetics and are acutely susceptible to interventions that might alter O2 delivery to muscle.","bibo:AuthorList":["DiMenna, Fred J","Jones, Andrew M"],"dc:date":"2010-03-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The growing interest in\ninvestigating the relation between psychographics and consumer behaviours with\nregard to their purchase preferences has helped marketers in segmenting the market\nmore accurately so as to ensure certainty of profitability. This is especially relevant\nin the modern market where “crossing culture” (Davies and Fitchett, 2004, p.315)\nand acculturation, as well as the process of cultural integration, are common as a\nresult of many factors such as travelling both for leisure and business, emigration\nand re-location, etc. Nevertheless, these studies have mainly focussed on a single\ncommunity or ethnic group. This current study differs in that it attempts to compare\ntwo ethnic groups of diverse culture and religious background, i.e. the Malays and\nthe Chinese, within a single Malaysian community. The political and social\nenvironments in Malaysia make the current study unique in that the Malays receive\nfinancial aids and incentives from the ruling Malay-dominant government while the\nChinese have little or no assistance at all. Therefore, apart from looking at the\npsychographical aspects of consumption habit, the current study also includes\nsource of income as a variable factor in comparing the presume differences in\nspending between the two ethnic groups – the Malays receive extensive financial\naids and benefits from the ruling government while the Chinese work hard and save\nas much as possible to ensure a better future.\n5\nThe current study focuses on University Technologi Mara (UiTM) and University\nTunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) because of their respective racial composition of\nMalay and Chinese youths.\nThe findings in this study elucidate that there seems to be no apparent difference in\nspending behaviour between the Malays and the Chinese despite their cultural and\nreligious differences. This could be the result of the many years of co-existence and\nthe influence of global media and culture on both the Malay and Chinese youths.\nThe current study also does not find any strong basis in supporting the perception\nthat the Chinese would be more frugal in their spending because of unfavourable\neconomic support for them in the country. On the contrary, the study shows that the\nChinese are indeed financially wealthier than the Malays because of their life-long\nculture of prudence in savings. Another reason for this could be the failure of the\ngovernment’s New Economic Policy in addressing the economic needs of the\nmasses of the Malay population. Rather, the policy only favoured the selected few\nwith strong political link or clout.\nThis study also shows that there are significant differences in the spending\nbehaviour between the genders. This study also highlights the differences in\nspending behaviour of the cluster groups with their respective attached inherent\nvalue-traits. The study also reveals that the Malays are no longer the homogenous\ngroup as previously thought. Rather they indicate distinct differences in their\nspending behaviour.\nIt is hoped that in future, wider and in-depth studies can be conducted to further\nexamine the consumption behaviour of races according to their value-traits.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fatt Sian, Lai","Schroeder, Jonathan","Borgerson, Janet L."],"dc:date":"2009-09-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In this context, water reuse has emerged as a genuine and reliable alternative that can be used to supplement, and in some cases substitute traditional water sources.  \n\nThe practice of water reclamation and reuse has developed tremendously in the last century.  With the rate of growth projected to increase even further, water reuse schemes of larger size will have to be planned, addressing an ever expanding list of technological, environmental, social and financial considerations.  Therefore, decision support systems (DSS) are acutely needed to assist the planners of future water reuse schemes.\n\nThe DSS developed in this thesis and embodied in the WTRNet (Water Treatment for Reuse with Network Distribution) software tool takes into account the interactions that exist between the individual schemes components (treatment trains, distribution system and end-users of reclaimed water) in evaluation and selection of most promising design alternatives. Comprising of a simulation and optimisation components, the DSS provides a user-friendly platform for evaluation and optimisation of integrated water reuse schemes.\n\nThe numbers of potential design alternatives for schemes of different size are determined, and are shown to be substantially reduced by using rules that determine feasible treatment trains.  Optimisation algorithms appropriate for schemes of different size are developed and tested on case studies to verify the DSS, which includes a novel and efficient linear programming methodology of least-cost sizing of reclaimed water distribution systems.\n\nThe benefits of evaluation in the proposed manner are demonstrated by deriving optimal water reuse schemes for the City of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.  The results of application of WTRNet on the case study indicate that the selection of optimal treatment alternatives based on different criteria has potentially significant effect on the cost of optimal alternatives, and that the selection of end-users requires a structured approach that takes into account factors other than their demand and location relative to the source.","bibo:AuthorList":["Joksimovic, Darko","Savic, Dragan"],"dc:date":"2007-01-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It takes place at a small rural community college in California, in which the majority population is Hispanic. The study relies primarily on quantitative methods, but includes a small qualitative component in the form of focus group interviews to confirm and enhance the findings. There were several main findings in the sample studied. Women scored significantly higher in mathematics anxiety than males among all age groups, ethnicities, and mathematics levels. Furthermore, the size of the gender gap in mathematics anxiety was not affected by age, ethnicity, or mathematics level. Significant relationships were found between mathematics anxiety and test anxiety, worry, emotionality, trait anxiety, self-confidence in mathematics, effectance motivation in mathematics, perceived usefulness of mathematics, and number of years of high school mathematics. Moreover, these relationships appeared to be approximately the same across samples of females and males, regardless of age, ethnicity, or mathematics level. Among the significant predictors of mathematics anxiety of particular importance were a lack of self-confidence in mathematics, a high presence of test anxiety—specifically emotionality—and a low presence of effectance motivation in mathematics. Follow-up focus group interviews suggested additional factors that could be related to mathematics anxiety, among which were an unpleasant experience with mathematics at the elementary or junior high school level, the requirement of having to follow precise steps in obtaining an exact answer, and the perception that the terminology of the mathematical language was confusing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hathaway, Stewart","Ernest, Paul"],"dc:date":"2008-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This study also sets out to uncover, and to gain an in-depth understanding of further issues which emerged from the dissonance between the teachers’ beliefs and their practice. Following a discussion of the English teaching and assessment context, the first part of the study examines mainstream theories of language testing or assessment; it then considers how closely classroom-based assessment in Korean primary schools conforms to these theoretical principles. The second part of the study presents a small-scale research project. Four stages in teachers’ classroom-based assessment were examined; planning, implementation, monitoring, and recording and dissemination. A questionnaire was developed reflecting these stages; its findings were analyzed statically and qualitatively. Further qualitative data was also collected and analyzed through interviews with volunteer participants. This is based on an analysis of teachers’ firsthand experience and their opinions of the assessment of English as a foreign language.\n\nThe results of the study revealed that generally the teachers hold and exercise their own firm beliefs regarding classroom-based assessment, and have a good knowledge of assessment or testing principles; thus they carried out their assessment using appropriate procedures taking into account the context of English teaching and assessment in which they operate. However, there were a number of issues which emerged from their assessment beliefs and their practice. It became clear that they did not put some of their principles into practice; a number of important factors, which are normally outside the teachers’ control, were found to be responsible for this, these include: overcrowded classrooms, heavy teaching loads, the central bureaucracy of the education system which controls primary education, and a shortage of funding for foreign language teaching. Teachers were also affected by the rather complex relationship with other teachers, head teachers, and even the parents of the students. However, it is evident that the teachers are constantly developing their skills and knowledge regarding assessment in order to address any possible challenges or tasks given to them. In addition, certain areas needing further investigation were identified. Based on the literature review and the findings of the research, tentative implications and recommendations for the development of classroom-based language assessment are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["SHIM, Kyu Nam","MacDonald, Malcolm","Troudi, Salah"],"dc:date":"2008-12-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Interest in the biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and compounds (PAHs/PACs) is motivated by their ubiquitous distribution, their low bioavailability, high persistence in soils and their potentially deleterious effects to human health. Identifying the diversity of microorganisms that degrade PAHs/PACs can be utilised in the development of bioremediation techniques. Understanding the mechanisms of bacterial populations to adapt to the presence of pollutants and the extent that lateral transfer of key functional genes occurs, will allow the exploitation of microbial PAC/PAH-degradative capabilities and therefore enhance the successful application of bioremediation strategies.\n\nA key aim of this study was to isolate and identify PAC-degrading bacteria for potential use in future bioremediation programmes. A series of PAC enrichments were established under the same experimental conditions from a single sediment sample taken from a highly polluted estuarine site. Distinct microbial community shifts were directly attributable to enrichment with different PAC substrates. The findings of this study demonstrate that five divisions of the Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria can degrade PACs. By determining the precise identity of the PAC-degrading bacteria isolated, and by comparing these with previously published research, this study showed how bacteria with similar PAC degrading capabilities and 16S rRNA signatures are found in similarly polluted environments in geographically very distant locations e.g. China, Italy, Japan and Hawaii. Such a finding suggests that geographical barriers do not limit the distribution of key PAC-degrading bacteria. This is significant when considering the diversity and global distribution of microbes with PAC-degradative capabilities and the potential for utilising these microbial populations in future bioremediation strategies.\n\nIn the laboratory, enrichment of bacteria able to utilise PAHs has commonly been performed in liquid media, with the PAH dissolved in a carrier solvent. This study found the presence of a carrier solvent significantly affects the resultant microbial population. Although the same sediment sample was used as the bacterial source in all enrichments, different bacterial strains were obtained depending upon the presence of the carrier solvent and the PAH. This is important when considering appropriate methodology for the isolation of PAH-degrading bacteria for future bioremediation programmes. Additionally, the species comprising the resultant population of the enrichment when a carrier solvent was present were similar to previously reported PAH-degrading species. Such a finding necessitates review of previously reported PAH-degrading bacterial species that have been isolated and identified from enrichments using a carrier solvent.\n\nUnderstanding how bacteria acclimatise to environmental pollutants is vital for exploiting these mechanisms within clear up strategies of contaminated sites. Two major lineages of the α subunit of PAH dioxygenases were identified: Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Comparison of the α subunit phylogeny with the 16S rRNA phylogeny implies that the PAH-dioxygenases evolved prior to the separation of these phyla or that lateral transfer occurred in the very distant past. No evidence for lateral transfer of the α subunit between the Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria was found in the phylogenetic analyses of this research. Multiple lateral transfer events were inferred between the species of the Actinobacteria and between the classes of the Proteobacteria. The clustering of the taxa within the α subunit phylogeny indicates that lateral transfer of the α subunit gene occurred after the separation of the classes of Proteobacteria and also after the speciation of the γ-Proteobacteria. These findings reveal how bacteria have acclimatised to PAH pollutants through multiple lateral transfer events of a key PAH-degradative gene. This knowledge of the transfer of genetic material will broaden our prospects of exploiting microbial populations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Long, Rachel May","Lappin-Scott, Hilary","Stevens, Jamie"],"dc:date":"2008-11-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Despite extensive physiological research, there are few investigations of these practices regarding their socio-cultural practice. This qualitative sociological study examines long-term British practitioners’ experiences of transformation via Taijiquan (Tai Chi) and Wing Chun by addressing five issues: 1) Rationales behind practice 2) Resulting transformations 3) Explicit/implicit pedagogic strategies 4) Cultural transmission 5) Relations to broader social life. It approaches these questions through an emergent research design incorporating autobiographical vignettes as a practitioner-teacher-researcher, life histories of experienced practitioners and ethnographic fieldwork of two case study schools. Following thematic, metaphorical and narrative analysis, a structurationist theoretical framework illuminates the data by incorporating sensitising concepts from diverse thinkers including Bourdieu, Frank, Giddens and Yuasa. The findings are represented through autobiographical, modified realist, impressionist and confessional writing and structure the thesis as follows: Firstly, my own story demonstrates shifts in transformation from a technique-orientated approach to a more spiritual/holistic perspective, finally emerging as a scholarly position of a thinker-martial artist. Secondly, practitioner case studies further articulate transformations along a flexible continuum of changing body-self-society relations interpreted here as three ideal types: Fighters, martial artists and thinkers. Thirdly, the connecting pedagogical issues are addressed, as well-rounded TCMA systems possess specific partner exercises to develop intercorporeal awareness and embodied sensitivity, which are explicit aspects of each association’s martial habitus and body lineage. Meanwhile, socio-linguistic metaphors articulate these transformations and are also interpreted as transformations in thinking and schemes of perception. Overall, these sensitising concepts and empirical findings offer a social theory of shared cultivation that acknowledges transformation on individual, relational, institutional and art levels. This shared cultivation framework may be useful for future methodological, theoretical and empirical considerations of wider physical culture. \nKey words: Autobiography, Body-self transformation, Chinese martial arts, cultural transmission, ethnography, life histories, qualitative research, sociology, shared cultivation","bibo:AuthorList":["Jennings, George Bradley","Brown, David"],"dc:date":"2010-08-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Using data on VC investments in 55 countries from 1995 to 2008, this dissertation contributes to that debate by examining the effect of a country’s legal, regulatory, and fiscal environment on VC investments. In addition, I explore whether governments can establish a domestic VC industry or attract foreign VC funding via targeted policy reforms. The results of this study suggest that VC investment flows are significantly affected by a country’s institutional environment. In addition, they suggest that the judicial independence of a country’s courts and the adaptability of its laws have a strong influence on the country’s attractiveness for VC investors. Moreover, VC investments are strongly affected by macroeconomic, political, and cultural factors, confirming the results of prior studies in the VC literature. Finally, I show that bankruptcy law reforms, VC-related pension fund regulations, and fiscal reforms are important tools whereby governments can attract and retain domestic and foreign VC investors – a result that should be of much interest to policy makers.

It also examines the Chinese business environment for the development of the FITS sector in the country. The investigation was conducted through some focused aspects, including different roles of three major locations; the setup and licensing process in the FITS sector; the FITSs’ original countries and relative features; their ownership and management structures; their major target markets and profitability; the FITS’s HR strategies on the local employment; the relationships between the FITS sector and the indigenous services, and the overall environment, as well as the opportunities and challenges for the sector’s development in China. The research focuses on three locations, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong province which host almost all the FITS companies (27 registered in total) in China in the decade. The methodology combines the study of both primary and secondary data, with interviews being undertaken with the FITSs (29 formal interviews with 14 FITSs) and a questionnaire survey towards 150 Chinese travel services in the locations.\n \nGiven the understanding of existing literature on the travel trade business, FDI, China’s economic and political foundations, and the opening of the Chinese tourism industry, the thesis argues that the development of the FITS sector in China was substantially constrained and shaped by the protectionist policies of the Chinese government in the first opening decade. The government’s strong power through policies and SOEs is also one of the most considerable challenges for FITSs in China. However, the FITS companies were not passive actors in this situation, but developed a range of strategies in response to the changing regulatory framework, which effectively shaped a rapidly emerging sector and its relations with endogenous companies. The research is important also because there are positive opportunities in the country for the future development of the FITS sector, in response to anticipated further opening of the market.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yu, Jian","Shaw, Gareth"],"dc:date":"2010-08-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Three broad questions are put forward in this study: \n\n1. To what extent can international practice as adopted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in its registration and management practices offer a constructive perspective on Palestinian refugee registration procedures and data? \n\n2. What is the relevance of the experience gained in the settlement of refugee claims in international settings, such as the practice of international Claim Commissions in search of guidelines for the planning of a future Palestinian Claim Commission? \n\n3. Can existing Palestinian refugee registration data be constructed in a suitable way for the preparation of future claims? \n\nOn a broader level, the study will seek to explore two questions. Firstly, can Palestinian refugee registration data point towards findings that could contribute, by making available to negotiators, the quantitative data necessary for determining claims? Secondly, can international guidelines provide a framework for the use of Palestinian registration data in confronting refugee claims and losses?\n\nThe study also takes on a technical analysis. The case studies subject to the analysis are Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Kosovo. Via this approach, the research will study the general norms and procedures adopted by two Claims Commissions to resolve refugee claims. Insights are then made into the possible transfer of such procedures to the Palestinian refugee case. In doing so, a clearer picture of how a future Palestinian Claims Commission could be established, and how existing Palestinian refugee registration data could be assembled, is then examined.\nThis thesis argues that one of the major gaps in research on Palestinian refugees is that it has not benefited from the experience of international lesson-learning through the analysis of other refugee cases and especially the utilization of the experience of UNHCR and precedents set by international Claim Commissions. The study’s main conclusion is that international guidelines and precedents have significant benefits for preparing Palestinian refugee registration data, in reaching future claims for compensation within the Arab-Israeli negotiations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Irving-Jones, Nerys","Dumper, Michael"],"dc:date":"2008-05-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Samples were drawn from both genders in two dissimilar academic programs: the university preparatory intensive English program (IEP) and the mainstream science program.  Specifically, this study focuses on the characteristics of effective and ineffective teaching from the point of view of four population groups: English students, English faculty, science students and science faculty.  The method of enquiry made use of both interviews and a questionnaire. Means, ranking, and standard deviation followed by other analyses indicated that there was a high degree of similarity between students and faculty with respect to the perceived attributes of effective and ineffective teaching.  It appears that the effective teacher is the mirror image of the ineffective by being imbued with a generous dose of personality traits in addition to skills.  Both faculty and students in this research conducted in the Gulf depicted the excellent university professor as someone who: (1) is respectful, (2) makes classes interesting, (3) is fair in evaluating, (4) cares about students’ success, (5) shows a love for their subject, (6) is friendly, (7) encourages questions and discussion, (8) is always well prepared and organized, and (9) makes difficult subjects easy to learn.  Findings of students’ and faculty’s perspectives suggest that effective teaching is the blending of both personality and ability factors.  The key factor, however, remains the teacher’s personality.","bibo:AuthorList":["Raymond, Sylvie Marguerite","McDonald, Malcolm","Troudi, Salah"],"dc:date":"2008-05-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

There have been a number of research studies examining the factors that mediate these outcomes (see Appendix A for a summary in the literature review) and some studies have taken a particular interest in young people who have succeeded “against the odds” or shown resilience to the risk factors in their lives (Jackson, Ajayi \u0026 Quigley, 2005). Alongside this, the previous Labour government (Tony Blair 1997-2007; Gordon Brown 2007-2010) made it a high priority to close the gap between the outcomes of Children in Care (CiC) and that of all other children. Part of this agenda was to encourage young people from a care background to enter into further education pathways (for example, the Aim Higher project and recently From Care2Work: National Care Advisory Service (NCAS), 2010), for them to have higher hopes, dreams and aspirations for the future.\nThe literature review for this study revealed that there have been no studies that specifically look at the aspirations of CiC, as such it was felt that this would be a valuable addition to current knowledge. Furthermore, the literature on resilience tended to focus on risk and resilience factors identified in the lives of CiC and not on the lived experiences of the young people, hence it was felt that a valuable contribution to current knowledge would be to use a phenomenological methodology to seek the perspectives of young people in care on resilience. It was felt that by looking in detail at the aspirations and resilience of a group of young people in care, a more holistic perspective could be gained on why the outcomes of CiC are so poor. Consequently, the aims of the first paper were to identify what aspirations young people in care hold, the factors that influenced them and the plans they have to achieve them, as well as what they felt was most important for the development of high aspirations. The aims of the second study were to elicit the positive and negative experiences of a group of young people in care, to determine what strategies these young people used to cope with difficult situations and to map out what factors these young people thought led to good educational and vocational outcomes versus poor outcomes for people who have tough lives.\nBoth studies used data collected from a semi-structured interview with 16 secondary aged and three post 16 young people in the care of one Local Authority. The interview had specific questions related to each of the aims from both studies. All the data collected was qualitative and the analysis used in paper one was thematic analysis, while paper two used Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The reason for using two different analyses was because the focus in paper one was to gather information to form a model that could be generalised to all CiC; as such it took a more reductionist approach. The second paper, on the other hand, was focussed on detailing the experiences and perceptions of resilience that young people in care had; as such it sought to show the rich tapestry of their experiences and not to reduce their experiences to the smallest common denominator.\nThe results from paper one showed that the young people did have high aspirations, which varied according to gender and age, and plans to achieve these goals. Most of the young people relied on themselves to develop their aspirations and achieve their goals, however, family, school friends and past personal experiences also played key roles. They felt that personal factors were most important in developing high aspirations, followed by social factors, while education and life events had minor roles.\nThe results of the second study showed that the young people identified supportive networks (peers and adults), education, positive personal qualities, advice and resources, positive experiences (e.g. achievements) and having their basic and emotional needs met as being protective factors that promote resilient outcomes. While poor interactions and relationships, unsupportive adults, experiences of entering care, loss, negative personal qualities, poor education, overwhelming emotions, memories and lack of control over thoughts, life events, and home experiences as being risk factors and promoting poor outcomes.\nThe results of both studies are relevant both on a theoretical level and a practical level. Theoretically, the first study has contributed to the lack of knowledge of how aspirations are formed in CiC. However, further study is needed before a model can be proposed. On a practical level, the results are useful in highlighting to those who work with CiC the areas that influence them in developing aspirations and the factors that are important in developing high aspirations so that support can be targeted in these areas. The second study has contributed to looking at resilience from the perspective of a young person in care, and while the findings are mostly consistent with current knowledge, the emphasis of the young people on ‘self’ helps us to understand the processes of how young people in care cope with and overcome difficulties – that is that they are relying on themselves and so on a practical level either support should focus on making them better equipped at dealing with their difficulties or it should go into creating a more supportive network across the domains and systems that the young people live in.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carvalho, Alice","Avramidis, Elias","Tunbridge, Margie"],"dc:date":"2010-06-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The PMK1 (Pathogenicity Mitogen-activated protein Kinase) gene in M. oryzae has been identified to play diverse roles during pathogenesis-related development. PMK1 regulates appressorium formation and infectious hyphal growth. PMK1 is functionally related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae FUS3 and KSS1 MAPK genes which regulate the transcription factor Ste12. The STE12 homologue in M. oryzae, MST12, has also been identified and is known to be essential for appressorium mediated penetration and infectious growth. These observations imply that Pmk1 regulates a diverse set of targets important in both the initiation of appressorium development and the subsequent stages of invasive growth. In addition, the Mst12 transcription factor may function downstream of Pmk1 to regulate genes involved in appressorial penetration and infectious hyphal growth. We have used a comparative proteomic study between Guy11 (isogenic wild type), ∆mst12 and ∆pmk1 mutants to understand which genes are induced during appressorium formation and may be regulated by Mst12 and Pmk1. We carried out two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with proteins extracted from conidia that had germinated on a hydrophobic surface after 6h, 12h, 16h and 24h of incubation. M. oryzae underwent major changes in protein abundance and expression during the first 6 hours of spore germination in Guy11 which suggested that much of protein synthesis associated with appressorium morphogenesis and virulence occurs precociously during conidium germination on rice leaf surface. More than 394 differentially expressed proteins during conidium germination and appressorium formation have been identified by mass spectrometry. We confirmed many proteins already known as determinants of pathogenicity in M. oryzae such as enzymes involved in melanin biosynthesis or fatty acid β-oxidation. However, we also identified proteins absent or lowly induced in the Δpmk1 and Δmst12 mutants involved in cell wall reorganisation, secondary metabolism, lipid metabolism, photomorphogenesis or found as proteins of unknown functions. We generated 28 targeted gene deletion mutants to test the putative function of proteins predicted by proteomics analysis to be associated with appressorium development. We obtained 7 mutants showing a significant reduction in virulence and confirmed importance of regulated proteolysis during appressorium development but also elucidated new processes involved in infection such as the phosphoinositide pathway and three proteins of unknown function.","bibo:AuthorList":["Huguet, Romain","Talbot, Nicholas J."],"dc:date":"2010-08-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The relatively sporadic occurrence of such large\nscale animal disease outbreaks makes determination of optimal control policies difficult,\nand policy makers must balance the relative impacts of different response strategies based\non little prior information. It is in this situation that the use of mathematical and statistical\nmodelling techniques can provide powerful insights into the future course of an\ninfectious epidemic.\nThe motivating example for this thesis is the outbreak of FMD in Devon in 2001, however\nwe are interested in developing more general techniques that can be applied to other\nanimal diseases. Many of the models fitted to the 2001 UK FMD data set have focussed\non modelling the global spread of the disease across the entire country and then using\nthese models to assess the effects of nationwide response strategies. However it has been\nshown that the dynamics of the disease are not uniform across the whole of the UK and\ncan vary significantly across different spatial regions. Of interest here is exploring whether\nmodelling at a smaller spatial scale can provide more useful measures of risk and guide\nthe development of more efficient control policies.\nWe begin by introducing some of the main epidemiological issues and concepts involved\nin modelling infectious animal diseases, from the microscopic through to the farm population\nlevel. We then discuss the various mathematical modelling techniques that have\napplied previously and how they relate to various biological principals discussed in the\nearlier chapters. We then highlight some limitations with these approaches and offer potential\nways in which survival analysis techniques could be used to overcome some of these\nproblems.\nTo this end we formulate a spatial survival model and fit it to the Devon data set with\nsome naive initial covariates that fail to capture the dynamics of the disease. Some work\nby colleagues at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge (Arnold 2005), produced\nestimates of viral excretion rates for infected herds of different species type over time,\nand these form the basis for the development of a dynamic space-time varying viral load\ncovariate that quantifies the viral load acting at any spatial location at any point in time.\nThe novel use of this covariate as a means of censoring the data set via exposure is then\nintroduced, though the models still fail to explain the variation in the epidemic process.\nTwo potential reasons for this are identified - the possible presence of non-localised infections\nand/or premise varying susceptibility. We then explore ways in which the survival\napproach can be extended to model more than one epidemic process through the use of\nmixture and long-term survivor models. Some simple simulations suggest that resistance\nto infection is the most likely cause of the poor model fits, and a series of more complex\nsimulation experiments show that both the mixture and long-term survivor models offer\nvarious advantages over the conventional approach when resistance is present in the data\nset. However key to their performance is the ability to correctly capture the mixing, although\nin the worst case scenario they still replicate the results from the conventional\nmodel.\nWe also use these simulations to explore potential ways in which space-time predictions\nof the hazard of infection can be used as a means of targeting control policies to areas of\n‘high-risk’ of infection. This shows the importance of ensuring that the scale of the control\norder matches the scale of the epidemic, and suggests possible dangers when using global\nlevel models to derive response strategies for situations where the dynamics of the disease\nchange at smaller spatial scales. Finally we apply these techniques to the Devon data set\nand offer some conclusions and future work.","bibo:AuthorList":["McKinley, Trevelyan John","Bailey, Trevor C."],"dc:date":"2007-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These factors, alongside the longevity of her Society of the Inner Light (still flourishing), are the catalysts for my embarking on this thesis.  \n\tChapter 1 discusses the method of approach, covers Fortune’s definitions of frequent occult terms, and compares observations of her work by fellow occultists and outside observers. Chapter 2 is a comprehensive review of mainly recent academic research into the role of intermediaries in magic and religion from ancient times, and serves as a background to Fortune’s own esoteric philosophy, showing that she was heir to a tradition with a long history. Chapter 3 reviews those features of her early history relevant to her occult involvement to and her literary output and training, with special reference to her teachers and collaborators. \n\tThe composition and content of the Inner Worlds is contained in Fortune’s understanding of the Kabbalah and the glyph of the Tree of Life, which served as a most important framework for classifying the range of beings said to inhabit the invisible worlds. Chapter 4 therefore clarifies her contribution to Western Esoteric Kabbalah by comparing it with the work of others, showing how she consolidated and added to existing knowledge, producing what was acknowledged as a groundbreaking exegesis in its day. Chapter 5 compares Fortune’s viewpoint with that of major British occultists concerning the identity, nature and tasks of the Masters of Wisdom, leading into Chapter 6, which investigates techniques and methods that Fortune and others have found favourable for contacting them.

Similarly, even very simple sparsity-based\ndenoising techniques, such as classical wavelet shrinkage, can produce\nsurprisingly good results on a wide variety of different signals, because,\nunlike noise, most signals of practical interest share vital\ncharacteristics (such as smoothness, or the ability to be well\napproximated by piece-wise linear polynomials of a low order) that allow a\nsparse representation in wavelet space. On the other hand results obtained\nfrom SVMs (and classical wavelet-shrinkage) suffer from a certain lack of\ninterpretability, since one cannot straightforwardly attach probabilities\nto them. By contrast regression, and even more importantly classification,\nin a Bayesian context always entails a probabilistic measure of confidence\nin the results, which, provided the model assumptions are reasonably\naccurate, forms a basis for principled decision-making. The relevance\nvector machine (RVM) combines these strengths by explicitly encoding the\ncriterion of model sparsity as a (Bayesian) prior over the model weights\nand offers a single, unified paradigm to efficiently deal with regression\nas well as classification tasks. However the lack of an explicit prior\nstructure over the weight variances means that the degree of sparsity is\nto a large extent controlled by the choice of kernel (and kernel\nparameters). This can lead to severe overfitting or oversmoothing --\npossibly even both at the same time (e.g. for the multiscale Doppler\ndata). This thesis details an efficient scheme to control sparsity in\nBayesian regression by incorporating a flexible noise-dependent smoothness\nprior into the RVM. The resultant smooth RVM (sRVM) encompasses the\noriginal RVM as a special case, but empirical results with a variety of\npopular data sets show that it can surpass RVM performance in terms of\ngoodness of fit and achieved sparsity as well as computational performance\nin many cases. As the smoothness prior effectively makes it possible to\nuse (highly efficient) wavelet kernels in an RVM setting this work also\nunveils a strong connection between Bayesian wavelet shrinkage and RVM\nregression and effectively further extends the applicability of the RVM to\ndenoising tasks for up to millions of datapoints. We further discuss its\napplicability to classification tasks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schmolck, Alexander","Everson, Richard"],"dc:date":"2008-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Both esteemed the Alps in their own way, although Ruskin’s cultural aestheticism contrasting markedly to the popular showmanship of Smith. Nevertheless, both Ruskin’s five-volumed Modern Painters (1843-1860), and Smith’s theatrical shows describing his ascent of Mont Blanc (1852-1858), contributed significantly to the growing popularity of the landscape resulting in the Alpine Club (1857) and the birth of modern tourism in the region. \n\nThis work examines in detail the work and interests of both characters. This includes Ruskin’s drawings, art theory (especially in relation to his admiration of Turner), geological interests, religious convictions, and poetry. These reveal his desire to centre ideas of the sublime around his scientific interest in the area and the legacy of his Evangelical upbringing. The thesis investigates the tension between these elements. Smith’s climb of Mont Blanc (1851) and his subsequent shows highlighted his desire to thrill and entertain. For him, presentation of the Alps was a matter of showmanship and the thesis investigates his success, tracing its roots in elements of Victorian popular entertainment. Both Smith’s shows, and works like Of Mountain Beauty (Volume IV of Modern Painters (1856)), inspired many to explore the landscape for themselves. For Ruskin, this led to a decline in his interest in the Alps following the development of the rail network and the expansion of popular tourist sites, including his beloved Chamonix. For Smith, the public’s increasing familiarity with the region, and the popularity of other stories of Alpine ascents by members of the Alpine Club, led to a decline in interest in his shows by the end of the 1850s. \n\nDue to their interest in the region, the Romantic appreciation of the Alps in the early nineteenth century associated with theories of the sublime became a much more diverse phenomenon illustrating a number of key features of Victorian culture, including: the relationship of ‘high’ and ‘popular’ culture; the increasing influence of mass tourism; and the ways in which major figures in Victorian Britain explored and utilised foreign destinations. The thesis will also, from time to time, examine the relationship between cultural and visual forms and key elements in Victorian intellectual controversy, including the relationship of religion and science.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bevin, Darren James","Rylance, Rick"],"dc:date":"2008-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The first experimental paper examined the reliability of measuring parameters of muscle metabolism in 11-12 year old children over three exhaustive incremental tests using a single-legged quadriceps ergometer. Exercise performance (peak power: ~ 10% coefficient of variation [CV]) and metabolic variables (muscle phosphate and pH intracellular thresholds [IT]: ~ 10% CV, and pH: ~ 1% CV at exhaustion) demonstrated good reliability, whereas the ratio of inorganic phosphate to phosphocreatine (Pi/PCr) at exhaustion had poor reproducibility (~ 50% CV). The second paper examined the influence of age and sex on the muscle metabolic responses during incremental exercise in 9-12 year old children and young adults. The Pi/PCr and pH responses before and at the ITs were independent of age and sex, although during exercise above the ITs, the anaerobic energy contribution (increase in Pi/PCr, fall in pH) was higher in adults than children and in females compared with males, indicating an intensity dependence on age- and sex-related differences in muscle energetics. The third paper examined the relationship between the dynamics of muscle PCr, a putative controller of muscle respiration, and pulmonary oxygen uptake (pVO2) in 9-10 year old children during moderate intensity quadriceps and cycling exercise respectively. No differences were found between the PCr and phase II VO2 time constants at the onset (PCr 23 s [SD 5] vs. pVO2 23 s [SD 4]; P\u003d1.000) or offset (PCr 28 s [SD 5] vs. pVO2 29 s [SD 5]; P\u003d1.000) of exercise, suggesting an age-related slowing of the phosphate linked controller(s) of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation may underlie the faster pVO2 kinetics found in children compared to adults. The final experimental chapter tested this hypothesis, but no age or sex related differences were found in the PCr kinetic time constant at the onset (boys: 21 s [SD 4]; girls: 24 s [SD 5]; men: 26 s [SD 9]; women: 24 s [SD 7], P\u003e0.200) or offset (boys: 26 s [SD 5]; girls: 29 s [SD 7]; men: 23 s [SD 9]; women: 29 s [SD 7], P\u003e0.070) of exercise. In conclusion, this thesis has demonstrated that muscle metabolic parameters determined by 31P-MRS are suitable for the study of developmental exercise metabolism.

It attends to the way in which particular representations of Algerian violence were problematised within, and cross-problematised with, prevailing international security discourses and practices, especially the concurrently emergent litterature on civil wars and armed humanitarian intervention. Unsatisfied with general international response to the conflict in Algeria in the 1990s, particularly the major massacres of 1997 and 1998, this study questions how certain problematisations were used to understand the violence and how those renderings contributed to the troubled relationship between the representation of mass violence in Algeria and international efforts to intervene against it. \n\nAs a study in politiography, the primary object of analysis here is not the entire discursive field of Algerian violence but rather select yet influential scholarly texts within the genre of late Algerian violence. While these works helped co-constitute the broader discursive formations of Algerian violence that enabled its own representation as such, this examination does not necessarily address them vis-à-vis unique, superior or competing representations drawn from the traditionally privileged sites of initial discursive production of international security. The primary method of critique here is deconstructive in so far as it simply uses the texts — their arguments, their evidence and their archival logic — against themselves. Borrowing insights from currents in recent neopragmatist thought, this study seeks to reverse engineer some of the more dominant international problematisations of Algerian violence, so as to unearth the deeper politics of naming built into specific representations of Algeria and more generic frameworks of international security. \n\nAfter first exploring the conflict’s contested political and economic etiology (chapter three), as well as its disputed classification as a civil war (chapter four), this study closely examines the interpretations of the most intense civilian massacres, those that occurred between August 1997 and January 1998 (chapters five and six). How these representations resulted in the threat of (armed) humanitarian intervention are of particular concern (chapter seven), as are the ways in which foreign actors have attempted to historically contextualise Algeria’s alleged tradition and culture of violence (chapter eight). The aim is not to produce — though it cannot but help contribute to — a new history or account of the politics of the Algerian conflict and its internationalisation. The intent is first to underscore the inherent yet potentially auspicious dangers within all problematisations of mass violence. Secondly, it is to advocate for ironic forms of politiography, given the politics always-already embedded within acts of naming, particularly when it comes to questions of mass violence. A politiography that is able to appreciate the contingency of representation and intervention, and so underscores the need for a more deliberately and deliberative ethical and democratic politics of representation in the face of atrocity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mundy, Jacob Andrew","Stansfield, Gareth"],"dc:date":"2010-07-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5227169,"sim:weight":0.342329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.321164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109074,"sim:weight":0.272915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734404,"sim:weight":0.271227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929831,"sim:weight":0.234865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85630,"sim:weight":0.167441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Effort has been made to use calculated results to explain experimentally observed phenomena.  The behaviour of vacancies and vacancy clusters in germanium has been studied as these are the dominant intrinsic defects in the material. Particular attention was paid to the annealing mechanisms for the divacancy as a precursor to the growth of the larger clusters, for which the electrical properties\nand formation energies have been studied.  Some preliminary work is also presented on the germanium self-interstitial structure and migration paths.\nAttention was then turned to a selection of dopant-vacancy defects in both silicon and germanium. An effort was made to explain recent experimental observations in silicon through investigating a number of defects related to the arsenic E-centre. Following this, the properties of donor-vacancy clusters in germanium were studied, and comparison with the results calculated\nfor silicon suggest a significant parallel between the behaviour of the defects and dopants in the two materials.\nFinally, extensive work was performed on the diffusion of phosphorus and boron in germanium. Diffusion of both dopants was studied via interstitial and vacancy mediated paths as well as by a correlated exchange path not involving any intrinsic defects. The results obtained confirmed current theories\nof the mechanisms involved in the diffusion of the two defects, while also expanding the knowledge of other paths and giving Fermi level dependences for the energy and mechanism for diffusion of the two defects. Boron diffusion was found to exhibit strong Meyer-Neldel rule effects, which are used to explain the unusually high diffusivity prefactors and energy barriers calculated from experimental measurements for this dopant.","bibo:AuthorList":["Janke, Colin","Jones, Robert"],"dc:date":"2008-08-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9543946,"sim:weight":0.431396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9543968,"sim:weight":0.395696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9543963,"sim:weight":0.32645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9543919,"sim:weight":0.306351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108606,"sim:weight":0.220563,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26619,"sim:weight":0.183412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108788,"sim:weight":0.171633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108299,"sim:weight":0.165129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108050,"sim:weight":0.16002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108364,"sim:weight":0.150817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26377,"sim:weight":0.132494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108676,"sim:weight":0.131559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108874,"sim:weight":0.116687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

When applied to the treatment and prevention of disease and for pathology in general, biophotonics offers a means to bridge the gap between understanding of molecular structures and their role in physiological functions.  There is a wide range of such techniques used in imaging, assaying, bio-sensing, optical diagnosis, each of which has limitations as well as benefits.  The experiments outlined in this thesis use nanotechnology to overcome the limitations of resolution, contrast and chemical specificity with photonic techniques in biology.\n\nThe experimental work outlined in this thesis is divided over three chapters, the first of which is concerned with nanostructured metallic surfaces for use in surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for protein assay applications.  This chapter gives details of the methods used to produce and characterise SERS substrates using gold and silver thermally evaporated onto butterfly wing sections, together with the protocols developed for manufacturing biomimetic analogues of these naturally occurring nanostructures.  The conjugation system designed to modify the metal surfaces for use in an avidin/biotin model protein binding assay is described, together with an account of the efficacy of the final assay.  The results obtained show that such naturally occurring nanostructures, and their biomimetic analogues, are suitable for use as SERS substrates for wet protein binding assays.

The reason for this impasse is the inability of film theory and music theory to relate to one another because of their lack of a common theoretical language. It is my contention that a large percentage of the scholarly writing on film music is less than successful, because of the inability of these two disciplines to relate to each other theoretically. Therefore, it is the intention of this thesis to construct a methodological bridge which will allow music theory and film theory to relate to each other on a common analytical plane. I am primarily concerned with just how the film score functions once it enters into the mise-en-scène and is able to exist on an equal theoretical plane with the other elements of the filmic universe. In order to facilitate this, I will apply philosophical concepts drawn from the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze to the analysis of six individual film/score(s): L’Atalante (Jean Vigo, 1934), Things to Come (William Cameron Menzies, 1936), Scott of the Antarctic (Charles Frend, 1948), East of Eden (Elia Kazan, 1955), Hamlet (Grigori Kozintsev, 1964) and Blue (Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1993). Each of these scores provides a specific theoretical challenge which can not be overcome through the use of traditional analytical methodologies. By adapting specific Deleuzian philosophical concepts (sensation, nomadology, the refrain, the eternal refrain, becoming, utopia, smooth space, and duration) to the individual scores in question I will demonstrate that it is possible to create a flexible analytical methodology which draws the various elements of the film into a deep relationship with the score, thereby revealing the score’s actual function in each instance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Redner, Gregg","Hayward, Susan"],"dc:date":"2008-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

What narrative strategies do authors employ in order to negotiate the ethical and epistemological problems raised by this gap in time and experience?\n\n“Trauma theory” is undermined by clinical controversies and contradictory claims for “literal truth” and “incomprehensibility”.  Similarly, the Holocaust has been considered inherently unrepresentable unless by those who witnessed it, leading to a false opposition between genres of “testimony” and “fiction”.  A way out of these dead ends is to consider the role of the first-person narrator in contemporary Holocaust narratives.  While use of this device risks an inappropriate level of identification with those whose experience is both extreme and unknowable, I argue that this problem may be resolved to an extent through “transgenerational empathy”, an approach to the past that is self-reflexive, incorporates ideas of time, memory and generations, and moves both towards and away from the victims of the past in a simultaneous gesture of proximity and distance.  For this theory I draw on Dominick LaCapra’s definitions of empathy and “empathic unsettlement”, and on Hans-Georg Gadamer’s concept of the “fusion of horizons” between past and present.  \n\nTransgenerational empathy involves giving equal weight to “memory” and “history”.  An over-emphasis on memory leads to narratives that are merely identificatory, such as Anne Michaels’ Fugitive Pieces and Binjamin Wilkomirski’s Fragments.  In contrast, W. G. Sebald’s use of a narrative persona in The Emigrants and Austerlitz enables transgenerational empathy in narrative by simultaneously imposing layers of distance while establishing close personal connection.  Similarly, Jonathan Safran Foer’s third-generation aesthetic of “post-postmemory” in Everything is Illuminated uses a “dual persona” device to foreground empathically the abyss at the heart of any attempt to recapture the past.  My analysis of these authors draws on the writings of Gillian Rose, Paul Ricoeur, Marianne Hirsch and Jacques Derrida.  However, the concept of “transgenerational empathy” would benefit from further research, both in terms of its “temporal dimension” and the use of narrative personae by other contemporary authors such as Philip Roth.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ward, Lewis Henry","Fothergill, Anthony"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Previous characterisation of this enzyme has shown that it is a heterotrimeric molybdo-enzyme (SerABC) of the dimethylsulfoxide reductase family, containing a Mo-bis molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide co-factor, Fe-S clusters and a b-type haem (Schroder et al., 1997, J Biol Chem, 272: 23765-68, Dridge et al., 2007, Biochem J, 408: 19-28). In order to elucidate the electron transport pathway to selenate reductase, and how it can generate a proton motive force, detailed study was required. Firstly, the redox potential of the b-haem of SerC was determined by optical redox titration to be +234 mV. The serC gene was cloned and expressed heterologously in E. coli, but the protein was incorrectly folded into inclusion bodies, and attempts to refold and reconstitute SerC with haem were unsuccessful. A profile of c-type cytochromes in T. selenatis was undertaken, and characterisation of a number of cytochromes was carried out. Two cytochromes were purified, cytc7 and cytc4, and cytc4 was shown to be able to donate electrons to SerABC in vitro. Protein sequence was obtained by N-terminal sequencing and LC-MS/MS, and assigned cytc4 to the cytochrome c4 family of dihaem cytochromes. Redox potentiometry combined with UV-visible and electron paramagnetic spectroscopy showed that cytc4 is a dihaem cytochrome with a redox potential of +282 mV and both haems are predicted to have His-Met ligation. To investigate the role of membrane bound cytochromes in selenate respiration, PCR with degenerate primers amplified a partial gene coding for quinol: cytochrome c oxidoreductase (QCR). A microplate growth method was developed to monitor growth of T. selenatis under reproducible conditions, and used to analyse the effect of respiratory chain inhibitors on growth under different conditions. Aerobic metabolism was unaffected by QCR inhibitors, while nitrite reduction was totally inhibited, linking nitrite reduction to the generation of a proton motive force by the QCR. The QCR inhibitor myxothiazol partially inhibited selenate respiration, showing that some electron flux is via the QCR, but total inhibition of selenate respiration was achieved by combining myxothiazol with the more general inhibitor 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO). These data suggest that electron transfer to selenate reductase occurs via a branched pathway, in which one route is inhibited by myxothiazol and the other by HQNO. Electron transfer via a QCR and a dihaem cytochrome c4 is a novel route for a member of the dimethylsulfoxide reductase family of molybdo-enzymes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lowe, Elisabeth Clare","Butler, Clive S"],"dc:date":"2008-07-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A subsidiary cohort, that of the 129 lieutenants who were, like Burnett, first commissioned in 1744 is used as a control against which to measure the statistical worth of the smaller cohort. Examination of the day to day concerns of the captains has been made possible through the rich and varied resource of their letters to the Admiralty, which have hitherto been little used as a source by historians. Despite the formality of these letters not merely the concerns but also the personalities and characters of the writers are vividly conveyed.\nAfter tracing the career of Thomas Burnett this thesis examines the 1757 cohort and its progression to the rank of master and commander. At this point the correspondence with the Admiralty begins. The influences, \u0027interest\u0027 and formative experiences behind their appointments are considered. The duties of the mid-eighteenth century captain are outlined, as their relationship with the Admiralty is analysed and the extent to which they were kept under strict Admiralty control by precedent and financial scrutiny is demonstrated. All aspects of manning are shown to dominate the daily concerns of captains. The extent to which \u0027interest\u0027 or chance gave them the opportunity to display their professional expertise and increase their standing within the active naval corps is weighed. Tracking this cohort beyond the war into the years of peace and subsequent wars has revealed the extent to which the timing of being made post captain was crucial and that \u0027interest\u0027 was more significant than merit in accelerating and promoting active careers.","bibo:AuthorList":["McLeod, Anne Byrne","Duffy, Michael"],"dc:date":"2010-10-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316355,"sim:weight":0.241848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316069,"sim:weight":0.234795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":388777,"sim:weight":0.156891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447795,"sim:weight":0.134913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The law applies two distinct methods of assessing mens rea – subjectivism and objectivism – which are based on conflicting principles of criminal liability. A subjective test depends upon what the defendant himself foresaw, believed or intended whereas an objective test will label the defendant culpable for what a hypothetical ‘reasonable person’ would have foreseen or how he would have reacted. This thesis will show that, if the law is ever to take a consistent approach to assessing mens rea, both subjectivism and objectivism must be cast aside. As they place undue importance on foresight of the consequences, neither of these doctrines are capable of providing an accurate reflection of an individual’s moral culpability. Subjectivism is too narrow because it ignores any other states of mind that, although inconsistent with subjective foresight, may be considered to display a high degree of moral culpability. Objectivism is too broad because, by labelling all who fall below the reasonable standard as culpable, it takes no account of those individuals who lack the capacity to foresee what the reasonable person would have foreseen.\nIt will be shown that an approach based on the defendant’s attitudes and reasons for acting will allow for a much more accurate inference of an individual’s moral culpability than is achieved by either subjectivism or objectivism. Accordingly, this new approach is one that could be applied across the scope of the criminal law without the need for any special exceptions or illogical deviations from the norm. As a result, the way in which the English and Welsh criminal law assesses mens rea would achieve a consistency that it currently lacks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Furey, Jason Richard","McEwan, Jenny"],"dc:date":"2010-08-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The analysis examined how some pupils acquired the label ‘disaffected’ and considered the extent to which dominant curriculum ideologies and power relations between teachers and pupils contributed to pupils’ disconnection from learning.  Additionally, the study examined the effectiveness of the Alternative Education project organised by the school in a bid to engage disaffected pupils in learning.\n\nThe corpus of data was generated through a combination of semi-structured one to one interviews and a focus group interview.  Drawing on Fairclough’s (1989, 2001, 2003) approach to Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), excerpts from the data were chosen on the basis of their salience to the key themes of the study to describe, interpret and explain the opaque and contradictory discourse of disaffection. \n\nThe teachers’ narratives largely located explanations for pupils’ disconnection from learning in pupils’ cognitive, emotional and behavioural pathologies or the influence of a moral underclass culture in their communities.  The pupils’ counter-narratives suggested that their disengagement was a rational response to a perception of de-motivating curricula and disrespectful teachers, resulting in a counter school culture, where resistance accorded status among peers and compliance with teachers’ demands for conformity earned the derisory label ‘Neek’. \n\nThe teacher’s narrative also revealed that curriculum overload and the preoccupation with attainment targets posed significant challenges in his attempts to engage disaffected learners.  However, the success of the Alternative Education Programme highlighted the importance of flexibility and positive educator-pupil relationships in capturing and sustaining the interest of learners. \n\nIt is argued that an adequate analysis of the determinants of disaffection ought to consider the impact of instrumentality in education on relationships in the situational, institutional and societal contexts of schooling.  Furthermore, the significance of class, ethnicity and gender on the academic under-achievement of black working class boys, can not be overstated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moustakim, Mohamed","Hunt, Cheryl","Burden, Robert"],"dc:date":"2010-07-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In order to set priority targets for biodiversity conservation in any region of the world, it is necessary to have good, long term, scientific, biological data. Without detailed information on local floras and faunas, it is impossible to prepare detailed management plans for biodiversity conservation within the area. The conservation importance of an area, which can be determined by assessing its biodiversity, by considering its species richness and abundance of key species (indicator groups). Therefore, during this thesis we attempted to clarify processes that influence the invertebrate fauna of Cyprus in different ecosystems. We also sought to investigate the population dynamics, abundance, species richness and the diversity of different invertebrate groups. We not only described the local invertebrate fauna, but also analysed impacts of different management regimes on them. In addition to this, we used different group of invertebrates as indicators in order to identify the biologically valuable habitats for biodiversity conservation in Cyprus.\nFirstly, field surveys were carried out over a two year period for the determination of thrips fauna (Thysanoptera) in the northern part of Cyprus. During the surveys 2029 specimens were collected. We recorded 43 thrips species belonging to 23 genera. Five genera and 14 species were new records for the island of Cyprus. Also we studied the population of the thrips pests and resulting damage to fruits on different nectarine varieties in north Cyprus during 2004 and 2005. We found 21 different thrips species, most of them encountered during the petal-fall period of nectarine trees. The “Maravilla” variety (early nectarine variety) had the highest rate of non-marketable fruit during 2004-2005. \nSecondly, we determined the impacts of different management regimes on invertebrate fauna and diversity in Cypriot olive groves. We selected high and low altitude olive groves with no management, tillage only, or tillage – pesticide – fertilizer application. During this study, 12,387 arthropods were recorded and identified from 18 different orders or higher taxa. Our results showed that pesticide application on olive tree canopies significantly reduces the abundance and diversity of arthropods. We also determined the impacts of management regimes on woodlouse fauna. We found significant reductions in woodlouse abundance with tillage combined with pesticide and fertilizer application.\nThirdly, we used butterflies as an indicator group to identify the importance of forest and garrigue habitats for biodiversity conservation in Cyprus. Transect counts were used to assess the abundance and diversity of butterflies in old and young forests. We observed a significant effect of forest type on the abundance of butterflies. The number of butterflies and the number of endemic species was also higher in old forests than young forests. Also we used butterflies to evaluate the conservation value of grassland and shrubland mosaics within garrigue ecosystems in Cyprus. Habitat type showed a highly significant effect on butterfly abundance, this was particularly the case with endemics. Greater abundance was observed during early and the late season in grassland habitats. \nThe results underline the potential conservation significance of agricultural ecosystems and should serve to promote ecologically sustainable agricultural production systems in Cyprus. Also as a result of this thesis, identification and protection of grassland-shrubland mosaics in garrigue ecosystems and old mature forests along Kyrenia Range Mountains should be considered priorities in future conservation programmes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Özden, Özge","Hodgson, David"],"dc:date":"2009-01-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The research is based primarily on unique naval pay sources.  Analysis of crew compositions has not been made on this scale in the period before.\n\nThe 1667 Dutch Medway Raid is the starting point, where a few British played a leading role – amongst many others reported on the Dutch side.  Pepys and Marvell primarily blamed their joining the enemy on the lure of superior Dutch payment.  The thesis asks how many British there were really, how they came to be in Dutch service, and whether this involvement occurred, as indicated, at other times too. \n\nPart One is thematic and explores the background mechanisms of the maritime environment in detail, determining causation.  First, the two naval recruitment systems are compared and completely reassessed in the light of state intervention in the trade sphere.  Two new sets of ‘control’ data – naval wages and foreign shipping – are amongst the incentives and routes determined.  British expatriate communities are examined as conduits for the supply of naval labour and civilian support.  British personnel are compared and contrasted with other foreigners, against the background of Anglo-Dutch interlinkage and political transition from neutrality through conflict to alliance.\n\nPart Two is chronological, covering four major wars in three chapters.  Micro-case studies assembled from the scattered record streams enable analysis of the crews of particular officers and ships.  Seamen were an occupation that made them a very little known group: the thesis examines the different career types of British personnel of many different ranks, shedding light on their everyday lives.\n\nThe thesis shows that British personnel were an integral part of Dutch crews throughout the period, even when the two nations were fighting each other.  The basic need of subsistence labour for employment took precedence over allegiance to nation/ideology, demonstrating limitations in state power and the continual interdependence forced on the maritime powers through the realities of the labour market.","bibo:AuthorList":["Little, Andrew Ross","Rodger, Nicholas"],"dc:date":"2008-05-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84384,"sim:weight":0.264562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108339,"sim:weight":0.231059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.218335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108636,"sim:weight":0.204624,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108029,"sim:weight":0.202579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29418,"sim:weight":0.199376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108852,"sim:weight":0.198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108908,"sim:weight":0.102294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A simple epi detection microscope was constructed for SHG and TPF imaging in the early stages of this research. Later the imaging was transferred to a new microscope system which allowed simultaneous forwards and epi detection and combined CARS imaging with TPF and SHG.\n\nMultiphoton spectroscopic studies were conducted on both intact tissue samples and the major components of the extracellular matrix, in order to identify sources of TPF. Fluorescence was detected from type II collagen, elastin and samples of purified collagen and elastin crosslinks. Age related glycation crosslinks of collagen may be a significant source of TPF. No fluorescence was detected from proteoglycans.\n\nIn intact, unfixed healthy articular cartilage the cells were observed via CARS, surrounded in their pericellular matrix which is characterised by an increase in TPF. The collagen of the extra cellular matrix showed up clearly in the SHG images. Diseased cartilage was also imaged revealing microscopic lesion at the articular surface in early osteoarthritis and highly fibrous collagen structures and cell clusters in more advanced degeneration.\n\nIn young healthy cartilage a network of elastin fibres were found lying parallel to the articular surface in the most superficial 50μm of the tissue. Regional variations in these fibres were also investigated. The fibres appeared mainly long and straight suggesting that they may be under tension, further work is needed to identify whether they have a mechanical function.\n\nThe polarization sensitivity of the SHG from collagen has been investigated for both cartilage and tendon. In the most superficial tissue these measurements can be used directly to determine the collagen fibre orientation. However at increasing depths the effects of biattenuation and birefringence must be considered. Healthy cartilage has a characteristic pattern of polarization sensitivity with depth and this changes at lesions indicating a disruption of the normal collagen architecture.\n\nThe methods developed in this thesis demonstrate the use of non-linear microscopy to visualise the structure of the extracellular matrix and cells in intact unstained tissue. They should also be appropriate in many areas of cell and matrix biology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mansfield, Jessica Claire","Winlove, C Peter","Matcher, Steve","Moger, Julian","Knapp, Karen"],"dc:date":"2008-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The analysis of the intertextual stratification in Buzzati brings to the fore the author’s urge to convey the significance of imagination through the fantastic mode. It also reveals an optimistic and playful side of Buzzati, which lies behind a pervading pessimistic tone. Buzzati’s re-working of images from other authors and of generic topoi is aimed at decrying the loss of imagination occurring in the transition to adulthood as well as a general disregard of fantasy characterizing modern technologized societies. Nonetheless, intertextual practices are a means to recover and originally re-present the fantastic imagery conveyed by the artists from whom Buzzati drew inspiration.\nBuzzati was especially keen on Anglophone literature and art; hence, the focus of this thesis, which is divided into four chapters. Chapter One deals with Buzzati’s re-use in his fiction of drawings by the English illustrator Arthur Rackham; this is a process in which visual memory and intermedia translation are paramount. Chapter Two investigates the link between Joseph Conrad’s heroes and the characterization of Buzzati’s (anti-)heroic figures; they are trapped in the mechanisms of lack of courage and time but eventually find their own ways to self-redemption. Chapter Three considers Buzzati’s reversal and borrowing of topoi belonging to the sea monster story and the ghost story; these practices are aimed at emphasizing the importance of fantasy. Chapter Four places Buzzati’s Christmas fiction between the Italian and the Dickensian tradition, showing how Buzzati re-works the genre’s stereotypes to recreate the Christmas spirit. \nWhether Buzzati engages in an intertextual dialogue with individual authors or literary traditions, examining the connections he established with Anglophone culture allows a reassessment of his work. Indeed, the Buzzatian fantastic reveals itself as poised between gloominess and faith in the redeeming power of imagination; the fantastic alternatives Buzzati offers against the dullness of reality also evince his enjoyment of the artistic creation per se.","bibo:AuthorList":["Polcini, Valentina","Parisi, Luciano","Mangini, Angelo M."],"dc:date":"2010-07-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This is a cross-sectional test of the conditional CAPM. The models examined include simple OLS regressions, the macroeconomic variables model, the state-space model, the multivariate GARCH model and the realized beta model. The results show that the state-space model performs best in-sample with significant betas and insignificant intercepts. For the out-of-sample performance, however, none of the models examined can explain returns of the 25 portfolios.\n\nNext, I examine the recently proposed realized beta model, which is based on the realized volatility literature, by using individual stocks listed in the US market in Chapter 4. I extend the realized market beta model to betas of multi-factor asset pricing models. Models tested are the CAPM, the Fama-French three-factor model and a four-factor model including the three Fama-French factors and a momentum factor. Realized betas of different models are used in the cross-section regressions along with firm-level variables such as size, book-to-market ratio and past returns. The in-sample results show that market beta is significant and additional betas of multi-factor models can reduce although not eliminate the effects of firm-level variables. The out-of-sample results show that no betas are significant. The results are robust across different markets such as NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ. \n\nIn Chapter 5, I test if realized coskewness and cokurtosis can help explain the cross-section of stock returns. I add coskewness and cokurtosis to the factor pricing models tested in Chapter 4. The results show that the coefficients of coskewness and cokurtosis have the correct sign as predicted by the higher-moment CAPM theory but only cokurtosis is significant. Cokurtosis is significant not only in-sample but also out-of-sample, suggesting cokurtosis is an important risk. However, the effects of firm-level variables remain significant after higher moments are included, indicating a rejection of higher-moment asset pricing models. The results are also robust across different markets such as NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ.\n\nThe overall results of this thesis indicate a rejection of the conditional asset pricing models. Models of systematic risks, i.e. betas and higher comoments, cannot explain the cross-section of expected stock returns.","bibo:AuthorList":["Xu, Lei","Harris, Richard D.

The study was conducted within this framework to highlight the current problems of university entrance exams and emphasize the need for change. It also challenges the positivist view which is dominant in Japanese language testing research and expands the research area within the Japanese context.\nThe aim of the study was to empower both students and high school teachers who, as the highest stakeholders, are in a weak position and give them an opportunity to express their opinions and feelings through an open-ended questionnaire and interview. The study also intended to raise their awareness about their rights as test-takers to question the misuse of tests and encourage them to develop a critical view about the exam system.\nThe results demonstrated that university entrance examination has a negative impact on both language learning for students and high school teaching for teachers. The students experience a psychological burden while preparing for and taking the exam. Likewise, teachers feel pressured by various stakeholders including students, parents, and administrators. In addition, both students and teachers realize that entrance exams have an important influence on the life and future of a student and that they cannot be avoided in an exam-driven society.\nThe dissertation concludes with practical implications for both test-takers and testers to improve the current entrance examination system, in order to elicit positive feedback and better outcomes, as well as recommendations for further research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Takagi, Akiko","Riley, Susan"],"dc:date":"2010-03-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Through radiation hydrodynamical simulations using a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code, I find that the disc opacity plays a vital role in determining whether a disc fragments.  Specifically, opacities that are smaller than interstellar Rosseland mean values promote fragmentation (even at small radii, R \u003c 25AU) since low opacities allow a disc to cool quickly.  This may occur if a disc has a low metallicity or if grain growth has occurred.  Given that the standard core accretion model is less likely to form planets in a low metallicity environment, I predict that gravitational instability is the dominant planet formation mechanism in a low metallicity environment.  In addition, I find that the presence of stellar irradiation generally acts to inhibit fragmentation (since the discs can only cool to the temperature defined by stellar irradiation).  However, fragmentation may occur if the irradiation is sufficiently weak that it allows the disc to attain a low Toomre stability parameter.\n\nWith specific reference to the HR 8799 planetary system, I find that it is only possible for fragments to form in the radial range where the HR 8799 planets are located (approximately 24-68 AU) if the disc is massive.  In such a high mass regime, mass transport occurs in the disc causing the surface mass density to alter.  Therefore, fragmentation is not only affected by the disc temperature and cooling, but also by any restructuring due to the gravitational torques.  The high mass discs also pose a problem for the formation of this system because the protoplanets accrete from the disc and end up with masses greater than those inferred from observation and thus, the growth of planets would need to be inhibited.  In addition, I find that further subsequent fragmentation at small radii also takes place.\n\nBy way of analytical arguments in combination with hydrodynamical simulations using a parameterised cooling method, I explore the fragmentation criteria which in the past, has placed emphasis on the cooling timescale in units of the orbital timescale, beta.  I find that at a given radius the surface mass density (i.e. disc mass and profile) and star mass also play a crucial role in determining whether a disc fragments or not as well as where in the disc fragments form.  I find that for shallow surface mass density profiles (p\u003c2, where the surface mass density is proportional to R^{-p}), fragments form in the outer regions of the disc.  However for steep surface mass density profiles (p is greater than or similar to 2), fragments form in the inner regions of a disc.  In addition, I find that the critical value of the cooling timescale in units of the orbital timescale, beta_crit, found in previous simulations is only applicable to certain disc surface mass density profiles and for particular disc radii and is not a general rule for all discs.  I obtain an empirical fragmentation criteria between the cooling timescale in units of the orbital timescale, beta, the surface mass density, the star mass and the radius.  Finally, I carry out crucial resolution testing by performing the highest resolution disc simulations to date.  My results cast some serious doubts on previous conclusions concerning fragmentation of self-gravitating discs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Meru, Farzana Karim","Bate, Matthew R","Naylor, Tim"],"dc:date":"2010-09-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Ironically, they are sometimes characterised by stakeholders in destinations in less developed countries as neo-colonial invaders. In spite of their anti-tourist attitudes, in reality, backpacker tourists tend to stay in backpacker enclaves where the cultural and moral values of backpackers are dominant. This happens because they encounter many obstacles to enjoying the backpacking experience in an unfamiliar interregional (intercultural) environment. Given such contradictory phenomena surrounding backpacker tourists in less developed countries, one question is how they manifest their responsible behaviour. Therefore, this research aims to explore the nature and degree of responsible behaviour amongst backpacker tourists in Thailand, which is one of the most popular backpacker destinations in the world. Through mixed method research, this principally explores (1) the frequency levels of backpackers’ behavioural intentions, their actual responsible behaviour, and the gap between them based on a series of items representing responsible behaviour, and (2) their definitions and perceived experiences of responsible behaviour. \n\nThe research found that whilst backpacker tourists tend to report their frequent responsible behaviour and perceive themselves as “responsible” tourists, in reality, they experience many difficulties in behaving responsibly in an unfamiliar interregional (intercultural) tourism setting in spite of their intention to do so, and while being well aware of the importance of behaving responsibly. There is a propensity among backpacker tourists to exaggerate the importance of small and fleeting experiences of responsible behaviour outside backpacker enclaves (e.g. a moment of demonstrating a respectful attitude towards local people). Also, cultural experiences within backpacker enclaves, which are staged authentic manner (e.g. participation in a cultural or cookery class), tend to be exaggerated in importance and regarded as highly responsible behaviour. Moreover, whilst backpacker tourists appreciate themselves as “responsible” tourists and during their travels they respect others and behave so as not to disturb others which are required to do so regardless of place, culture and custom even in the home in daily life, they represented their reluctance to “engage” in responsible behaviour, especially altruistic and philanthropic activities (i.e., engagement in volunteering work or donating to local communities). These propensities were common to all types of backpacker tourists in this study; even those who reported their own outstandingly frequent intention and actual responsible behaviour (i.e., backpacker tourists who travel extensively with the strong motivation to explore destination countries). The principal conclusion in this research is that, whilst the behaviour reported by the backpacker tourists was never harmfully irresponsible, there are several contradictions between their evaluation of their responsible behaviour and their actual behaviour patterns. Moreover, there is a gap between their behavioural pattern of responsible behaviour and the concept of “responsible tourism” for backpacker tourists.

It proposes and supports the existence of a burgeoning transnational Dominican performance paradigm in both New York City, home to the largest Dominican diaspora, and the homeland of the Dominican Republic. \n\tTo do this effectively, the thesis has been divided into three parts, each containing three chapters. Part 1 serves largely as a review of published literature in the fields of study relevant to the topic.  For example, Chapter 1 serves as an introduction to the essential characteristics of the processes of globalization and transnational migration and of the US Latino identity formations that historically have developed as a result of these processes. Chapter 2 broadly examines the varied practices that constitute the transnational performance genre while Chapter 3 specifically defines the socio-economic experience of US Latinos and the early formulations of US Latino transnational performance that developed as a result.  \n\tIn Part 2, the concepts of globalization and transnationalism are placed into a purely Dominican context. In Chapter 4 the socio-economic relationship between the United States and the Dominican Republic is examined while Chapter 5 addesses the cultural and racial identity issues Dominicans face in both the homeland and the New York diaspora as a result of the complex interconnections between these two locations. Chapter 6 then offers a history of the development of Dominican theatre in New York City while Chapter 7 provides an analysis of the lives and work of three Dominican theatre and performance artists living in the New York diaspora who are generating a transnational performance aesthetic as a result of negotiating the socio-cultural and economic divide that separates their residence in New York from their homeland, the Dominican Republic.  \n\tPart 3 emphasizes the reciprocity of transnational performance. For example, Chapter 8 provides the argument that historically throughout the twentieth-century, theatre practices occurring in the Dominican Republic were consistently being influenced by North American theatre traditions. Chapter 9 offers an examination of the work of three specific Dominican theatre and performance artists who have been shaped by the process of “Americanization” and who, in their own unique way, are currently responding to this process in their work, providing credence to the theory that transational performance can be cultivated also in the homeland by those who have never actually migrated.  The conclusion to the thesis is a reflection on the universalities of transnational Dominican performance so to use that which is taking place in New York City and the Dominican Republic as a tool for comparison in the broader study of the growing tradition of transnational performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hundley, James Douglas","Ley, Graham"],"dc:date":"2008-05-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, the increased areal storage densities of hard disk drives require a level of miniturisation of the recording heads where the micromagnetic details and switching mechanisms can no longer be ignored. Furthermore, theoretical and numerical studies on thin-film recording heads tend to separate the micromagnetics from the electromagnetic aspects of the head during switching and hence ignore the lossy nature of head materials. This project was aimed to develop a numerical simulation approach that simultaneously incorporates the fundamental micromagnetic and electromagnetic details of magnetic materials to study the fast switching process in soft magnetic materials in general, and in thin-film inductive writers in particular. The project also was aimed at establishing an impedance measurement system to characterise losses in magnetic recording heads, and to allow comparison with the simulations. This project successfully met all its original objectives. A numerical technique to simulate the dynamic behaviour of magnetic materials and devices has been developed, and applied to study the switching process in thin-film recording heads. Two-dimensional simulations of complete commercial head structures including the coils and pole regions were carried out and parameters such as gap field rise times, gap field distributions, and core inductances, which are important for head designers, were predicted. Moreover, the role of eddy currents delaying the magnetisation switching was elucidated. Furthermore, it was found that the gradient of the recording fields were sharper near the conrner regions of the poles when considering magnetic details. A high precision, high bandwidth impedance measurement system was established to characterise losses in magnetic heads. Fittings of measured core inductances to a proposed equivalent circuit model of the core’s relaxation processes revealed the switching times of heads (of the order 0.1 to 1.0ns).","bibo:AuthorList":["Recio, Gustavo","Aziz, Mustafa M."],"dc:date":"2008-07-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":2736027,"ep:Repository":45,"dc:type":["Thesis or dissertation","Doctoral","PhD","PhD in Finance"],"bibo:shortTitle":"High Frequency and Large Dimension Volatility","bibo:abstract":"Three main issues are explored in this thesis—volatility measurement, volatility spillover and large-dimension covariance matrices. For the first question of volatility measurement, this thesis compares two newly-proposed, high-frequency volatility measurement models, namely realized volatility and realized range-based volatility. It does so in the aim of trying to use empirical results to assess whether one volatility model is better than the other. The realized volatility model and realized range-based volatility model are compared based on three markets, five forecast models, two data frequencies and two volatility proxies, making sixty scenarios in total. Seven different loss functions are also used for the evaluation tests. This necessarily ensures that the empirical results are highly robust. After making some simple adjustments to the original realized range-based volatility, this thesis concludes that it is clear that the scaled realized range-based volatility model outperforms the realized volatility model. \n\nFor the second research question on volatility spillover, realized range-based volatility and realized volatility models are employed to study the volatility spillover among the S\u0026P 500 index markets, with the aim of finding out empirically whether volatility spillover exists between the markets. Volatility spillover is divided into the two categories of statistically significant volatility spillover and economically significant volatility spillover. Economically significant spillover is defined as spillover that can help forecast the volatility of another market, and is therefore a more powerful measurement than statistically significant spillover. The findings show that, in reality, the existence of volatility spillover depends on the choice of model, choice of volatility proxy and value of parameters used.\nThe third and final research question in this thesis involves the comparison of various large-dimension multivariate models. The main contribution made by this specific study is threefold. First, a number of good performance multivariate volatility models are introduced by adjusting some commonly used models. Second, different models and various choices of parameters for these models are tested based on 26 currency pairs. Third, the evaluation criteria adopted possess much more practical implications than those used in most other papers on this subject area.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shi, Zhangbo","Harris, Richard D.

Alongside the positive effects of the wide-spread usage of English there are negative tendencies which emerge onto the scene. This thesis is concerned with the educational aspects of such influences where it explored trainee teachers’ conceptualisations of English as an international / global language, and examined the implications of current views of English for teacher preparation in light of the most recent methodological trends such as global English delivery, expansion of teacher knowledge base, the introduction of linguistic rights and instructional policies to educational stakeholders, and the merging of language and culture in English language teaching. Through questionnaires and in-depth interviews the study found that the relationship between the local and global in Kuwait is a complex issue with social, educational and political implications. Multiple functions for English and its status within the local context were voiced and consequently alternative futures for Standard Arabic as the main source and medium of local literacy and language of academia against the background of rapid Anglicisation emerged. The results may attract the attention of Kuwait’s educational theorists and practitioners, and the hopeful outcome would be to inspire teachers to engage in critical thinking and challenge their realities; and encourage Kuwait’s educational policy makers to find a balance between the source and target languages/cultures, as well as bring to the foreground local expertise and knowledge.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Rubaie, Reem","Troudi, Salah"],"dc:date":"2010-09-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

As frontline workers, school staff hold a role in identifying and supporting pupils at a universal level.  How staff view the issue of loss and their role in supporting this is therefore pivotal.   A survey design using two devised online questionnaires and semi-structured interviews identifies the experiences and perceptions of school based staff on the issue of loss for schools in one local authority.  Using interactive analysis, qualitative and quantitative data from senior leaders in 20 schools, 25 additional school staff members and 9 multi-agency professionals is triangulated to determine perceptions.\nA range of effects across social, emotional, behaviour and learning are well recognised by staff although behaviour is used as the most frequent indicator of those at longer term ‘risk’.  A more structured and rigorous school response exists for loss through death compared to family breakdown despite some specific staff concerns for pupils experiencing loss through multiple changes in the family.  Whilst staff members indicate a high expectation to support pupils with loss, they report lower confidence in doing so.  A series of influencing factors on staff perceptions are identified at a contextual, situational and individual level.  Factors that could be targeted by Educational Psychology Service to help schools build capacity are highlighted, with future considerations for support with identification, training and supervision. Abstract: Phase Two\nThis second phase of a two part research design investigates how an Educational Psychology Service can increase the capacity of schools to support pupils who have experienced loss.  Following a survey design identifying staff attitudes on the issue of loss for schools, a multi-method case study approach is used to research the implementation of a 6-week ‘Loss and Change’ intervention programme.  Seven secondary age students participated in the group intervention for pupils who have experienced loss, facilitated by two Educational Psychologists working alongside a member of school staff.  A grounded theory approach analysed data from observation, semi-structured interviews and self-report measures.   Eight key processes that impact on the effectiveness of the programme are identified and the positive effects spanning social, emotional and behavioural mechanisms are reported for six of the participants.    Potential implications of this model of practice for Educational Psychology Services seeking to develop the capacity of schools to support loss are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thomas, Wendy Anne","Norwich, Brahm"],"dc:date":"2010-05-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Greater combinations of sounds expressing a wider spectrum of tones, textures and volumes can be heard at the movies more than ever before, while behind the scenes, the number of personnel producing them has grown considerably. Moreover, this era has witnessed a proliferation of different artistic and professional approaches to sound. This thesis provides a detailed and wide-ranging picture of these developments and how they were ultimately affected by changes within the American film industry. Drawing on a range of accounts by contemporary sound practitioners and critics, the thesis explores sound production practices, focusing on the sound designer and composer, their creative choices, collaborative relationships - or “sound relations” - and the technologies they employ. The soundtrack is also examined in terms of “sonic style”: the ways in which sound effects, music and the voice function variously in the service of contemporary film narration and genre. It is argued that Hollywood sound production practices and styles have diversified to a high degree, particularly during the last three decades. Industrial realignments on the “New Hollywood” landscape in the 1970s and the integration of the independent and major sectors throughout the 1990s have introduced greater flexibility to mainstream filmmaking norms. These events have played key roles in the expansion of its different sonic styles and working practices in contemporary Hollywood. I take George Lucas and David Lynch, their respective sound design partners Ben Burtt and Alan Splet and composers John Williams and Angelo Badalamenti, and identify distinctions between their professional modus operandi and sonic styles to illustrate the growing diversification within the industry. Most importantly, these examples are used to demonstrate both the intricacy and variety that characterises the styles and crafts of the contemporary Hollywood soundtrack.","bibo:AuthorList":["McGill, Amy","Hanson, Helen"],"dc:date":"2008-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Chapter one contains a brief introduction into previous work by the Dobbs group, involving the optimisation of the silyl-Prins reaction and aza-silyl-Prins reaction, which afford substituted dihydropyrans and tetrahydropyridines respectively.\n\nChapter two initially provides a literature overview towards the synthesis of piperidines using this methodology. Following this, our results demonstrate that using different substitution patterns in the homoallylic amine precursors has quite a significant regiochemical effect on the reaction. These effects include the formation of pyrrolidine structures, which can be isolated and characterised. \n\nChapter three presents the utilization of the previously optimised silyl-Prins and aza-silyl-Prins reaction to obtain oxa- and aza-cycles containing a trifluoromethyl group, a functionality known to have significant effects on the lipophilicity of drug molecules. Next in chapter four, again the advantages of using the aza-silyl-Prins reaction to obtain high functionality in a simple coupling reaction are presented, with the formation of pipecolate and pipecolic acid analogues. Chapter five includes attempts to use the aza-silyl-Prins to form tetrasubstituted tetrahydropyridines using precedent from studies in the silyl-Prins reaction. However, although the similarities between these two coupling reactions are obvious, the differences in heteroatom in the substrates and products have a significant effect. Following previous attempts in the group to form nitrogen heterocycles in high enantiopurity with little success, chapter six discusses the optimisation of a new Lewis acid mediated imine-vinylsilane cyclisation reaction. The formation of 2-substituted free amine tetrahydropyridines was successful for racemic examples, but the studies into utilising this methodology towards an asymmetric synthesis are yet to be finalised. Finally, chapter seven investigates the use of the aza-silyl-Prins reaction into forming more complex natural products such as cannabisativine.\n\nPart of this work has been published in: \n1)\tA.P.Dobbs, R.J.Parker, J.Skidmore, Tetrahedron Letters, 2008, 49, 827-831.","bibo:AuthorList":["Parker, Robert James","Dobbs, Adrian"],"dc:date":"2008-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Dickens passionately believed that the Church was failing in its Christian responsibility to the poor. Contrary to contemporary religious thought, he neither accepted that the appalling depravation endured by the poor esulted from their personal sin, or that the imperative of spiritual redemption negated the Church\u0027s responsibility to ease their physical distress. He also realised that among his predominately London-based middle-class readership there was genuine ignorance of the reality of the suffering endured by the poor.                                          In his early fiction Dickens used a two stage approach to communicate his personal beliefs about the poor. The first, adopted in \u0027Our Parish\u0027 and the first seven chapters of Oliver Twist, involved the graphic description of the suffering endured by the poor and the exposure of the inadequacies of the parochial system upon which they depended. Next, Dickens introduces his readers to a series of characters who embody his perception of Christian charity. Mr Pickwick, Mr brownlow and Charles Cheeryble (collectively referred to in this thesis as \u0027Charitable Angels\u0027)are, contrary to  parochial officials and those who participate in charitable activity for their own selfish ends, shown to make a difference in the lives of those they assist.

The context, achievements and failures of the Admiralty’s hydrographic function, including surveying, chart production, supply, sales and its contribution to the Navy and the scientific world, as an all encompassing beast has been overlooked; the Admiralty placed the responsibility for those tasks on the shoulders of its Hydrographer. Subsequently he determined the success or failure of the office, using his initiative to expand and develop opportunities benefiting the Admiralty, as well as managing a valuable resource of geographical intelligence, fostering links with scientists and the international hydrographic community. The Hydrographer also found himself creating his own policies, serving as Secretary to the Board of Longitude, being a consultant on navigational matters, taking responsibility for the acquisition, supply and maintenance of chronometers for the Navy, as well as being a focal point for issues concerning pay, promotion and manning for surveying specialists. The period from 1808 to 1829 saw many changes, which gave rise to numerous opportunities for expansion. The Admiralty Board and William, Duke of Clarence (as the last Lord High Admiral), both had a direct influence in the way the office expanded, which saw innovation and experimental work become part of the Hydrographer’s routine, especially after the Peace of 1815. But expansion required funding and at a time when internal economy appeared to the be the main objective within the Admiralty, Captain Thomas Hurd managed not only to establish a 100% increase in surveying capacity but laid the foundation for a distinct specialist and professional core of survey officers. His successor, Captain William Parry, despite his absences, overhauled working practices in the office, set standards for surveyors to follow and continued to expand the number of survey ships in commission. Subsequently Captain Francis Beaufort was left the most highly efficient hydrographic office since its foundation in 1795.","bibo:AuthorList":["Webb, Adrian James","Duffy, Dr Michael"],"dc:date":"2010-06-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This study explores the attitudes and reasoning of eleven young people who have been exposed to domestic abuse and are displaying perpetrator behaviours. Results reveal a complex interaction between experiences and skill deficits at a crucial time of identity formation, resulting in the formation and maintenance of destructive attitudes and contradictory reasoning about abusive behaviour. The direct implications of this study, suggestions for further research, and for Educational Psychology Services are discussed.\nPaper two: An evaluation of an intervention for adolescents who have been exposed to domestic abuse and are displaying perpetrator behaviours\nWhere domestic violence occurs, children and young people are likely to have been exposed to such abuse. Evidence suggests that this is likely to have a detrimental impact on them. There is an acute gap in provision for such individuals, despite evidence suggesting a link between exposure to domestic abuse in childhood, and involvement in abusive dating relationships in late adolescence and adulthood.

Modern friction formulations have been developed around asbestos fibres, a heavily used material before legislation outlawed its use in the 1980’s.\nThe replacement adopted by the friction industry was aramid, a high performance, high cost synthetic fibre.\nThe work in this thesis investigates the role of aramid fibres in an economy friction\nmaterial from the early mixing stages in manufacture using mechanical and optical analysis techniques through to the friction and wear performance of brake pads by employing instrumented friction and wear machines. Experimental procedures were designed and employed to quantify the performance of aramid pulp within the friction formulation as a function of volume fraction. Investigation showed a hierarchal fibre structure produced by an inherent molecular structure that encourages fibrillation producing complex fibre\nmorphologies. This physical structure has been identified as fundamental to the success of aramid pulp in friction materials as the fibre network readily entraps small particles aiding the manufacturing process of friction materials. A structural model has been developed to describe both the particle retention performance of aramid fibres and the bulk structure of the pulp as a function of fibre geometry.\nA dynamic mechanical test was used to measure the bulk elastic properties of fibre\nnetworks to assess their suitability as processing fibres in friction materials and providing a novel analytical technique for the friction industry.\nHemp, flax and jute are examples of high performance natural fibres that offer a significant cost saving over aramid, representing candidate replacements. Various natural fibres were trialled in friction formulations as direct replacements and also blended with aramid pulp.\nThe results are compared to the baseline specification produced for aramid pulp allowing the suitability of natural fibres in friction materials to be discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sloan, Michael Sloan","Evans, Ken E","Hooper, Bill"],"dc:date":"2008-08-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Explanations of organismal form are frequently given in terms of a force or essence that exists prior to the organism’s life in the world.  Traits of organisms are products of the selective environment and the unbroken linear inheritance of genetically coded developmental programs.  Homological traits share unbroken vertical inheritance from a single common ancestor.  Species are the product of exclusive gene flow between conspecifics and vertical genetic inheritance.  And likewise, race is ascribed on the basis of pre-existing essential features.  \n\tIn place of this underlying preformationism which locates the source of form either in the informational program of inherited genes or within a selecting environment, I suggest form is the product of an organism’s self-construction using diverse resources.  This can be understood as a modification of Kant’s view of organisms as self-organizing, set out in his Critique of Judgment (1790).  Recast from this perspective the meaning and reference of “trait,” “homology,” “species,” and “race” change.  \n\tFirstly, a trait may be the product of the organism’s self-construction utilizing multiple ancestral resources.  Given this, homologous traits may correspond in some but not all of their features or may share some but not all of their ancestral sources.  Homology may be partial.  Species may acquire epigenetic, cellular, behavioural, and ecological resources both vertically and horizontally.  As such, they are best conceived of as recurrent successions of self-constructed and reconstructed life cycles of organisms sharing similar resources, a similar habitus, similar capacities for sustaining themselves, and repeated generative processes.  Lastly, race identity is not preformed but within the control of human organisms as agents who self-construct, interpret, and ascribe their own race identities utilizing diverse sets of dynamic relationships, lived experiences, and histories.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kendig, Catherine Elizabeth","Moss, Lenny"],"dc:date":"2008-10-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Measures of identity, well-being and cognition were taken before and after participants took part in six weekly sessions of either group reminiscence or a group control activity. A Pretest-Posttest Control design was employed to explore the difference in average change between treatment conditions. The main findings showed no difference in average change between the two groups on measures of identity and well-being. However, the reminiscence group showed a greater overall improvement in memory than the control group.

Because of this, their history has largely been marginalised - or if dealt with, only in broad three hundred year studies.  However, their importance has been largely underestimated.  With the rise in the late eighteenth century of a more coherent ‘Blue-Water Strategy’, classified later by some historians as a uniquely ‘British Way in Warfare’, there was a need to have an operational organisation from which to implement Britain’s grand strategy.  The two other contemporary military organizations (Army and Navy) were too large, had internal resistance to, or simply had one-dimensional geographic identification which prevented the full pure operational implementation of British amphibious power.  With the dawn of the Seven Years War the government gave this operational priority to the Navy, which began in earnest with the formation of the British Marine Corps.  The Navy, and Marines, were able to do this by constructing an operational doctrine and identity for its new Marine Corps.  With the forty-seven year construction of its operational doctrine and identity, the Marines not only assisted in the implementation of British grand strategy, but also were pivotal in the protection of the empire.\nThis dissertation is separated into two distinct parts.  The first part outlines the skeleton of the Marines; their past formations, administration and manpower construct.  The second part outlines the trials and tribulations of construction and institutionalisation of the Marine Corps within the British nation of the late-eighteenth century.  This part reveals the non-combat usage, operational development and imperial rapid reaction force aspects of the Marines.  Marines were to carry out many protection and security related duties on land and at sea.  Because of this they were given direct access to weapons which in the unfortunate event of mutiny might be used against the men.  Naval and amphibious combat were the main justifications for why the Marine Corps existed to begin with.  Marines were to develop their own special ‘targeted’ suppression fire and a reliance on the bayonet for both of these operations.  Importantly Empire; its maintenance, expansion, and protection was an essential element of the Marines existence.   Marines were to become an imperial rapid reaction force that could be sent anywhere a naval ship was and used to suppress disorders.  Identity was the tool of three powers (Public, Admiralty and Marine Corps) in their construction of this body of men.  Marines’ identity allowed them to be relied upon for a multitude of duties, including the basic protection of order on ship.   By understanding all of these areas not only will it expand historical scholarship on how the British state constructed and implemented its policy decisions, but also how an organisation creates and validates its own purpose of existence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zerbe, Britt Wyatt","Duffy, Michael"],"dc:date":"2010-09-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This region is often considered within the context of other ‘worlds’, particularly in the quest to understand ‘Minoanisation’. Prominent Middle Cycladic sites such as Ayia Irini (Kea), Phylakopi (Melos) and Akrotiri (Thera) have played a dominant role towards informing the perceived Cycladic ‘response’ to growing Minoan influence within the Aegean sphere, often at the expense of considering the interactions between these important settlements. However, the recent 2000-2001 pillar pit excavations at Akrotiri have allowed a whole new phasing for the MBA ceramic deposits and offer great potential for characterising these neglected interactions. The ceramic material studied here, from Phases B and C of the MBA assemblage at Akrotiri, corresponds to the introduction of imported and ‘Minoanised’ material traits, both compositional and technological, to the local ceramic repertoire. This material is contextualised within previous research in the Cyclades, including Phylakopi, Ayia Irini and Mikre Vigla.\nScale is considered an important theme and provides a key structure throughout this thesis. Three scales were defined for considering all aspects of the ceramic assemblage at Akrotiri: a) the potters at Akrotiri, the technological choices they make, the social practices they participate in and perpetuate and the character of the local ceramic production sequence (the micro-scale of individuals); b) the character and significance of the Akrotiri ceramic assemblage within the Cyclades (the meso-scale of group interaction); c) the role that Akrotiri played as a node within larger social and exchange networks throughout the Aegean (the macro-scale of community interactions).\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, four explanatory frameworks are employed to tackle and integrate these various scales: the chaîne opératoire, dynamic systems framework, network theory and communities of practice. In combination, these frameworks have the potential to bridge the structure-agency divide, by acknowledging the fundamentally social nature of artefact production and consumption, and to integrate recent considerations of human and non-human agency within dynamic processes.\nUltimately, by considering the socially constituted processes that drive the learning and practice of a craft or technique, and how these processes contribute to and perpetuate communities of practice, archaeologists can begin to meaningfully characterise the contact between different groups of people in the past. Therefore, this technological study of the late Middle Cycladic ceramic assemblage of Akrotiri, integrates macroscopic, petrographic and QEMSCAN analyses to characterise and explore the interactions within and between the many communities of practice operating within the late MBA Cyclades. In addition, this methodology allows a better understanding of the choices the communities in the Cyclades were making in the lead up to ‘Minoanisation’ so we can approach these material phenomena from a more localised, site-based perspective rather than a traditional Creto-centric viewpoint.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hilditch, Jillian Ruth","Knappett, Carl"],"dc:date":"2008-10-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The elements of success in building this relationship are explored to some extent  in the therapeutic literature, but do not necessarily cross the discipline divide to provide clear guidance for youth work practice. This paper explored the elements of success in engaging with vulnerable young people from the perspectives of eleven vulnerable young people and ten practitioners using Personal Construct Psychology methods to elicit and compare perceptions of the process of engagement. Professionals’ personal theories of the  causation and prevention of a commonly occurring case study were also investigated for their relationship to the personal constructs guiding their practice. It was found that young people prioritised the affective elements of the relationship, but that pragmatic considerations were also of high importance to them. In contrast, professionals prioritised a commitment to young person well-being, followed by factors supporting the well-being of the practitioner including self reflection. Implications for practice include an appreciation of the factors important to young people, such as genuine warmth and affect, and pragmatics that make a worker more accessible such as ad hoc availability and approachability.\n \n\nAbstract Paper 2\nVulnerable young people access services such as Youth Services and Youth Offending Services.

It is believed to be among the least common and most complex forms of animal learning. After almost a century of studying social learning in animals, scientists still have not been able to give a clear answer to the question “Do animals imitate?”.  Although there have been some studies that have shown certain species under certain conditions unequivocally imitate (e.g. Zentall, et al., 1996), these studies have not been successfully replicated in a wide range of species. This thesis expands the social learning literature extending the range of settings and species in which it has been studied and by drawing links to the field of behaviour analysis.\nFour of the current studies used versions of the two-action method to look for imitative learning in both non- human primates and domesticated animals. In this methodology an observer watches a demonstrator manipulate an apparatus with two different parts of their body. Using two different parts of the body and not two different manipulations lets researchers determine if the individual is learning by observation or just learning about changes in the state of the environment. This methodology is the only one that can distinguish local enhancement (learning only to attend to the location of the demonstrator), or stimulus enhancement (learning only to attend to the stimulus which the demonstrator interacts with) from “true” imitation (Campbell, Heyes, and Goldsmith, 1999).  \nOne of the current studies used the “do as I do” methodology. In this method a subject is trained to match a few gestures of the demonstrator for reinforcement (i.e. the demonstrator raises her/his hand and the subject raises his/her hand) on the verbal command of “Do this” or “Do it”. After the subject reaches criterion on the trained behaviours a novel behaviour is added that has not been trained to see if the subject will spontaneously imitate the behaviour. Successfully copying a novel demonstration is taken as evidence of understanding the rule needed for imitative performance. This methodology is popular because it not only can distinguish between imitation and the other forms of social learning, but it can also show the subjects’ ability to generalize this type of learning.\nThe overall results show very little imitative learning occurring in the various groups of animals studied.  The low rate of imitation may not be surprising. For just over 100 years psychologists have been studying social learning and in that time only a handful of researchers have been able to show clear evidence of an animal’s ability to imitate the actions of a demonstrator. These results suggest that, though imitative learning may be important in the lives of a few species, or in the acquisition of particular behaviour, it is unlikely that it plays an essential role in the acquisition of behaviour in general, especially behaviour through which animals directly manipulate their environment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dorey, Nicole","Lea, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2008-07-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A\nprinciple aim of the cross-sector partnerships was to enhance learning opportunities, integral to which was the incorporation of ICT. The study explores through interweaving narratives, some of the key interrelationships that emerged from the evolving partnerships as they strived to accomplish their aims.\nThe partnerships represented a rich and complex context for dynamic and strategic change occurring, not only in the evolving partnerships, but also in the systems they intended to consolidate and optimise.\nFurthermore, such complexity pervaded ideological notions of instability and discontinuity arising from difference that may be implicit or explicit in open, distributed complex systems.\nThe metaphor of hypertext serves to both retain textural qualities of organisation and address key problematics associated with visualisation and representation and also as a means to reflect upon the study by encouraging improvisatory processes akin to those experienced by the participants. In this respect, hypertext is not used to simply challenge artificial boundaries, linearities and determinisms but rather, prompt the construction of meanings further to those partially represented.

The related literature indicates that this was a contentious issue. The aim of the current study is to explore the relationship between the role of the EP and professional background using an interpretive methodology. Twelve participants were interviewed using a semi-structured interview format. The participants were four EPs, four primary Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators (SENCos), three secondary SENCos and a Portage Worker. The aim of the study is also to establish what skills and qualities the participants perceive to be necessary to be an effective and credible practitioner. Following analysis of the interview data, a number of themes emerged. In terms of desirable EP attributes, the participants’ responses fell into three broad categories, interpersonal skills, psychological skills and other qualities. The participants perceived the EP role as either expert or collaborative, although some expressed a degree of uncertainty about the nature of the role. All of the participants alluded to a link between experience and credibility, although the nature of desirable experience varied between personal and professional experience. Participants who viewed the role of the EP within an expert model favoured teaching experience over other forms of pre-training experience. The second stage of this study is set in the context of the recent changes to the initial training of Educational Psychologists (EPs). The broad aim of the study is to explore beliefs that are held in relation to the relationship between the role of the EP and professional background. In particular, stage two aims to explore the participants’ belief systems in greater depth. It was therefore deemed that Personal Construct Psychology (PCP) would provide an appropriate psychological framework to inform the design of the study and interpretation of the data. Six of the twelve participants who were interviewed at stage one of this study participated in follow-up interviews using a self-characterisation technique. Their responses were laddered in order to elicit superordinate constructs, until an end point was agreed upon between participant and researcher, which are referred to as ‘core constructs’. The data were clustered in relation to the themes arising from stage one, resulting in six clusters, collaboration, motivation and applying psychology being ranked as most important for EPs. The use of PCP as a theoretical framework has provided a psychological perspective from which to address beliefs regarding the professional background of EPs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nicholls, Daniel J.","Maxwell, Tim"],"dc:date":"2010-05-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":56477,"sim:weight":0.294382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108747,"sim:weight":0.290734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53596,"sim:weight":0.285371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.284729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53693,"sim:weight":0.272803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26502,"sim:weight":0.25475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.230709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.214932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57679,"sim:weight":0.209183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is a response to two problematic aspects of the historiography, whose authority has only recently begun to be questioned: first, the inordinate focus upon the polemical and problematic mid-ninth-century Cordoban hagiography and apologetic of Eulogius and Paul Albar, whose prejudiced vision has not only been accepted as a source of social history, but also projected onto all Andalusī Christianity to support the second – the assertion that conversion happened early and en masse, and led to their eradication in the early twelfth century.\nEulogius and Albar’s account of a Córdoba oppressed and Christians persecuted (a trope herein dubbed the ecclesia destituta) has dominated thinking about the indigenous Christians of al-Andalus, due to its championing by Catholic historians since the texts’ rediscovery and publication in 1574, and by nineteenth-century Spanish nationalists to whose ideological and patriotic purposes it was amenable.  The Cordobans’ account is here re-evaluated as regards its value as a historical artefact and its internal problems are outlined.  The discrepancies between the picture created by Eulogius and Albar and that of other contemporary reports, and the problematic hagiography, are then explained to some degree by the literary models Eulogius had at his disposal – of primary interest are the classical pagan poetics of Vergil, Horace and Juvenal and the late antique theology of Augustine.\nAlbar’s famous despair at the Arabisation of the Christian youth has, in conjunction with Eulogius’ ecclesia destituta and the relative scarcity of documentary evidence for the Christians of Andalusī territory, formed the crux of assumptions regarding the speed and extent of Arabisation and conversion.  In reassessing Richard Bulliet’s ‘curve of conversion’, which seemed on a faulty reading to prove these assumptions, the second part of the thesis seeks to argue that profound Arabisation did not impact until a century later than is thought and resulted not in assimilative decline but in a late cultural flowering, and show the long, and in many places unbroken, survival of indigenous Christian communities in al-Andalus to the early fifteenth century.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harrison, Alwyn Richard","Barton, Simon"],"dc:date":"2009-12-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

From the tourism literature, the concepts of the marker (MacCannell 1976), collage tourism (Rojek 1997) and the romantic gaze (Urry 1990) are considered within the motivational and information-seeking elements. Additionally, a range of literature from history, geography, sociology, Cornish studies and the emerging tenets of tourism research is utilised. Historic sources, such as guidebooks and postcards, illustrate the nature of the visitor experience in previous decades and foreground the contemporary review. The latter comprises an analysis of visitors’ books and a face-to-face survey with 725 respondents at three churches. From this data, a cross-profile of the Cornish church visitor is created, identifying multiple motivations which include a search for ‘roots’ and Celtic elective affinity, besides spiritual support and aesthetic satisfaction. Socio-demographic and socio-economic indicators segment the church visitor population although lifestyle is argued to be as significant. There is a clear distinction between the visitors and the national average across a number of practices, including television viewing and holiday-taking. A distinction also exists in terms of educational qualifications and membership of heritage organisations. Bourdieu’s (1986) concept of cultural capital acquisition is posited as an influential determinant for a number of visitors. Conflating the multiple motivations for first-time and repeat visitors, a classification of purposive, incidental, and accidental Cornish church visitors is created. A small number are frequent visitors to churches whilst, for the majority, the experience is just one element in the overall visitor experience. It is apparent that the extant Cornish church heritage forms a key attraction in the county’s destination image.","bibo:AuthorList":["Busby, Graham Donald","Williams, Allan","Shaw, Gareth"],"dc:date":"2006-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In order to understand the phenomenon of CPD from the perspective of experienced teachers in the context this study explores their perceptions about CPD; along with their choice of CPD initiatives and the reasons and factors which impact on their choice. It also explores teachers’ suggestions about improving CPD in their context. It is expected that the results of this thesis will create awareness of these aspects among experienced EFL teachers, their institutions, local CPD organisations and as well as the community of experienced expatriate tertiary teachers of EFL. It is also expected that the study will raise implications to consider for improving the CPD experience of teachers in the context.\n\nData was obtained using face to face individual and focus group interviews with volunteers who were foundation EFL teachers with a minimum of five years teaching experience in the context. Results revealed that participants in the study valued CPD as lifelong professional evolution that resulted in evident change. High preference emerged for participation in learning through participation in activities that provided opportunities for dialogue and collaboration. However, participants experienced less empowered and without a voice in the implementation of the institutional CPD agenda. Similarly disillusionment was experienced with CPD organisations’ standardized initial teacher education focused CPD.  \n\nThe study highlights how when teachers feel less empowered in their existing professional and occupational communities, they exercise their agency in finding alternative means of professional development. One result of this situation is the emergence of teacher initiated communities where learning takes place in an environment of mutual shared understandings. This also illuminates the existence of untapped expertise in the context which if exploited can benefit federal institutions; their teachers, CPD providers and subsequently others in the context. The main implication arising from this study is for federal universities, teachers and CPD providers to work in tandem and attempt to establish teacher learning communities of practice within the institution for situated learning within the context of practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jafri, Naziha Ali","Rich, Sarah","Cadorath, Jill"],"dc:date":"2009-10-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108075,"sim:weight":0.375933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.321446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84939,"sim:weight":0.288656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.285562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.267583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

As a contribution to the innovations in Saudi Higher Education, this study explores the perceptions of Saudi female lecturers and undergraduate students towards blended learning from their experience as participants in blended courses. \n\nThe advantage of blended learning was recognized by the Ministry of Saudi Higher Education as a solution to the challenge of providing college education to the rapidly growing student population. As the move to a blended learning model represents a radical shift in the Saudi educational system, this study shows how Saudi students and lecturers reacted to this change and how it affected the quality of their learning and teaching experience. \n\nThe objective of the study is to identify Saudi female undergraduate students’ and lecturers’ perceptions of the advantages, challenges and future of blended learning. Consequently, the key factors that influence the lecturers’ and students’ views are discussed, and recommendations for future research, strategy and practice are provided. Qualitative methods were used to obtain rich descriptive data to facilitate the exploration of the phenomena. Based on interpretative philosophy, the data was analysed in the form of explanation and interpretation of the participants’ perceptions of blended learning.  \n\nThe study concludes that blended learning has the potential to offer a successful learning experience in Saudi Arabia. As there are always challenges of adaptation when a new approach is employed, this research provides insight into how the challenges of implementing blended learning in Saudi Higher Education could be addressed. A theoretical blended learning framework is introduced to provide the factors that influence the implementation of blended learning. One of the major conclusions is that a blended learning environment offers Saudi females the flexibility to continue their higher education while maintaining their own cultural values and traditions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alebaikan, Reem  A.","Troudi, Salah","Robinson, Wendy"],"dc:date":"2010-09-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108925,"sim:weight":0.486162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15223,"sim:weight":0.476043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.34823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.301354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109089,"sim:weight":0.289573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.256853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109069,"sim:weight":0.246967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86024,"sim:weight":0.237552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.221384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108075,"sim:weight":0.220094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512474,"sim:weight":0.176334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Its purpose is twofold: firstly to develop an adequate understanding of reconciliation at the level of peoples and nations; and secondly to make a practical contribution to resolving the problems in Australia for the welfare of all the peoples, and of the land itself.\n\nThe history of the relationships between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in Australia has left many problems, and no matter what the non-Indigenous people try to do, the Indigenous peoples of Australia continue to experience themselves as being in a state of siege. Trying to understand what is happening, and what can be done to resolve the problems for the peoples of Australia and the land, have been the implicit drivers for the theological development in this thesis.\n\nThis thesis argues that the present generation in any trans-generational dispute is likely to continue to sin in ways that are shaped by the sins of the past, which explains why Indigenous peoples in Australia find themselves in a stage of siege, even when the non-Indigenous peoples are trying to pursue policies which they believe are for the welfare of all. The only way to resolve this is for the peoples of Australia to seek reconciliation. In particular, the non-Indigenous peoples need to repent, both of their own sins, and the sins of their forebears.\n\nReconciliation processes have become part of the international political landscape. However, there are real concerns about the justice of pursuing reconciliation. An important part of the theological development of this thesis is therefore to show that pursuing reconciliation establishes justice. It is shown that the nature of justice, and of repentance, can only be established by pursuing reconciliation. Reconciliation is possible because God has made it possible, and is working in the world to bring reconciliation.\n\nBecause land is an essential part of Indigenous identity in Australia, the history of land in court cases and legislation in Australia over the past half century forms an important case study in this work. It is shown that, although there was significant repentance within the non-Indigenous legal system in Australia, the degree of repentance available through that legal system is inherently limited, and so a more radical approach is needed in order to seek reconciliation in Australia. A final chapter considers what the non-Indigenous people of Australia need to do in order to repent.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burn, Geoffrey Livingston","Gorringe, Timothy Jervis"],"dc:date":"2010-06-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Utilising historical, contextual and philosophical forms of interpretation, it aims to explore whether Locke or Rousseau held consistent views about volition and what those were.  It then seeks to cash out these views for their understanding of political institutions and political agents.       This thesis explores the way Locke and Rousseau understood volition according to a traditional distinction between active and passive powers; however, both of them reconsider the nature of this dichotomy.  Locke, it is argued, thought volition could be either active or passive.  Rousseau, by contrast, believed volition to be a composite of interrelating active and passive capacities.  Both thinkers identify active willing with real virtue and freedom, and both believe a kind of sublimated love is essential to realise this activity.  Furthermore, this thesis considers the ways in which these theories of volition underlie Locke and Rousseau’s broader understandings of an agent’s disposition.  This links Locke’s views on active volition to the mentalities appropriate for discourse, philosophy and Christian charity.  Likewise, Rousseau’s understanding of true philosophy and virtue presuppose the conditions of active, moral will.\nThis thesis cashes out the political importance of volition for Locke and Rousseau in two ways: a) as a heuristic and polemical device to reject unacceptable forms of government and to construct appropriate ones; b) as a philosophical framework with which the relationship between political agents and political institutions can be explained and constructed so as to cultivate citizens’ active will.  Thus, the active dispositions appropriate to legitimate communication and politics are pivotal for Locke’s refutation of Filmer.  But further, Lockean politics is constituted to preserve a space in which active dispositions might actually flourish.   For Rousseau, the terms of the state of nature, the original compact and the Sovereign itself are all attuned to human agency, yet, this thesis explores how this scheme of political justice is only realised when the General Will is determined and enlightened.  Thus, Rousseau uses his understanding of agency to explain the Legislator, his relation to the body politic, and the subsequent relations amongst the people, the Sovereign, Government and public moeurs as actual phenomena by which an active will is evoked.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thompson, Benjamin Christopher","Hampsher-Monk, Iain"],"dc:date":"2009-01-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A Contextual Approach to the Gender Pay Gap in Managerial Positions","bibo:abstract":"Women are paid less than men in comparable occupations when human capital\nfactors are controlled for. This gender pay gap is particularly prominent in upper\nmanagement where on average female leaders are allocated 30 per cent less pay than male\nleaders. This thesis examines the underlying causes and the consequences of the gender pay\ngap in managerial positions by considering the organisational context (i.e., company\nperformance) and social context (i.e., women’s experiences in the workplace) in which\nthese differences emerge. First, three studies identify and examine gender disparities in the\nway in which performance-based pay is allocated as a function of company performance.\nSecond, a survey study takes the perspective of leaders themselves by considering gender\ndifferences in pay-related attitudes and their relationship to distinct gendered experiences in\nthe workplace.\nAn archival study (Study 1, N \u003d 192), an experiment (Study 2, N \u003d 201), and a\nsurvey (Study 3, N \u003d 180) investigated the role of gender in the relationship between\nmanagerial bonuses and company performance. In studies 1 and 3 the bonuses awarded to\nmen were larger than those allocated to women. Moreover, while the compensation of male\nleaders was sensitive to performance, such that they received greater bonuses the better\ntheir company performed, the bonuses awarded to female directors were not sensitive to\nperformance across all three studies. The psychological processes related to this\nphenomenon were explored in Study 2. It was found that, for a male leader, increasing\ncompany performance simply led to larger performance-related bonuses. However, for a\nfemale leader, the allocation of a bonus was based on perceptions of her charisma and\nleadership ability rather than resulting directly from company performance.\nv\nStudy 4 examines gender similarities and differences in attitudes towards pay and\npay negotiations. In a sample of 180 employees with managerial responsibilities, no gender\ndifferences in attitudes about the importance of pay were found. However, while female\nparticipants felt less confident than men about asking for pay rises, this was, at least in part,\nexplained by their negative workplace experiences, such as feeling to have to invest more\ntime and effort in order to achieve a pay rise and fearing negative responses when making\npay demands.\nThe importance of integrating the organisational and social context in the analysis\nof the gender pay gap is discussed in light of the limitations of a primarily individualistic\napproach. The role of the organisational context in moderating the attributional dynamics\nsurrounding pay and evaluation patterns is explained within the framework of literature on\nthe romance of leadership and gender stereotypes. The social context is considered in terms\nof the role of societal beliefs which may influence women’s decisions to opt out of top\nmanagerial jobs and their lack of confidence with pay negotiations. Finally, these findings\nare used to critique the tendency to blame women themselves for gender disparities in pay\nand their under-representation in managerial jobs, and instead I argue that it is\norganisational indifference towards women that perpetuates the gender pay gap.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kulich, Clara","Ryan, Michelle K.","Haslam, S.

Drawing from P. David Marshall’s work on defining performance codes from the music, film, and television industries, I examine film form and style to illustrate how the Beatles’ filmmakers used these codes in different combinations from previous pop and classical musicals in order to illicit certain responses from the audience. In doing so, the role of the audience from passive viewer to active participant changed the way musicians used film to communicate with their fans. I also consider how the Beatles’ image changed throughout their career as reflected in their films as a way of charting the band’s journey from pop stars to musicians, while also considering the social and cultural factors represented in the band’s image. Such elements in the Beatles’ carefully constructed image reflected youth culture and countercultural thoughts and beliefs. Finally, through a close analysis of the Beatles’ musical sequences I have shown how experimentation with artistic synergy enabled the band to produce new and innovative films and lyrics while allowing each member to develop as individual musicians. This experimentation and willingness to undermine traditional film and pop music practices helped to change artists’ approaches in the entertainment industries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Piotrowski, Stephanie Anne","Lyons, James"],"dc:date":"2008-10-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Attentional control theory (ACT), which suggests that anxious individuals have impaired goal-directed attentional control, was adopted as a theoretical framework, and the Quiet Eye, characterised by long final fixations on relevant locations, was adopted as an objective measure of overt attentional control. In Studies 1 and 2 increased pressure impaired goal directed attentional control (QE) at the expense of stimulus-driven control (more fixations of shorter duration to various targets). The aim of studies 3 and 4 was therefore to examine the efficacy of an intervention designed to train effective visual attentional control (QE training) for novices, and determine whether such training protected against attentional disruptions associated with performing under pressure. In both studies the QE trained group maintained more effective visual attentional control and performed significantly better in a subsequent pressure test compared to the Control group, providing support for the efficacy of attentional training for visuo-motor skills. The aim of study 5 was to examine the effectiveness of a brief QE training intervention for elite golfers and to examine if potential benefits shown for novices in studies 3 and 4 transferred to competitive play. The QE-trained group maintained their optimal QE and performance under pressure conditions, whereas the control group experienced reductions in QE and performance. Importantly, these advantages transferred to the golf course, where QE-trained golfers reduced their putts per round by 1.9 putts, compared to pre-training, whereas the control group showed no change in their putting statistics. This series of studies has therefore implicated the role of attention in the breakdown of performance under pressure, but has also suggested that visual attentional training regimes may be a useful technique for alleviating this problem.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vine, Samuel James","Wilson, Mark R"],"dc:date":"2010-10-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These irrigation systems are called aflāj (s. falaj), and they are still pivotal to community life: in 1997 over 3000 such systems were still in use.  The allocation of falaj water among farmers traditionally depended on the use of the sun and the stars to track the passage of time.  This practice, and particularly the use of stars, is disappearing rapidly:  the availability of watches since c. 1970 means that there is now little technical reason to use the stars. \n\nThe study records fast disappearing information on the ethnography of agricultural communities in northern Oman and, in particular, on the use of stars.  It aims to identify the stars used and record the methods of stargazing in sufficient detail that the systems could be replicated if all local knowledge were lost. It also aims to raise awareness and improve the understanding of the significance of the traditional use of the stars in irrigated agriculture. This aspect of the cultural heritage of the region has not been written about previously in such detail.\n\nThe research questions concern how, where and why stars are still used.\n\n\nThere are several documents on falaj building and organisation in Oman, but relatively little on telling the time, and much less on the stars than on the use of the sun.  The available documents were reviewed, but the main source for this study is data collected in the field, interviewing falaj managers and stargazers and watching the stars with them.  Field work was carried out in different seasons since the stars used vary through the year.   International experts were consulted on various aspects of the work, including Daniel Varisco on folk astronomy and Paul Kunitzsch on star names.\n\nThe study focuses on five settlements where stars are used to this day.  These are Qarya Beni Subh (Qarya), close to the mountains near the town of Al Hamra in the Interior Region; Al Fath, Zahib, Sudayra and Barzaman near the towns of Mudaybi and Sinaw in the Eastern Region.  Additional information was obtained from a few other places for comparison, and during the course of the research it was found that only about eight of three thousand active falaj communities still use stars for time keeping.\n\nThe methods of stargazing are given in detail, together with the names of the stars in Oman and their international classification where possible.  It was found that the number of stars, the stars used, and their names in Oman vary from place to place. The time that each star represents is more variable than expected from the difference in length of night during the year. The stars used for falaj purposes are compared with those used in the region for navigation and with the stations of the moon of the Islamic calendar, but no evidence of any link between them was identified. On the basis of the history of falaj systems in Oman, the star names and the stars used, at least two of which are from the pre-Islamic Bedu tradition, it is concluded that the system of stargazing for timing water dates from pre-Islamic times, before the introduction of the stations of the moon. \n\nThe main reason for the continued use of stars by a few communities, even though wristwatches are now widely available, is thought to be adherence to tradition both for its own sake and to avoid disputes over the sharing of water.  It is considered unlikely that this ancient practice will survive more than 10 or 20 years unless the younger generation takes an interest in learning, and putting into practice, the traditions of their forefathers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nash, Harriet","Agius, Dionisius"],"dc:date":"2008-10-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The thesis suggests that Bunbury’s privileged social position enabled him to become an eloquent and influential visual spokesman for both his class and his generation.  This thesis argues that Bunbury created iconic and influential images of ‘the Englishman’ in response to contemporary ideas regarding the Frenchman, the man of fashion, the soldier and performer, the amateur actor and the social and equestrian amateur.  This thesis also suggests that Bunbury’s art raises important questions regarding eighteenth century culture, including the nature of visual entertainment, fashionable art and celebrity and the relationship between the amateur and the professional artist.  The evaluation of Bunbury’s little-known prints emphasises their visual and cultural complexity and this contributes towards a new reading of the neglected historical period in which he operated.  Chapter one analyses the image of the foreign other and examines the demand for images that reinforced a sense of national superiority.  It also suggests that Bunbury’s successful graphic format reflected the audience desire to consume images that expressed an appetite for the amalgamation of fantasy with familiar experience.  Chapter two explores the idea of social disguise and transformation in the figure of the English Macaroni.  An examination of the ‘Promenade’ also suggests that Bunbury’s art capitalised on the audience’s need to view multiple reflections of itself.  Chapter three assesses the concentration on visual entertainment as a reaction to impending conflict and concludes that Bunbury configured society in terms of an audience united in the act of spectating.  Chapter four analyses the indulgence of all classes in visual escapism and dramatic role play and chapter five extends this discussion into Bunbury’s creation of large scale social and equestrian panoramas.  These images reveal his artistic formulation of an inclusive and democratic society, presided over by the figure of the ideal Englishman as a gentleman and a soldier.  The conclusion of this thesis is that a study of Bunbury’s neglected art offers a fresh and revealing insight into a period in the eighteenth century that has been consistently sidelined by criticism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roche, Karen Marie"],"dc:date":"2008-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

I undertake a re-interpretation of the Aristotelian terms for ‘plot’, which allows for a more nuanced examination of events occurring within a tragedy. As Aristotle notes, the systasis of pragmata is the structure of events that forms a tragedy. The muthos is the way in which these events are presented and includes the actions and words of the dramatis personae. Pragmata are constituent elements of both the systasis and muthos. This thesis identifies and evaluates the pragma’s effects upon the movement of the systasis, its contribution to the enrichment of the muthos and its influence on audience engagement with a performance through both enacted and non-enacted forms. \nMy approach involves a rigorous examination of the elements common to an enacted pragma, before identifying the variations therein. While a pragma involves all actions which serve the same general function, every instance of a pragma is unique. Each chapter in turn focuses on a particular pragma, before examining the role of that pragma within an entire tragedy. Enactments of each pragma in extant tragedy are tabled in appendices. The pragma of return home is examined within Andromache; recognition in Sophocles’ Elektra; supplication in Hekabe; and reporting in Women of Trachis. \nThis analysis demonstrates the dynamic role and versatility of different types of pragma within a tragedy, and the playwright’s ingenuity as demonstrated by his deployment of this element. No single approach or methodology can by itself fully interpret an Athenian tragedy, but a focus on a particular pragma illuminates different themes and emphases and ultimately provides us with a better understanding of a tragedy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fraser, Rowan Ellis Siobhan","Wright, Matthew"],"dc:date":"2010-07-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The use of reintroduction as a tool for the purpose of conserving species is becoming increasingly popular. Since many wild populations are declining, captive-bred stock are\nfrequently used to restore or supplement wild populations. Evidence suggests that captive-bred animals are less successful than their wild counterparts, but this has not been recently reviewed and there is limited research into investigating what aspects of captivity may be affecting success.\nHere, I conduct a review of carnivore reintroductions for projects carried out post 1990, which shows that captive-born animals are less likely to survive a release into the wild than their translocated wild-caught counterparts. A case study species, the endangered red panda (Ailurus fulgens), is used to investigate how a species involved in captive breeding for conservation\nresponds to life in captivity. Results from analyses of lifetime reproductive success (and related variables) showed that both adaptation to captivity and inbreeding depression are occurring in the global captive red panda population. An investigation into behavioural adaptation to captivity was less revealing, although only generations three to seven from the wild were observed. The effects of captive environment and husbandry regime were also investigated and revealed that the size of the useable area and amount of human contact were among the factors influencing the behaviours\nof red pandas. How these findings contribute to a greater understanding of effects of captivity is discussed. The use of selection criteria based on temperament was also investigated in order to improve the likelihood of survivorship upon release into the wild. This method needs to be tested\nin practice, but based on the selection criteria used, there was evidence that unsuitability for release was positively predicted by generation time in captivity. Implications for the future use of\ncaptive red pandas in efforts to conserve the species in the wild are discussed, as well as how these findings can be utilised for other species involved in conservation efforts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jule, Kristen","Leaver, Lisa","Lea, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2008-05-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It charts the transformations of the humoural condition in philosophy, anatomy and the medical treatise throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, from the renewed interest in the Renaissance of the ‘inspired’ form of melancholy by Florentine Neoplatonist Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499) to the middle of the seventeenth century in the writings of Thomas Browne (1605-1682). The first chapter serves as an introduction to the approach of the dissertation, which integrates a cultural historical approach to literary analysis of the Anatomy as some form of an anatomical treatise in the sense that it treats both a body of knowledge and knowledge of the body. Chapter two interrogates the distinction made by scholars between the ‘Ficinian’ and ‘Galenic’ forms of melancholy, and argues that sixteenth- and seventeenth-century humoural physiology recognises no such distinction, but rather that they serve as mutually sustainable responses to the problem presented to humoural physiology of visualising the interior of the living human body. Chapter three argues that, rather than using ‘anatomy’ and ‘melancholy’ as metaphorical constructs for rhetorical aims, the Anatomy pursues the intellectual possibilities implicit in anatomy as a highly procedural mode of analysis toward comprehending knowledge of a humoural body described in Galenic medicine, but that the text, as a result of the complications with completing such a body of knowledge, instead voices disembodiment. The fourth chapter proposes an analysis of Thomas Browne’s Hydriotaphia, known also as Urn Burial (1658), as having thematic continuity with both Burton’s Anatomy but also seventeenth-century humoural physiology as well, in that, while studying the past from the perspective of antiquarian speculation and cultural history, it concludes similarly that knowledge of the complete is impossible by the analysis of ruined and fragmentary objects and surfaces.","bibo:AuthorList":["Thompson, Dean","Edwards, Karen"],"dc:date":"2009-10-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The “voice” is multiple, ambiguous and influenced, but it is also apparently unique.  How, therefore, is it constructed and where does it come from?  I examine, work with and adapt Harold Bloom’s paradigmatic study of influence to a feminist context, exploring the idea that a literary voice can be developed and influenced by Atwood and Shields.  I discuss how these writers searched for an appropriate literary role model, exemplified by nineteenth-century English-Canadian writer Susanna Moodie, at the moment when Canadian nationalism and feminism coincided.  Atwood and Shields are now canonical writers themselves and important in both the nationalist and women’s tradition, but have they gone on to influence new Canadian women writers?  I test the pleasures and the anxieties of Shields’ influence with regard to her creative writing students and her own daughter, Anne Giardini, who has published her first novel.  I compare Shields with Atwood, who has achieved a high level of fame, and examine what kind of influence each exerts.  I discuss whether literary influence is politically different for women than men and whether there is any jealousy or power struggles between the sexes.  Rivalry and competition between writers are not purely caused by the aesthetic issues that Bloom discusses, therefore I contextualise his concept of influence using literary celebrity studies to consider the economic basis of cultural production.  This is in order to show that tensions are determined by market conditions, just as much as the new poet’s desire to overthrow a literary precursor.  Finally, I examine fan letters to Atwood and Shields as another important source of literary influence.  I discuss how fans are constructed through a commercial relationship and how they can also provide an amateur literary voice.  Atwood and Shields have helped to create a network of writers across the globe.  I explore whether both authors can be role models who will inspire the next literary generation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stead, Nicola Jayne","Jolly, Margaretta"],"dc:date":"2009-04-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A first look is taken at the history of theatre and drama as an educational subject up to the present day. Specific mention is given to the controversy between drama and theatre in the 1990s, and how it affected the progression and significance of the subjects in the curriculum. In addition, a re-examination takes place regarding theatre’s significance in adolescent development. The latter possesses several aspects that bear much poignancy and importance for the investigation which follows. The main concern of the research was to raise certain questions that will allow students to engage effectively in ancient Greek Drama whilst considering the historic-political background of the art, its form and its possible relevance to our times. The idea was that through providing a wider perspective, students would be able to reflect and form a clearer view of the subject. To explore and investigate these aims, an action research project was undertaken. The enquiry was driven by three main research questions that tackled the above concerns. Three projects were implemented in the same secondary school on the study of an ancient Greek play. The first two consisted of class work on the play Medea, whilst the third also included the attendance of students at a performance of Iphigenia at Aulis, directed by Katie Mitchell at the National Theatre in London. \n\nAnalysis of the data collected revealed that the three projects allowed active participation, reflection and a first engagement for students with this historical theatre form. At the same time weaknesses are revealed and certain areas proved to be dysfunctional or impractical. The discussion, situated in the last chapter, tries to review the structure of the research and to identify the elements that could have been improved. As a result, recommendations are listed to revisit fundamental questions that were raised at the beginning of the research. A change of focus is recommended to embrace the issue of why English students should engage with the art form and in which ways they can benefit best. In the light of these results, school conditions are taken into consideration in a discussion of new research methods and further practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gkatzioli, Christina","Somers, William John"],"dc:date":"2009-12-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

By viable, it is meant by definition that Islamic banking is a ‘vital, financially sustainable enterprise’ in the modern real world context. The methodology employed towards proving the efficacy of this distinctive religiously based system of finance, flows from the intuition that developing an intimate and comprehensive understanding of the various components from which the practice of Islam and Islamic banking has historically evolved, is a necessary and inseparable precondition to being able to address the issue of viability; an issue, the ultimate real time assessment of which it is also contended, must be left to the final portion of the thesis.  \n\nTowards this end, the present study ensues a constructive discourse of six chapters, with each chapter necessarily attending to a discrete, intelligible, analytical objective; yet is interconnected to the ultimate objective in that in due course, each piece incrementally and singularly contributes towards developing the requisite knowledge referred to above as being critical in order to make a determinative evaluation on the issue of viability.  Thus, the stages of informational development toward this evaluative ability follow the course initiated by a required investigation of (1) the historical purports, intellectual dynamics and restrictive frontiers of traditional paradigms; (2) the challenge of modernity that presently confronts the Islamic historical identity; (3) how that challenge facilitated the drive towards arriving at the theoretical underpinnings of a modern Islamic economic infrastructure; (4) how from that Islamic economic infrastructure the challenge of Islamic banking was effectuated; and (5) an attempt to evaluate Islamic banking in its real time context.  The information obtained was procured predominantly from written materials of those who in many cases are considered to be experts, pioneers, and/or advocates of what is intended to unfold with this newly developing system.  In addition, the author attended a number of Islamic conferences and seminars, affording a first hand opportunity to meet, study, and discuss, with those engaged in the blossoming world of the subject matter being investigated, inclusive of listening to and making the acquaintance of some of the leading proponents of Islamic Economics and Islamic Banking quoted in my thesis.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, in our modern day context, even the thought of an Islamically based banking system, originating from an indigenous series of economic propositions which in turn ultimately derive from basic and simple religious tenets, is almost literally unheard of.  While this may understandably be true for a majority of non-Muslims, it arguably remains true as well for a significant portion of practicing Muslims.    Thus arguably as well, a secondarily suggestive focus and challenge would be to determine whether such a system, borne of a distinctive religious culture, and originally intended to accommodate the needs of a singular religious population, can [reasonably be expected to] have any practical attraction to a wider variety of participants in and of the Western world, based as that world is, in its own economic and banking traditions; one which, with all its problems, still dominates the world today.  Here it will be argued that certain realities within the conventional banking regime have contributed towards facilitating the entry of Islamic banking, and in the process, have suggested the ethical and practical application of the Islamic banking approach to non-Muslims. \n\n  As well, regarding methodology, I attended a number of Islamic economic conferences and seminars, affording myself the opportunity to meet, study and pray with those engaged in the blossoming world of this and like subject matter, inclusive of listening to and making the acquaintance of some of the leading proponents of Islamic economics and banking quoted in my paper.\n\nIn the end, it was a matter of combining left and right brain approaches, that is, rigourous, disciplined study and analysis, coupled with consistent meditations upon the matters concerned, which brought about this presentation, both in style and substance.","bibo:AuthorList":["ben-Salahuddin, Robin","Choueiri, Youssef"],"dc:date":"2005-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Amidst a period of persistent negative returns on care delivery output, questionable quality issues, shrinking resources, public outcry about hospital performances and management distress, this study set up to identify and examine three aspects within operations management and strategy related to the healthcare in general and NHS healthcare delivery management  system in particular. \nThe first is to determine the type of strategic management model deployed by the NHS. Being the principal healthcare deliverer in the UK, the study initially assumes that the NHS deployed a robust cost management model which is hypothetically holistic and runs through the entire care delivery value chain. Investigation presented in this thesis shows that such a model is not in use within the NHS management framework. This vacuum led to the proposal that Target Cost Management (TCM) model could be adopted by the NHS. The main reason for this is that the TCM system will fits well within the NHS benchmarking operation and care delivery requirements.\nThe second aspect of the study seeks to understand what the TCM model is all about plus the reasons why it is being considered as a more superior system than other costing methods. When compared with the popular cost–plus or the traditional costing system, TCM is identified as being ex–ante, price based, dynamic and strategic, meeting modern cost management needs while others are more ex–post and cost – based and considered outdated. \nSeeking whether TCM could be applied in the NHS, a case study is designed to test the hypothesis thereby justifying such proposition since there is limited implementation of this phenomenon of interest in other studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ganye, Kwah Driscole","Maull, Roger"],"dc:date":"2008-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is in these outer regions that planets are thought\nto form out of the gas and dust within the circumstellar disk. Therefore, by observing\nyoung stellar objects at millimetre wavelengths we can determine the characteristics of circumstellar material, and hence, we can infer the possibility of a system forming planets.\nIn order to characterise the circumstellar environment of pre-main sequence stars, a\n3.3mm survey of continuum dust emission was performed using the OVRO interferometer\narray. A sample of targets in the nearby star forming region rho Ophiuchus were selected to encompass the entire range of pre-main sequence evolution, from starless clumps to Class III T Tauri stars. These data were then used to constrain properties of the circumstellar material in these young systems, in particular the dust opacity index, beta, and the mass of the material. The value of beta is used to study whether grain growth of the dust is occurring in these systems, which is a key stage in some planet formation models. Calculating the\nmass of the system can indicate whether enough circumstellar material is present to form planets. We also combine these new millimeter observations with literature data to create spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which are then fit in order to determine a best-fit model of the system using the models of Robitaille et al. (2007).\nWe find that the dust opacity index evolves from a value similar to that of the ISM\nfor the starless clumps beta ~ 2.3, to one closer to beta ~ 0.2 for the Class II objects. This low beta could be accounted for by the inclusion of larger grains within the disk, indicating the possibility of grain growth through the evolutionary stages of a young system. For the Class I and Class II sources we find similar trends in beta to those found in Andrews \u0026 Williams (2007a). An estimate of circumstellar mass assuming a constant dust opacity index was made using the flux of each source. Carrying out this calculation yielded a mean mass of 0.033Msun, with almost 50% of the sources having a mass \u003e 0.01Msun. A more in\ndepth estimate of mass was also performed using the value newly calculated value of the\ndust opacity index. The mass estimates indicated many of the sources observed by this survey have the mass of dust available in the system to form planets.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hogg, David Forbes","Patience, Jennifer"],"dc:date":"2009-03-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is through a combination of contemporary discourses that I investigate this topic - through the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, as well as treatises and polemical debate.  I also place this work at the juncture of psychoanalysis and literature.  To fully explore these texts, I use Sigmund Freud’s 1919 essay ‘The Uncanny’, as well as some of Julia Kristeva’s ideas about abjection and boundary crossing.  I argue that early modern death and dying is inextricably associated with femininity, a motif seen repeatedly in the writings of the period.  Femininity points to what is designated as Other, that which crosses borders, as is the uncanny.  I will show that it is through uncanny and feminine repetitions on stage and in discourse that we see the workings of death in the gaps within the text.  Language and the workings of signification often point to feminine death, operating at a juncture of absence and presence, as does Renaissance theatre.  This puzzle, this conundrum is at the heart of this research.\nI start by considering the dying woman and the potency of the deathbed.  Here I engage with the readings we may take from her which conversely point to a blurring of boundaries.  The corpse, both real and acted is another focus I take.  I explore how gender operates in the dead body, articulating new anxieties about endings.  Feminine memorial is my next area of research.  Here I argue that different ways of remembering not only embody cultural anxieties, but point to dissolution of identity.  Finally I explore the question of ghosts on the early modern stage.  I discover that the post Reformational ghost is feminised and impotent in whatever form it takes.  Yet conversely it creates anxiety in those around it, despite occupying a marginalised position.  All these areas revolve around a nexus of uncanny textual contradictions, sometimes in image or tableaux, always in language.","bibo:AuthorList":["Huxham, Claire Joanne","Schwyzer, Philip"],"dc:date":"2009-07-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Concurrently, organisations are entering into long-term buyer-supplier relationships.  Marketing research supports the importance of adopting customer value strategies, linking them to customer learning, product and service delivery and, more recently, relational contexts.  Yet, little is known about how customer-perceived value is created and delivered through (or in) a long-term relationship – the tendency is to focus on transactional exchanges and describe the (resulting) relationship as a source of value.\nThis thesis presents a single case study, examining how customer value is created and delivered through a long-term industrial buyer-supplier relationship.  Adopting a qualitative research approach, we examine the buyer and supplier perspectives.  Through an analysis of multiple data sources, we demonstrate suppliers must learn continuously about customers’ needs.  Such learning should then be reinforced further through learning how to respond to those needs.  As a consequence, suppliers may have to develop their own competencies, in addition to customers’ competencies.  Furthermore, we find sound business processes are required to deliver competencies, along with a combination of goods and services.\nThese findings are presented as four strategy elements – ongoing value learning, process development, employee competency development, and product and service delivery – along with a model to help visualise the connection between them, and thus demonstrate how, through a long-term relationship, buyer value may be consciously and systematically created and delivered over time.\n\tThe implications of our findings are important to the practice and theory of marketing and relationship value in particular.  They help to provide some practical guidance to understand the elements required to create customer value strategies through industrial relationships.  Further, our findings confirm the importance of considering a multiple stakeholder perspective, and the need for future research to focus on understanding the different interactional complexities that occur between buyers and suppliers who are highly interdependent and create value with joint skills and knowledge.","bibo:AuthorList":["Scott, James Jonathan","Ng, Irene C.

The aim of this enquiry was to explore the interface between performance management and leadership development systems and the extent to which they can complement one another to offer a coherent progression and performance framework. A number of competing and inter-related dynamics were uncovered that influence the extent to which performance management systems facilitate appropriate and desirable forms of behaviour in organisations and the extent to which these are supported and reinforced through leadership development.  The most significant of these influences was seen to be one of identity and the impact that these systems can have on a sense of shared ‘social identity’ and purpose. By way of conclusion we argue that the narrative function of corporate leadership systems in expressing ‘who we are’ and ‘what we value’ is equally, if not more, important in determining their impact (positive or negative) than their corrective or developmental capacity per se.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bolden, Richard","Gosling, Jonathan","Adarves-Yorno, Inmaculada","Burgoyne, John"],"dc:date":"2008-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Whilst there is a general shift from formalised programmes towards flexible, experiential and customised provision, it seems that insufficient attention remains directed towards individual and organisational needs and requirements. Thus, for example, the majority of provision remains focused on the development of ‘leaders’ rather than the contextually embedded and collective processes of ‘leadership’. Management and leadership are presented as distinct rather than integrated and complementary activities/processes and limited consideration is given to the impact of contextual factors on individual and organisational performance. The article concludes with a series of questions/issues for individuals and organisations to consider when investing in leadership and/or management development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bolden, Richard"],"dc:date":"2007-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

As Peter Drucker once remarked, the 20th century produced three great leaders: Hitler, Stalin and Mao. Conversely, many leaders who fail to achieve their aims nonetheless deserve respect and praise. In fact we can probably learn more about how to do good by studying those who struggle for it in almost impossible circumstances. This is what we had in mind when we first took a group of company executives to Sarajevo in 1996, shortly after the signing the cease-fire known as the Dayton Accord. The context was a short course on leadership of change and continuity, conceived by one of the authors, co-ordinated by the other and commissioned by British Aerospace plc (now BAE Systems plc). Our aim was to study what happens when ‘transformation’ becomes an overwhelming reality. We learned a good deal about change, continuity and leadership; but we learned more about this radical approach to management education, which is the focus of this paper. We offer as a case-study one particular encounter drawn from over 10 years of engagement. In summer of 2004 three former Prime Ministers of Bosnia-Herzegovina met with a group of senior executives (mainly British and American) to reflect on this particular leadership role. The paper explores both the content and process of this ‘event’, with commentary on: a) the role of the individual leader, illuminated by the fact that we studied three people who have consecutively held the same post, within and impacting on the ’same’ context; b) the practice of reflection in this particular setting; that is, how to be reflective and to draw lessons from experiences riddled with the presence of evil; c) the design and ethics of leadership development programmes in which the moral predicaments of participants become the central topic. We conclude that management education must be radically reconfigured if it is to address greatness as well as effectiveness. The emancipatory aims of so-called critical management education go some way to addressing our concerns, but our own case presents us with grounds for profound pessimism, in the light of which we find hope only in the possible cathartic effects of confronting the tragic aspects of leadership and change. We recommend leadership development and management education that engages with these ethical realities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gosling, Jonathan","Purg, Dancia"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Cornish ethnoregionalism presents a paradox; a minority nationalist movement that has sustained itself politically for more than a half a century, culturally for more than century, yet one that has achieved little electoral or policy success. It is argued here that Cornwall has been conceptualised hitherto too rigidly within one of two paradigms – as a Celtic country or as an English county. Instead, recognising this hybridity allows us to extend Lieven De Winter’s work on European ethnoregionalist parties to explain both the weakness of Cornish ethnoregionalism and its persistence, albeit at relatively low levels of activity. By investigating the Cornish case theory on ethnoregionalist parties is applied comparatively, leading to the conclusion that utilising a number of perspectives at differing scales opens out our understanding of concrete cases of minority nationalism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Deacon, Bernard"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This article adopts the suggestion of Wahrman that a ‘space of possibilities’ exists where these apparently competing perspectives might be connected. The concept of a ‘space of possibilities’ is pursued through a case study of a marginal group, the fishing communities of west Cornwall in the late nineteenth century. The article explores points of contact and contrast between artistic and the fishing communities, between the painterly gaze and the subjects of that gaze.

This suggests that the working classes in the cities led a move away from the churches in the second half of the nineteenth century, if not before. Recent work, however, presents a growing challenge to this account, instead stressing continuities of religious practice and belief into the 20th century. This article reviews this revisionism. It asks why revival occurred when and where it did, which groups were associated with 19th century denominations and how religious identities changed. In doing this it also suggests areas for further local research. The periods before the 1840s and after the 1910s, regions and localities outside London, and the patterns of everyday religious practice and belief, are themes on which community historians can address a host of under researched issues.","bibo:AuthorList":["Deacon, Bernard"],"dc:date":"2002-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This dissertation explores the territorial identity of Cornwall in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The study does three things; it defines Cornish identity on the basis of concepts of distinction, integration, process, narrative, context and scale; it applies the model of regional identity formation proposed by Anssi Paasi; and it develops the disciplinary approach of the new Cornish Studies. The subject of the dissertation is the period after the fragmentation of a linguistically based ethnic identity and before the reconstruction of a ‘Celtic’ Cornish identity. A comparative investigation of this phase of the history of identity transformation restores continuity between Cornwall’s industrial and post-industrial periods and provides an account of modern Cornish identity. The first part of the dissertation reviews representations of Cornwall and its people in the early nineteenth century. The focus then shifts to discuss the structures and institutions – economic, social and religious – around which identities cohered. The argument of the thesis is that industrialisation based on deep metal mining gave the Cornish a renewed pride as inhabitants of one of Europe’s first centres of industrialisation. In this sense Cornwall resembled other industrial regions in the early nineteenth century British Isles. However, it also differed from them, most notably in its demography, in the social relations produced by rural industrialisation and in the way its historians had re-fashioned a history of the Cornish as a distinct group. By the later nineteenth century a hybrid identity had emerged, one based on a regional pride induced by industrialisation but one that also looked back to symbols of ethnic distinctiveness. This regional identity nested within identities of Englishness and Britishness that constrained its political potential.","bibo:AuthorList":["Deacon, Bernard"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The model is used to study the long-run and transient effect on cattle of culling badgers and the effect of a period without routine testing for TB, such as occurred during the 2001 epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease in Great Britain. Finally, by examining the changes in cattle TB over the last 15 years, and with some other working assumptions, it is estimated that the net reproduction number of the epidemic is 1.1. The implications for controlling the disease are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cox"],"dc:date":"2005-12-06","doi":"10.1073/pnas.0509003102","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Its relocation to new premises, the broadened remit to cover all Arab countries, and the transfer of its management from the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies to the University Library all meant that the Unit’s unwritten mission and goals, as well as its organisational structure, needed to be re-evaluated and reformulated. This study seeks to provide a framework for the formulation of a written collection management policy and a mission statement for AWDU, in order to define a consistent practise for future systematic maintenance and management of the collection. This is achieved by examining the Unit’s collections, services and facilities through selected elements of the collection management policy. A user-centred evaluation of the AWDU collections and services is conducted through a survey of two major user groups, the faculty and students of IAIS. 57% of the faculty and 21% of the students responded to the questionnaires. In order to understand the role of the Documentation Unit on the local and national levels, its history and development are documented, and the motives and reasons behind its establishment are examined in the context of Arabic and Middle Eastern studies in the UK.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abu-Zayed, Ahmed"],"dc:date":"2003-05-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Increasingly, many users require their information immediately and really do not care where it is stored. Such demands, coupled with librarians’ natural tendency to apply order, have led to the development of library portals which aim to solve the problems arising from trying to navigate this labyrinth of information. The MAP portal is one such product. Using the NISO OpenURL standard, MAP offers three main elements – contextual linking via WebBridge, one step “multi” searching using MetaFind and resource authentication through Web Access Management (WAM). Use of this portal at the University of Exeter Library has made a considerable, positive impact on the recent use of online full-text systems and services and the experiences undoubtedly point to a strong future for such interfaces everywhere.","bibo:AuthorList":["Myhill, Martin"],"dc:date":"2005-02","doi":"10.1108/14684520510583918","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

DG provides an improved power quality, higher reliability of the distribution system and covering of peak shaves. Penetration of a DG into an existing distribution system has so many impacts on the system, despite the benefits a DG will provide; it has a negative impact on one of the most important aspects of the system which is the power system protection, and it is a main factor affecting both reliability and stability of the system. DG causes the system to lose its radial power flow, besides the increased fault level of the system caused by the DG. In this thesis, the effect of DG penetration on the short circuit level of the network is investigated through simulating the IEEE 13 bus test feeder using ETAP. The simulation is repeated for nine different cases at which the location of one large DG is changed in six of the cases to study the effect of the distance on the fault level, while the rest of the cases are performed using small decentralised DGs. The result of those three cases at which the DG is decentralised are used to investigate the effect of the generating capacity of the generation unit on the distribution network parameters and on the currents flowing through the laterals of the distribution network. Results are compared to that of the normal case to investigate the impact of the DG on the short circuit currents flowing through different branches of the network to deduce the effect on protective devices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Elmathana, Mohamed Talal Mohamed","Zobaa, Ahmed","Smith, George"],"dc:date":"2010-10-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24078,"sim:weight":0.576884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5845011,"sim:weight":0.557817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5846534,"sim:weight":0.403149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84850,"sim:weight":0.318667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5845633,"sim:weight":0.277412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85296,"sim:weight":0.272337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66737,"sim:weight":0.259781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108877,"sim:weight":0.244554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108345,"sim:weight":0.243647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108846,"sim:weight":0.229134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734349,"sim:weight":0.21969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512829,"sim:weight":0.189304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931258,"sim:weight":0.179241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108740,"sim:weight":0.175495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108810,"sim:weight":0.165973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8826907,"sim:weight":0.150795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study also seeks to further the feminist poststructuralist research within the Iranian TESOL and bridge the substantive gap within the existing literature, which is an almost untouched area of research regarding the teachers’ identity formation. \n\nThis thesis attempts to explore the construction of identities of eight Iranian female teachers of English and the discourses that shape them through examining their narratives, using data gathered from interviews and email correspondences. In a two-year collaboration with the participants, I applied a feminist poststructuralist conceptual framework to examine the participants’ main subject positions and the prevailing discursive practices that construct them. The research data, collected by individual interviews and email correspondence, indicates the teachers’ identities as multiple, complex, and contradictory. I contend that multiple subject positions stem out of the clash of the multiple discourses that are available to them. Impacted by both gender and professional discourses that sometimes even collide, the findings show how these women struggle to conceive a sense of coherent self. The results of the analysis indicate that the gender and professional discourses are of normative, disciplinary, and individualizing nature. Negotiating identities within themselves and within the complex cultural context they live in, these female teachers are involved in an ongoing process of adjustment, adaptation and resistance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Khoddami, Fariba","Troudi, Salah"],"dc:date":"2010-09-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The new organisation did not evolve naturally from the mediaeval guilds and religious orders that pre-dated it, but was reconfigured radically by a largely self-appointed inner core.  Freemasonry became a vehicle for the expression and transmission of the political and religious views of those at its centre, and for the scientific Enlightenment concepts that they championed.  The ‘Craft’ also offered a channel through which many sought to realise personal aspirations: social, intellectual and financial.  \n\nThrough an examination of relevant primary and secondary documentary evidence, this thesis seeks to contribute to a broader understanding of contemporary English political and social culture, and to explore the manner in which Freemasonry became a mechanism that promoted the interests of the Hanoverian establishment and connected and bound a number of élite metropolitan and provincial figures.  A range of networks centred on the aristocracy, parliament, the magistracy and the learned and professional societies are studied, and key individuals instrumental in spreading and consolidating the Masonic message identified.  The thesis also explores the role of Freemasonry in the development of the scientific Enlightenment.\n\nThe evidence suggests that Freemasonry should be recognised not only as the most prominent of the many eighteenth century fraternal organisations, but also as a significant cultural vector and a compelling component of the social, economic, scientific and political transformation then in progress.","bibo:AuthorList":["Berman, Richard Andrew","Black, Jeremy","Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas"],"dc:date":"2010-09-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

While Darwin’s idea of female preference being an integral mechanism of sexual selection is no longer debated, our understanding of female preference is still very limited. For example, we know little about the genetic variation in female preference, and the costs of preference over and above the costs of mating with particular male phenotypes. Additionally, while costs of mate choice are well documented, the benefits of mate choice and their implications are still debated. For example, controversy exists over the inevitability of good gene benefits and their capability to promote adaptive sexual selection. Furthermore, the adaptiveness of sexual selection itself is debated. Our understanding of the traits involved in mate choice is also far from complete. Here I investigated aspects of sexual selection in Drosophila simulans, employing a range of behavioural approaches along with artificial selection and environmental manipulations. The findings presented here indicate that female preference can evolve when directly selected on, and that preference itself is not particularly costly. There was also no conclusive evidence for the good genes benefits of mate choice in D. simulans. These benefits are considered crucial in promoting the adaptiveness of sexual selection, and although we found sexual selection to be adaptive under some test conditions it was not adaptive in other conditions. Our investigations into traits involved in mate choice established sex-specific genetic variation in cuticular hydrocarbons and the genetic architecture of this trait was found to sex-specific evolution of cuticular hydrocarbons under natural and sexual selection. Additionally, we found that a secondary sexual character, the sex combs was positively allometric – just like most signalling and weapon traits, and there was no association between trait fluctuating asymmetry and trait size. These findings collectively indicate that sexual selection in D. simulans is consistent with classical models of this process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sharma, Manmohan Dev","Hosken, David J","Tregenza, Tom"],"dc:date":"2010-10-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Nevertheless, throughout the history of Petrine scholarship the nature of this problem has generated significant disagreement. Within the most recent discussion, however, a general consensus has been reached. Virtually all commentators now tend to agree that this conflict is a kind of unofficial, local hostility which arose sporadically out of the disdain from the general populace and which was expressed primarily through discrimination and verbal abuse. Ultimately, though, this position rests on a number of undemonstrated contentions which have never been examined through comprehensive and detailed socio-historical inquiry.\nThe present study is intended to take up the question afresh and to thereby rectify the significant missteps through which the topic has been previously approached. Our purpose is to determine the nature of suffering in 1 Peter by situating the letter against the backdrop of conflict management in first-century CE Asia Minor. To do so, we seek to understand the different means by which conflict was dealt with in Roman Anatolia and how the persecutions of 1 Peter fit into this larger context. Part of this goal is to examine how conflict affected different social groups within the community as a way of determining the various forms of suffering to which specific members may have been prone. Therefore, our efforts consist of an attempt to differentiate the readers’ troubling experiences by providing a detailed “social profile” of the letter’s recipients and to contextualize the conflict situation by locating the problem and its subsequent resolution strategies within the world of first-century CE Asia Minor","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Travis Benjamin","Horrell, David"],"dc:date":"2010-10-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Though, the information service sector has grown significantly, there have been relatively few attempts by researchers to explore this sector. The lack of research in this sector has motivated my PhD research that aims to explore the pre-established relationships between dependability, quality and customer satisfaction (RQ1) within the context of information service sector. Literature looking at the interrelationship between the dependability and quality (RQ2a), and their further impact on customer satisfaction (RQ2b) is also limited. With the understanding that Business to Business (B2B) and Business to Customer (B2C) businesses are different, exploring these relationships in these two different types of information firms will further add to existing literature. This thesis also attempts to investigate the relative significance of dependability and quality in both B2B and B2C information service firms (RQ3a and RQ3b). To address these issues, this PhD research follows a theory testing approach and uses multiple case studies to address the research questions. In total five cases from different B2B and B2C information service firms are being investigated. To explore the causality, the time series data set of over 24 to 60 months time and the ‘Path Analysis’ method has been used. For the generalization of the findings, Cumulative Meta Analysis method has been applied. \n\nThe findings of this thesis indicate that dependability significantly affects customer satisfaction and an interrelationship exists between dependability and quality that further impacts customer satisfaction. The findings from B2C cases challenges the traditional priority afforded to relational aspect of quality by showing that dependability is the key driver of customer satisfaction. However, B2B cases findings shows that both dependability and quality are key drivers of customer satisfaction. Therefore, the findings of this thesis add considerably to literature in B2B and B2C information services context.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kumar, Vikas","Maull, Roger","Smart, Andi"],"dc:date":"2010-09-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Although almost all EU and OECD member states have adopted RIA, only a sub- set of small-n case comparative studies on institutional, political and administrative impact have been conducted. By filling this gap in the literature and proposing the rigorous operationalisation of concepts such as adoption, extent of implementation, and learning, this thesis ascertains the extent of interdependency among governments in their choices concerning an innovation of regulatory governance. Methodologically, the dissertation draws on a multi-method approach, consisting of qualitative analysis to track the process of institutionalisation, as well as event history analysis, based on a dataset covering thirty-eight countries from 1968 to 2006.\nThe empirical findings show that diffusion is a multifaceted process. In the decision to adopt RIA, the role of the OECD in translating, packaging, and promoting such administrative innovation coexists with previous innovations and other administrative variables. Yet the impact of interdependency is marginal in the successive phases of implementation and evaluation. Earliness of adoption is the major predictor of the extent of implementation. There is little evidence of interaction and communication among adopters on the subject of their learning experience. On balance, this regulatory governance innovation is a domain of symbolic and rhetorical meanings that is not adequately supported by administrative capacity.","bibo:AuthorList":["De Francesco, Fabrizio","Radaelli, Claudio M.","Dunlop, Claire A"],"dc:date":"2010-07-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Furthermore, the global increase in the number of captive Arabian oryx (currently more than 95 % of the world population of about 8000 individuals), gives rise to particular concern for their welfare and health within captive conditions.\nThorough assessment of the welfare of animals involves physiological and behavioural measures. Methods for assessment of welfare in Arabian oryx have not been established and the present studies aim at establishing physiological tools for assessment of welfare. Therefore, the present studies developed and applied new methods for non-invasive assessment of welfare in the Arabian oryx (using faecal samples), and established reference values for a range of haematological, biochemical and clinical parameters. The potential disturbances in these parameters were investigated after immobilisation and tranquillisation and post- transportation. \nTwo enzyme immuno-assays (EIA I and II) for faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) were validated by stimulation and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis through injection of synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and dexamethasone, respectively. These studies established a lag-time of 14 ± 1 h between secretion of glucocorticoids into the blood stream and excretion of the measured FGM. Faecal incubation at 30°C for 3 days showed that EIA I measured more stable faecal glucocorticoid metabolites than EIA II, and has greater potential for application in field conditions. This method was found to be invaluable for measuring stress and hence assessment of welfare status, and its use is recommended in planning welfare improvements. Measurement of FGM successfully detected the stress of road transportation (630 km for 8-10 h), showing an increase 2 days after transport, followed by recovery to basal FGM levels after re-housing for up to 11 days. Releasing oryx to the wild, in Oman, and tracking for 11 days, after transportation 50-70 km from the captive site (Arabian Oryx Sanctuary, Jaaluni), caused an increase in FGM to the highest levels seen in these studies, and suggests a high level of stress was experienced after release of oryx. \nPublished reference values for haematological, biochemical, hormonal and clinical parameters for Arabian oryx are limited, with little information for non-immobilised and non-tranquillised oryx or consideration of possible age and sex differences. Therefore, reference values and inter-percentile ranges (2.5 and 97.5 percentiles) were established for 32 parameters, in separate groups of male and female adult oryx, without using immobilising or tranquillising chemicals during capture. The haematological parameters investigated were white blood cell count and differentiation (%) of cell types (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), number of platelets, red blood cell count, haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit, erythrocyte cell volume, erythrocyte haemoglobin content and concentration, serum osmolality and ions (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus). Biochemical parameters investigated were serum urea, glucose, total protein, albumin and plasma lactate concentrations. Clinical parameters investigated were body temperature, heart and respiratory rates. Hormonal parameters measured were cortisol, free-thyroxine, free-triiodothyronine and insulin concentrations. Near basal values for serum cortisol were measured in Arabian oryx sampled within 2 min, while values were significantly higher in oryx sampled within 5-10 min. The reference values established in these studies are considered valuable tools for diagnosis of disease and physiological alterations in male and female Arabian oryx.\nTo investigate the possible effects of the common practice of immobilisation and tranquillisation on physiological and biochemical status, two restraint chemicals (xylazine and perphenazine enanthate) were evaluated. Xylazine (an immobilising agent) caused changes in many clinical, hormonal, haematological and biochemical parameters; respiratory rate decreased by 74 %, heart rate decreased by 58 %, causing a decrease in red blood cell count, haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit, serum albumin and total protein concentration. Xylazine also induced a decrease in serum insulin, which probably caused the observed increase in serum glucose.\nPerphenazine enanthate (a long-acting tranquilliser) was found to have no adverse effects on most parameters, which generally remained in the reference ranges. However, a reduction in blood haematocrit and related parameters (red blood cell count and plasma haemoglobin concentration) occurred, 1-3 days after injection. The tranquilliser also plays a role in reducing stress and significantly reduced serum cortisol 2-3 days after injection in oryx held in captivity compared to oryx that received a saline (control) injection. FGM increased significantly one day after injection of perphenazine enanthate and saline, suggesting the animals were initially stressed by the handling and venipuncture, taking into consideration the lag-time from cortisol secretion to appearance of FGM. \nThe baseline concentration of serum cortisol was used in assessing the stress caused by handling before and after transporting Arabian oryx for 630 km (8-10 h) and the acute effects of handling and injections. Increased serum cortisol was always associated with leukocytosis, neutrophilia and lymphopenia. Serum cortisol of non-transported oryx was reduced by the tranquilliser perphenazine enanthate, but transportation of tranquillised Arabian oryx during hot ambient temperature (maximum 42 °C) resulted in fatigue and prevented reaching a clear conclusion of the role of the tranquilliser in reducing transport stress. Non-tranquillised oryx transported at a maximum of 26-30 °C showed a similar level of stress as implied by the level of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites, but without fatigue. However, the tranquilliser induced calmness in Arabian oryx for up to 7 days, which facilitated capture and handling. Therefore, perphenazine enanthate has a potential to be used in the management practices, such as movement and transport of Arabian oryx.\nThis thesis discusses the current and future welfare issues that face Arabian oryx in captivity, upon release and in the wild. Additional methods are proposed for thorough assessment and improvement of welfare to complement the methods established by the present studies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al Jahdhami, Mansoor","Brown, Anne"],"dc:date":"2010-01-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It will also suggest that he remains so little known amongst the pantheon of British admirals of the Napoleonic era because the traditional measure of value of a naval commander is success in battle. Although Rainier had a reputation as a fighting captain, as a commander in chief he saw action only in combined operations. Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that skill other than fighting battles is important. Rainier’s thorough knowledge of the station, his capacity to work with people over whom he had no authority, his ability to protect a rapidly expanding and wealth creating trade, and his administrative and financial professionalism, enabled him to play an important, if secondary, part in the establishment of the Second British Empire which, arguably, had a far greater impact on British history than all but the most seminal battle.\n\nThe East Indies Station had a number of unique elements that heavily influenced the actions of its commander in chief. The two-way communication process between Rainier and the Admiralty could take a whole year. Its thirty million plus square mile area meant that communication and logistics within the station needed long term planning. It was still relatively unfamiliar to British navigators, and charting it was still in progress. \n\nThe relationship between the admiral and the East India Company, the official government of British India, could make or break the success of both the navy and the Company. With his diplomatic skills and wide experience of the station, Rainier worked with its officials and army commanders to defend current British possessions in the East Indies and India, to extend them to such an extent that, by his return to Britain, they were the foundation of the second British Empire. During this period the centre of power on the station moved eastwards as the value of trade with China overtook that with India – Rainier had to take this into account when allocating his resources. The constraints on navigation and timing caused by the narrow channels in the East Indies and by the weather made it easier for enemy vessels to know by which route the British trade would travel. Rainier had to cover potential threats off Macao, through the Straits of Bali, Banda, Sunda and Malacca, in the Bay of Bengal, off Madras, around Ceylon and between Bombay and the Persian Gulf. When possible he had to cover the French naval base at Mauritius.  With a limited number of vessels,  of which some were always in need of repair, Rainier was often on the defensive. Acquisition of new colonies opened new trading routes which, together with his commitment to trade protection, led to a steady, if often unregulated, expansion in British trade. His attention to detail and his management skills also allowed him to establish an efficient logistics, victualling and financial operation. \n\nWhat Rainier achieved has to be seen in the context of the complexity of his station and the role of the East India Company. Then it stands far above the level of its absolute achievement. This thesis shows that Rainier’s organization and man management skills, unruffled nature, sound strategic judgement made him a “Safe Pair of Hands”, ideal for such a detached but important command.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ward, Peter","Duffy, Mike"],"dc:date":"2010-09-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Made by filmmakers associated with the Hollywood Renaissance, these Westerns are celebrated for openly critiquing the ethos of the mythic American West and appropriating the genre’s conventions for social commentary. This study argues that the veneration of this canon of films has resulted in a distorted and incomplete picture of the Western at the time, which has consequences for cultural histories that read Westerns as a reflection of American society. Drawing on an extensive viewing of Westerns released in and around the period in question, this project seeks to uncover the complexity and multiplicity of the Western of the time. It reconsiders the genre’s relationship with American history and politics, including the plight of the American Indian and America’s military involvement in Vietnam; examines the changing representations of frontier heroes Wyatt Earp and Jesse James; draws attention to a number of neglected or misinterpreted movies and trends, including the later Westerns of actor John Wayne; and dispels the idea that the disastrous Heaven’s Gate (1980) was responsible for “killing” the Western. These analyses reveal not only connections between canonical and lesser-known works, but also continuities between these and older Westerns – an ongoing, cyclical process of regeneration that transcends established divisions in the genre’s history. In doing so, the project works revise our understanding of the Western of this period, and to add to our knowledge of the genre as a whole.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nelson, Andrew Patrick","Neale, Steve"],"dc:date":"2010-08-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This remarkable gap, taken together with the absence of a prologue, the presence of a number of prominent themes and authorial concerns, and the complex literary construction of the work, has made the task of explaining it problematic. Situating the text in the context of Xenophon\u0027s later life and wide-ranging literary output, in this dissertation I argue that apologia is the defining element in the work. Through his elaborate narrative structure and representation of his own character, Xenophon is defending himself, his social class, and his teacher, Socrates. In Books 5 and 7 (of 7) he is occupied with a rigorous defence of his conduct on the retreat, answering charges of deceiving the soldiers, hubris, corruption, and mercenary service, while in Books 3 through to 7, he is defending the memory of Socrates. For from the point of his introduction into the text at the opening of Book 3, following the decapitation of the Greek High Command at the Greater Zab River, Xenophon the character is acting as a pupil of Socrates would have done had he found himself in similarly dire circumstances. His actions, counsel, and moral bearing during the course of the retreat are a testimony to the value of his teacher\u0027s training, and powerfully undermine the charges of impiety and corrupting the youth levelled against Socrates in 399. At the same time, the outstanding leadership performance on the retreat of Xenophon\u0027s character reflects on himself as the historical figure behind the exemplar. By highlighting its different forms and bringing out its pervasiveness, the dissertation demonstrates that apologia is the major factor in the formation of the text.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brennan, Shane Geoffrey","Mitchell, Stephen","Ogden, Daniel"],"dc:date":"2011-01-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

One of the major implications of this reform has been the need to identify any groups within the population who underachieve educationally with the intention of providing additional support. The role of designated teacher and use of the Personal Education Plan has been established within school settings, however, the process of supporting young people entering care within college settings has remained relatively unexplored.\n\nThis study reports a qualitative exploration of core subject teachers in the support of young people entering care in Key Stage 4.

Data was collected using focus groups to elicit the views of the professionals who teach young people entering care. Data was analysed using Thematic Analysis (Braun \u0026 Clarke, 2006).\n\nThe findings of the study suggest that teaching staff identify individual need in response to conflict (in the form of response to presenting behaviour within school).

When various generations of currency crisis are considered, it is observed that the financial system and fragilities associated with it plays a critical role in more recent crisis episodes. Therefore, focusing on the financial system can possibly lead to a better understanding of how and why these crises took place. The analysis presented here aims to provide some new insights about this topic. \nIn the first chapter I tried to analyze how public borrowing can affect financial fragility when how a private bank finances its lending to the government is private information. I built a simple theoretical model where the government basically borrows from a commercial bank. The objective of the government is to realize borrowing at the lowest possible cost but at the same time it cares about the financial stability. The risk averse commercial bank, on the other hand, maximizes utility by allocating the financing of its lending among a safe and a risky loan where the amount it uses from the safe source considered to be a measure of financial stability. Moral hazard arises as the amount of safe loan used is not observable to the government. Under the assumption that the risk premium is decreasing in income, I show, when the government is not able push the rate down below a certain level, it can trade a rise in borrowing costs with some financial stability. In other words, although pushing the rate down is good both for borrowing costs and financial stability, under asymmetric information, it may be optimal to design a contract with a reward scheme and accept a higher cost for borrowing for a relatively more reliable financial system. This chapter contributes to the literature by identifying a potential moral hazard problem in the process of public borrowing and displays how it can lead to a higher than optimal level of financial fragility when the economic policy gets obsessed with lowering the borrowing costs. The analysis provided is also interesting as it displays an unusual case where the borrower rather than the lender faces issues resulting from asymmetric information.    \n    In the second chapter, a bank-run model used to analyze effects of uncertainty on financial fragility in terms of maturity mismatch. I use an extended version of the well-known Diamond \u0026 Dybvig model by introducing short term borrowing where the future cost of borrowing is unknown. This creates an additional source of maturity mismatch and the demand deposit contracts are now vulnerable to both depositor and lender panics. The key is when the borrowing and investment decisions are made the total cost of borrowing is unknown but the deposit contract can be written contingent on this cost. This creates different consumption paths for patient and impatient agents and they bear different degrees of interest rate risk. The characterization of the contract shows interest risk is mainly borne by early consumers particularly for higher roll over costs. In times of crisis the most liquid funds are the ones that are used first and hence consumers who need urgent liquidity suffers most. The main contribution of this part is that, it combines a bank run model with aggregate uncertainty with short-term borrowing. It also sheds some light on the dynamics of financial problems in developing countries. \n    The last chapter analyzes risk sharing under private banking. Once again a version of Diamond \u0026 Dybvig framework is used. Instead of assuming a banking structure where consumers form a union to achieve optimal risk sharing, I consider a private bank that maximizes profits. I analyze the deposit contract under different assumptions about how the bank and the depositors consider the probability of a bank run. The original Diamond \u0026 Dybvig model, implicitly assumes the probability of a bank-run is sufficiently small to ensure participation. With a private bank, I allow partial participation and optimizing depositors automatically establish individual rationality. This leads to a supply of deposits (or demand for risk sharing function) which varies along with the payments offered in the contract. Therefore, the bank faces a trade-off between the rates it offer and the amount of deposits it can attract. This basically leads a new set of equilibrium contracts to come out which are not possible under standard risk sharing. Depending on the risk averseness of the consumers these alternative contracts produce different levels of financial fragility. This last chapter contributes to the literature by considering the possible risk sharing contracts under a profit maximizing monopolistic commercial bank. It also briefly discusses how this may effect financial fragility.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yavuz, Devrim","Chakravarty, Surajeet"],"dc:date":"2010-09-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108688,"sim:weight":0.405313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108296,"sim:weight":0.383872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108782,"sim:weight":0.365773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108333,"sim:weight":0.359544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85709,"sim:weight":0.323098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109009,"sim:weight":0.307768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108940,"sim:weight":0.288899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85823,"sim:weight":0.286831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.27666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85832,"sim:weight":0.274541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Chapter 1 seeks to provide an exhaustive literature review of those works of the proponents of Original Grace in which they discuss the doctrine in order to demonstrate the place of Original Grace within each tradition, and to make specific connections from the ideas of each writer to their respective theological, philosophical, and historical influences.  Chapter 2 explores the exegetical basis for the doctrine of Original Grace.

I seek, primarily, to delve deeply into the text to gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which the doctrine of Original Grace has been extracted from this text, explore the most detailed textual justification that has been provided for the doctrine, and ultimately determine what is at stake in the unique reading of the text that brings out Original Grace.  Secondarily, I seek to assess whether the Original Grace interpretation of the passage is successful on its own terms.  Chapter 3 aims to make a significant contribution to Stone-Campbell Movement theology, and also contribute to wider contemporary theological conversations from within the Stone-Campbell Movement.  Specifically, I seek to discover how the doctrine of Original Grace fares in conversation with other accounts of grace and salvation, both as a potential contribution, and by running the gauntlet of critique within that conversation.  The chapter makes this contribution by discussing the theological and practical implications of Original Grace, identifying and analyzing both the doctrine’s theological strengths and weaknesses, describing and evaluating the theological contribution of the doctrine of Original Grace in regard to the three most critical exegetical issues, and assessing the viability of Original Grace as part of the traditional and contemporary Stone-Campbell soteriological system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Smith, Brian","Higton, Mike"],"dc:date":"2010-11-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This study is the first of two which explores and compares the Nfer-Nelson Emotional Literacy scale (Faupel, 2003) scores reported in the manual with those found in an Irish sample with a view to demonstrating its appropriateness as a cross cultural measure of EL. The three part scale comprise student (N\u003d188), teacher (N\u003d163) and parent (N\u003d175) scales. The scales were completed in schools with a disadvantaged (74% of sample) or non-disadvantaged status (26%). Irish scores were organised into categories using percentile ranges to allow for comparative analysis with the original UK sample. Overall patterns of scores were similar but the cut off point for children in need of intervention was higher in the Irish sample. Within sample differences were explored using t-tests and children from disadvantaged backgrounds rated themselves with statistically lower EL than their non-disadvantaged counterparts. Inter-correlations were run to explore the relationships between and within the three scales. A mixed pattern of correlations was found and some evidence supporting Goleman’s construct of EL came from strong consistent relationships (correlation range 0.41-0.77) between the empathy and self-regulation subscales in the three scales. Differences between teacher scores suggests cultural differences in perception of EL and strong relationships between parent and student scales suggests a qualitatively stronger understanding of emotions shared between Irish children and parents compared with their counterparts in the UK. A major limitation of this study is that the Irish sample was largely disadvantaged (74%), whereas the UK sample was nationally representative.\n\nAbstract (paper 2/2)\n\nThis is the second of two papers which explores and compares the Nfer-Nelson Emotional Literacy scale in an Irish context. Emotional Literacy (EL) Scores obtained in paper one are used to explore the reliability (Study 1) and predictive validity (study 2) of the tripartite Nfer-Nelson scale. This scale is comprised of parent, teacher and student scales. Reliability is established, using internal consistency measures for the Total EL for all three scales (α range 0.77-0.92) and also for the majority of component subscales in the teacher scale (α range 0.77-0.88). The children (n\u003d 153) who completed the student scale for paper one were assessed for their academic achievement using a reading attainment test, the Mary Immaculate College Reading Attainment Test (MICRA-T) and also for  self esteem using  The Culture Fair Self Esteem Inventory (CFSEI). Bivariate regression analysis indicated that academic achievement is predicted by the majority of the components (r range 0.247-0.329) comprising EL and the Total EL (r\u003d0.314) from the teacher scale. Self esteem is predicted by all the components (r range 0.212-0.272) and the Total EL (r\u003d0.285) from the teacher scale and the majority of components (r range 0.2-0.361) and the Total EL (r\u003d 0.384) from the student scale. The items which constitute the scales were investigated and overlaps between the: self-awareness subscale and self esteem items as well as: motivation subscale and aspects of academic achievement bring the discreteness of the associated EL subscales into question. Statistical findings suggest the cross cultural use of the Nfer-Nelson scale. However, difficulties with the face validity of the scale items question the appropriateness of the items used to assess the EL construct. These findings suggest the EL construct to be otherwise acceptable","bibo:AuthorList":["Flynn, Sara Jane","Tunbridge, Margie","Macleod, Flora"],"dc:date":"2010-05-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Rappemonad sequences were amplified from aquatic environmental DNA samples collected from a wide variety of marine and freshwater sites suggests the rappemonads display a broad ecophysiology and wide geographical habitat distribution. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on rappemonad rDNA sequences. Firstly, analyzing plastid SSU rDNA sequences suggesting this group form a diverse, strongly supported monophyletic clade encompassing numerous subclades. Secondly, phylogenetic analysis of a near full-length plastid rDNA gene cluster suggests the rappemonads represent an evolutionarily distinct lineage branching within the cryptomonad/haptophyte radiation, specifically as a sister group to the haptophytes. This suggests that the rappemonad plastid shares common ancestry with the red algal derived secondary plastids of the haptophytes and cryptomonads. Consequently, rappemonad plastid sequences appear to represent the plastid of either a novel highly divergent haptophyte or of an entirely new group. Phylogenetic comparisons suggest that the rappemonad lineage is not representative of the plastid of the biliphytes, a recently discovered microbial eukaryote. The biliphytes have been shown to display a weakly supported relationship with the cryptomonads in nuclear 18S SSU rDNA phylogenies although our analysis based on nuclear-encoded SSU and LSU rRNA genes does not support a biliphyte/cryptomonad relationship. Analyses using qPCR methodology demonstrate that the rappemonads can form transient blooms in the Sargasso Sea. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed rappemonad cells were 6.6 ± 1.2 x 5.7 ± 1.0 µm, and appear to contain 2 to 4 plastids. We have shown the rappemonads to be a novel, widespread, microbial algae and potentially an important component in global photosynthetic ecosystems and therefore likely a player in oceanic geochemical cycles.

For some parameters, such as peak oxygen uptake, the influence of training status remains controversial whilst for other parameters, such as oxygen uptake kinetics, the influence of training status remains simply uninvestigated in young girls. Despite this lack of empirical evidence, it has been suggested for some time now that children may lack trainability and that this may be related to the presence of a maturational threshold below which significant adaptations to training cannot occur. This suggestion requires investigation, not least because the findings of some studies which appear to support this contention may in reality be a reflection of the use of an inappropriate test modality for the investigation of training status influences. The purpose of this thesis was therefore to determine the physiological trainability of girls at different stages of maturation and to investigate the interaction between training status, maturity and exercise modality. To achieve this purpose a series of 5 studies was completed, in which trained and untrained girls completed ramp incremental exercise, constant-work-rate exercise and Wingate exercise on two exercise modalities, one upper (arm crank) and one lower body (cycle). During these tests, cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic and mechanical power parameters were assessed. In response to ramp incremental exercise, trained girls were shown to have a higher peak  O2, SV and   at all stages of maturity, along with an altered SV and fractional muscle oxygen extraction pattern, irrespective of exercise modality. The importance of exercise modality was evident during heavy intensity constant-work-rate exercise in pre-pubertal girls, where training status was only associated with significant influences on  O2 kinetics (faster phase II time constant in trained girls) during upper body ergometry. In contrast, pubertal trained girls had faster  O2 kinetics during both exercise modalities, an influence which may suggest both central and peripheral adaptations to the delivery and utilisation of oxygen. Exercise modality was also revealed to be an important factor in the demonstration of training status influences during a 30 s Wingate test, with trained girls at all stages of maturity exhibiting higher mechanical power indices during upper body ergometry only. An influence of training status was also evident in the lower fatigue index found in the trained girls at all stages of maturity during both modalities, but no influence was found in the oxidative contribution to the Wingate test. None of these studies revealed an influence of maturity status in determining the magnitude of training status effects. Overall, the 5 studies encompassed within this thesis demonstrate that children are trainable and that this is not moderated by maturity.","bibo:AuthorList":["McNarry, Melitta Anne","Jones, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2010-10-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

There has been a tendency in film criticism to view these strong women as ‘figuratively male’ and therefore not ‘really’ women, which, I argue, is largely due to a reliance on the psychoanalytic paradigms that have dominated feminist film theory since its beginnings. Building on Elisabeth Hills’s work on the character of Ellen Ripley of the Alien series, I explore how notions of ‘becoming’ and the ‘Body without Organs’ proposed by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari can be activated to provide a more positive set of readings of active women on screen. These readings are not limited by discussions of sex or gender, but discuss the body in terms of its increased capacities as it interacts with the world around it. I do not argue for a Deleuzian analysis of cinema as such, because this project is concerned with aspects of representation which did not form part of Deleuze’s philosophy of cinema. Rather I use Deleuze and Guattari’s work to explore alternative ways of reading the active women these franchises present and the benefits they afford. Through these explorations I demonstrate, however, that applying the Deleuzoguattarian ‘method’ is a potentially risky undertaking for feminist theory. Deconstructing notions of ‘being’ and ‘identity’ through the project of becoming may have benefits in terms of addressing ‘woman’ beyond binaristic thought, but it may also have negative consequences. What may be liberating for feminist film theory may be also be destructive. This is because through becoming we destabilise a position from which to address potentially ideologically unsound treatments of women on screen.","bibo:AuthorList":["Green, Caroline Ann","Neale, Steve"],"dc:date":"2010-04-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The central thesis considered is the unique nature of the Tribunal as embodying elements of both conflict and cooperation at a time of considerable and ongoing hostility between Iran and the United States over various issues. Iran and America, following World War II, set up a unique relationship. This close cooperation resulted in antagonism after the Islamic Revolution in 1979; the American diplomats were taken hostage, and a number of multi-billion dollar contracts and transactions were terminated. Several avenues were sought to resolve the problem. Finally, the Algerian government stepped in as an intermediary to resolve the issue. Iran and the United States agreed to establish the Tribunal in 1981. The level of confrontation between Tehran and Washington was so strong that the Tribunal suspended its operation for months. The Tribunal not only managed to survive, but it also made it possible; as a safe haven, as a legitimate forum and as a joint embassy for the parties, to extend their day-to-day cooperation for almost thirty years. \nHow and under what conditions have Iran and America, labelled by each other as the \"Axis of Evil\" and the \"Great Satan\" been able to cooperate in the absence of diplomatic relations?  How do the Agents of an allegedly \"World-devouring America\" and the \"Terrorist sponsoring Iran\"  meet face to face in an institution which itself is the product of severe enmity?  All such questions could be answered by the unique nature of the Tribunal: its decisions are based upon \"political exigency\" and cultural expediency \"rather than legal foundations.\" Two simultaneous forces of conflict and cooperation have been in process: at a time when the American navy was raiding the Iranian oil platform in the Persian Gulf, a big case amounting to billions of dollars was being negotiated at the Tribunal forum through an out-of court settlement process.  At the time when this dissertation is produced, the same contending forces of discord and collaboration are in operation: on the one hand there exists Iran-US nuclear standoff on the international level, and on the other hand certain multi-billion dollar oil and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) are decided at the Tribunal. \nThe Tribunal premises have been used as a forum for \"deliberation\" on major legal and political disputes. It has been both praised and blackballed. At one extreme, it has been regarded as \"a gold mine of information\" and at the other extreme its rulings are not considered to be applicable in other financial disputes because of the \"political compromise within the Tribunal.\" Iran and America have found it necessary, under the condition of uncertainty, to make concessions to ensure the integrity of the Tribunal and the latter in turn has equipped itself with a proper strategy of survival by establishing its own rules and procedures. Around four thousand cases have been brought before the Tribunal, with each case involving various conflicts of interest. In all of those issues, the forces of cooperation have prevailed. By resolving those cases, the Tribunal has achieved its fundamental objectives: conflict resolution by peaceful means. The Tribunal will cease to exist only when Iran and America open diplomatic relations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moradi, Maryam","Armstrong, David J."],"dc:date":"2010-03-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In Western intellectual, political and imperialist discourse the global present of constitutions represents a proliferation of superior practices and universal values born uniquely of European thought and culture. This thesis proposes that constitutions derive their universal truths and their powers not from this (a)historical centre, but in contingent relation to the beliefs, experiences, exigencies and aspirations of the cultures they address and form (as the People). Constitutions function in this respect as rhetorical argumentation. As culturally informed, constitutional history embodies a dynamic, contested and uneven space of relationships not explicated by a linear evolution. Thus, I propose an interwoven and unpredictably circulating world space of knowledge continually shifting its shape throughout the modern era. These propositions are explored through four constitutional texts. Chapter 2 is a genealogy of “the People” in the US Constitution(s), concentrating on the constitutional sanction of slavery, the abolition amendments and civil rights court cases. Chapter 3 elucidates the interrelationship between the declaration of enlightened autonomy in the 1827 Cherokee Constitution and the consequent re-writing of US constitutional law and history required to disguise avarice beneath moral superiority. Chapter 4 considers the constitutions of Vietnam and the creation of a national People as inseparable from struggles against external forces. Chapter 5, on the 2004 Interim Constitution of Iraq, examines the Western creation of an abstract “Iraqi People,” kept distinct from the divisions and aspirations of actual peoples. As read texts and as cultural objects constitutions exist in multitudinous, simultaneous, social, legal, political and intellectual realms of interpretation and perceived value. The interdisciplinary approach taken here is therefore essential and demanded. I conclude that the struggle of human communities has brought progress in world constitutionalism; power reluctantly accommodates the expectations of those that sustain it.","bibo:AuthorList":["Salt, Matthew Scott","Gagnier, Regenia"],"dc:date":"2010-09-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A key aim of the research was to investigate the extent to which faith may impact upon the delivery of HRE. For the purposes of comparison, one faith school and one secular school were sampled in each country. In each school, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with the curriculum coordinator and teachers responsible for delivering HRE and questionnaire surveys and focus group interviews were carried out with students in Years 8 and 9.  Data were gathered in relation to: the nature and positioning of human rights education in each school; teachers’ levels of confidence in delivering HRE and their pedagogical strategies; and the students’ knowledge of human rights principles and the extent to which this knowledge shaped their attitudes and behaviour.   \n\nFindings from this study indicate that the teaching of human rights education is addressed differently in schools, depending on their staffing, curriculum priorities and religious status. In the English faith school, HRE was taught within the RE curriculum and was seen as a means to teach about Christianity; in the secular school, the emphasis was on human rights as universal values, delivered through the Citizenship curriculum.  In both schools in Malaysia, where Islamic principles strongly underpin the national curriculum, human rights education was delivered as part of the Civics and Citizenship curriculum, but taught by RE teachers. Common concerns amongst teachers in both countries and both types of school related to appropriate training, sufficient curriculum time and confidence to teach about controversial issues. While there were school-level factors influencing delivery, these could not be disassociated from the wider socio-cultural, political and educational policy contexts.\n\nThe findings in relation to students’ knowledge and practice of human rights also reflected the different contexts of each school and country. The key influences appeared less to do with religion (in that this did not appear to be a key factor in the differing responses from the two English schools) than with cultural, social and economic factors, though Islam underpins these in Malaysia. In general, English students had a deeper understanding of human rights but there was some dislocation between understanding and actual attitudes and behaviour. In Malaysia, a much newer democracy, levels of understanding about human rights were somewhat lower but there were many issues on which English and Malaysian students expressed similar views. The most noticeable exception was in relation to respect for individuals regardless of their sexuality.\n\nThis was a small study and it is therefore not possible to generalise from its findings. However, it has raised some important issues about the teaching of HRE in both England and Malaysia. In both countries there needs to be further consideration of where in the curriculum HRE is best positioned, in order to ensure that it receives sufficient curriculum time and resources. More and better targeted in-service education is required to support teachers of human rights, with particular emphasis on the pedagogy of teaching controversial issues. In both countries it is important that teachers and students work together on understanding and practising the principles underpinning human rights.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nordin, Zaimuariffudin Shukri Bin","Holden, Cathie","Haynes, Gill"],"dc:date":"2010-04-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Lewis and Ivone Gebara","bibo:abstract":"This dissertation explores theologies of suffering through engagement with five theologians from across fifteen centuries of the Christian tradition: Gregory the Great, Julian of Norwich, Jeremy Taylor, C.S. Lewis and Ivone Gebara. It uses a typological method to examine the types of responses that are advocated by each theologian, and the relation of their responses to five theological touchstones: Humanity, Sin and Evil; God’s Providence; Salvation; Christ; and Eternal Life.  The Introductory Chapter provides an exploration of the definitions and etymologies of suffering and grief; a description of the typological method; an examination of notable relevant literature; and an introduction to the five thinkers.  Chapter One is an examination of the life and writings of the 6th century pope Gregory the Great, with particular focus on The Book of the Pastoral Rule and Moralia. Gregory understands suffering to be a discipline sent by God to the faithful.  Chapter Two is an examination of the life and Revelations text of the 13th century English mystic Julian of Norwich, who focuses on the reward God desires to give those who suffer.  Chapter Three is an examination of the life and writings of 17th century Anglican bishop Jeremy Taylor, with particular focus on Holy Living and Holy Dying. Taylor places an emphasis on the lifelong practice of faithfulness in preparation for death.  Chapter Four is an examination of the life and writings of 20th century Anglican theologian and author C. S. Lewis, with particular attention to The Problem of Pain, The Chronicles of Narnia, A Grief Observed, and Letters to Malcom.  Lewis offers the example of one who is willing to engage with the depth of his grief and to question God on his road to acceptance.  Chapter Five is an examination of the life and writings of contemporary Brazilian, feminist and liberation theologian Ivone Gebara, with particular focus on her book Out of the Depths and her engagement with Latin American author Isabel Allende.  Gebara questions traditional understandings of suffering, as well as when suffering is to be accepted and when suffering is unjust and should be combated.  The Concluding Chapter constructs a contemporary theology of suffering drawing on the insights and wrestling with the challenges raised by the varying perspectives of the five theologians.  The goal is to provide a hopeful and nuanced way of thinking theologically about suffering for contemporary Christians.  The contemporary theology affirms the importance of the call, found in Gebara, to combat unjust suffering through acts of love and mercy, while also affirming that acceptance of the reality of endemic suffering, found in all five theologians, can provide  one with opportunities to grow spiritually, live more faithfully and to experience the blessings in the midst of suffering that are a foretaste of heavenly bliss.","bibo:AuthorList":["James, Molly","Higton, Mike","Cobb, Kelton"],"dc:date":"2010-09-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Despite this, little scientific evidence currently exists to ascertain the mechanisms behind performance failure in this task and/or the efficacy of training designed to improve penalty shooting. In a football penalty kick it has been reported that the majority of kickers do not look to the area they wish to place the ball; preferring to focus on the ‘keeper and predict anticipatory movements before shooting. Such a strategy seems counterproductive and contradictory to current research findings regarding visually guided aiming. Coordination of eye and limb movements has been shown to be essential for the production of accurate motor responses. A disruption to this coordination not only seems to negatively affect performance, but subsequent motor responses seem to follow direction of gaze. Thus, where the eyes lead actions tend to follow. In study 1, ten participants were asked to kick a standard sized football to alternate corners of a goal, whilst looking centrally and whilst looking where they intended to hit. This disruption of eye-limb coordination brought about a 15% reduction in kicking accuracy. When participants were asked to fixate centrally, their shots hit more centrally (17cm) than when they were allowed to look where they intended to hit. These results were in spite of no significant differences between the number of missed shots, preparation time and ball speed data across conditions. We concluded that centrally focused fixations dragged resultant motor actions inwards towards more central target locations. Put simply, where the eyes looked shots tended to follow. The second study sought to test the predictions of attentional control theory (ACT) in a sporting environment in order to establish how anxiety affects performance in penalty kicks. Fourteen experienced footballers took penalty kicks under low- and high-threat counterbalanced conditions while wearing a gaze registration system. Fixations to target locations (goalkeeper and goal area) were determined using frame-by-frame analysis. When anxious, footballers made faster first fixations and fixated for significantly longer toward the goalkeeper. This disruption in gaze behaviour brought about significant reductions in shooting accuracy, with shots becoming significantly centralized and within the goalkeeper’s reach. These findings support the predictions of ACT, as anxious participants were more likely to focus on the “threatening” goalkeeper, owing to an increased influence of the stimulus-driven attentional control system. A further prediction of ACT is that when anxious, performers are more likely to be distracted, particularly if the distracter is threat related. When facing penalty kicks in football (soccer), goalkeepers frequently incorporate strategies that are designed to distract the kicker. However, no direct empirical evidence exists to ascertain what effect such visual distractions have on the attentional control, and performance, of footballers. In the third study, eighteen experienced footballers took five penalty kicks under counterbalanced conditions of threat (low vs. high) and goalkeeper movement (stationary vs. waving arms) while wearing eye-tracking equipment. Results suggested that participants were more distracted by a moving goalkeeper than a stationary one and struggled to disengage from a moving goalkeeper under situations of high threat. Significantly more penalties were saved on trials when the goalkeeper was moving and shots were also generally hit closer to the goalkeeper (centrally) on these trials. The results provide partial support for the predictions of attentional control theory and implications for kickers and goalkeepers are discussed. The previous studies showed that anxiety can disrupt visual attention, visuomotor control and subsequent shot location in penalty kicks. However, optimal visual attention has been trained in other far aiming skills, improving performance and resistance to pressure. In study 4, we therefore asked a team of ten university soccer players to follow a quiet eye (QE; Vickers, 1996) training program, designed to align gaze with aiming intention to optimal scoring zones, over a seven week period. Performance and gaze parameters were compared to a placebo group (ten players) who received no instruction, but practiced the same number of penalty kicks over the same time frame. Results from a retention test indicated that the QE trained group had more effective visual attentional control; were significantly more accurate; and had 50% fewer shots saved by the goalkeeper than the placebo group. Both groups then competed in a penalty shootout to explore the influence of anxiety on attentional control and shooting accuracy. Under the pressure of the shootout the QE trained group failed to maintain their accuracy advantage, despite maintaining more distal aiming fixations of longer duration. The results therefore provide only partial support for the effectiveness of brief QE training interventions for experienced performers. This series of studies are the first to explore the gaze behaviour of football penalty takers in a quest to uncover and understand anxiety’s negative influence on attentional control and performance. They are also the first to explore the efficacy of goalkeeper distractions and training in improving performance from both the goalkeeper’s and kicker’s perspective. The results of these studies conclude that when anxious, penalty takers show an attentional bias toward the ‘threatening’ goalkeeper that can be increased and utilised by a goalkeeper employing distraction techniques and that penalty takers do benefit, to some extent, from a gaze-based pre-shot routine","bibo:AuthorList":["Wood, Greg","Wilson, Mark"],"dc:date":"2010-11-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Research has identified the development of social and emotional skills as key to a child’s future well being. Using a social constructionist perspective (Vygotsky, 1978; Rogoff, 1990), this project aimed to identify how pre-schools develop children’s social competence. Twenty-one children were observed in their free choice time at pre-school. Systematic observations recorded child-to-child activity and naturalistic observations recorded the children’s interactions with the adults present. Semi-structured interviews took place with the managers of the pre-schools. There were distinct beliefs amongst the pre-schools about how children’s social competence should be promoted. The observations revealed that the pre-school children were ‘sociable’ either by attaching to an adult or a peer. Adults were also communicative with the children within the ‘free choice’ periods but this was characterised by brief interactions with a broad content of making a request, ensuring a health and safety criteria was met rather than in sustained communication about play. It was concluded that pre-school practitioners may benefit from better targeted training to develop their skills in facilitating children’s social competence within play and that parental input could play a part in developing this.  \n\nPaper 2\nA case study of four children’s social competence during their transition from pre-school to Primary school\nAbstract\nThis study undertook an examination of four children’s social competences during a period of 18 months while they experienced the transition from pre-school to Primary school. Transition has been described as a time of ‘discontinuity’ (Margetts, 2002). Using Bronfennbrenner’s (1979) ecological framework, there was a focus on the interactions of the child during transition as well as on the school level of influence. The data was explored using a case study approach; the play experiences of four children were recorded using two types of observation (both systematic and naturalistic), semi-structured interviews with pre-school and school staff were conducted and questionnaire data using the Social Competence Behaviour Evaluation, Pre-school edition (LaFreniere and Dumas, 2003) was taken from parents and teachers. In this study, schools had differing approaches to transition and there were found to be gaps in the transition process for children who had had no prior contact with the school. Social competence did not change over transition, except for a dramatic decrease in parent scores for two children. It was argued that children may benefit from more individualised approaches during transition and also better communication between pre-school settings and Primary schools.","bibo:AuthorList":["Elkins, Julie Ann","Norwich, Brahm"],"dc:date":"2011-02-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

There has been extensive research undertaken to better understand how motivation and confidence affect EFL/ESL learners, yet little attention has been paid to a more recent area of educational research in emotional intelligence (EI) and how self-coaching may also contribute to a tertiary EFL/ESL learners’ ability to succeed.  It is not unreasonable to hypothesize that everyday occurrences encountered in their personal and academic life may very well, at times, have a detrimental effect on students’ confidence and motivation, and therefore impede their ability to reach set goals.  This study explores the possible correlations between the three main constructs, confidence, motivation and EI while investigating female Emirati tertiary EFL students at Zayed University in the U.A.E. and their interest towards self-coaching to reach their academic and personal goals.\n\n\tThis exploratory longitudinal interpretive study used a mixed-method approach to gather data  generated  from a survey (CMEII)  constructed and piloted for this study and completed by 199 female Emirati tertiary EFL participants measuring motivation, confidence and EI.  In addition, student journals, interviews and progress reports retrieved from CMEI workshops also informed the research questions pertaining to these aforementioned constructs.\n\n\tResults suggest that there is a correlation between confidence, motivation and EI. These results would indicate that  when the level of motivation increases, so does the level of confidence in speaking English. Motivation to self-direct in English is positively correlated with problem solving, higher life-satisfaction and confidence levels.  Surprisingly the higher the academic anxiety, the more students want to self-direct.  Furthermore it was found that students participating in this study found self-coaching methods extremely helpful in supporting them in reaching both their personal and academic goals.    \n\n\tThe implications of this exploratory study into confidence, motivation and emotional intelligence has laid the foundation for future research in this area.  By creating and piloting the first Confidence, Motivation and Emotional Intelligence survey instrument (CMEII) designed for the ESL/EFL learning environment, a primary obstacle has been traversed.  The CMEII  research instrument and results of this study will no doubt help bring light and understanding  to how self-coaching and self-direction can support  female EFL students in reaching their personal and academic goals in the U.A.E and abroad.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anderson, Marianne","Riley, Susan"],"dc:date":"2010-10-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

They capture spatial relationships between variables, but ignore any temporal relationships that might exist between observations.  Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) and Probabilistic CCA (ProbCCA) are versions of these two models that explain the statistical properties of the observed variables as linear mixtures of an alternative, hypothetical set of hidden, or latent, variables and explicitly model noise.  Both the noise and the latent variables are assumed to be Gaussian distributed.\n\nThis thesis introduces two new models, named PPCA-AR and ProbCCA-AR, that augment PPCA and ProbCCA respectively with autoregressive processes over the latent variables to additionally capture temporal relationships between the observations.  To make PPCA-AR and ProbCCA-AR robust to outliers and able to model leptokurtic data, the Gaussian assumptions are replaced with infinite scale mixtures of Gaussians, using the Student-t distribution.\n\nBayesian inference calculates posterior probability distributions for each of the parameter variables, from which we obtain a measure of confidence in the inference.  It avoids the pitfalls associated with the maximum likelihood method: integrating over all possible values of the parameter variables guards against overfitting.  For these new models the integrals required for exact Bayesian inference are intractable; instead a method of approximation, the variational Bayesian approach, is used.  This enables the use of automatic relevance determination to estimate the model orders.\n\nPPCA-AR and ProbCCA-AR can be viewed as linear dynamical systems, so the forward-backward algorithm, also known as the Baum-Welch algorithm, is used as an efficient method for inferring the posterior distributions of the latent variables.  The exact algorithm is tractable because Gaussian assumptions are made regarding the distribution of the latent variables.  This thesis introduces a variational Bayesian forward-backward algorithm based on Student-t assumptions.\n\nThe new models are demonstrated on synthetic datasets and on real remote sensing and EEG data.","bibo:AuthorList":["Christmas, Jacqueline Tania","Everson, Richard"],"dc:date":"2011-01-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Small states in this study are defined in power terms. But the study also focuses on small states in a property sense--those with few diversification options, making the services sector potentially an important avenue for economic growth and diversification.  \n\nThe study seeks to examine critically the parameters that GATS places on policy-making of small states--whether governments are limited to providing a competitive business environment, or if they retain sufficient policy space to shape the development of a sector. The study also looks at the interplay between international and domestic factors in development of policy.\n\nThe tourism industries of Oman and Qatar provide case studies to examine these issues. Tourism has the potential to contribute to the economies of small states generally, but debate exists as to whether GATS leaves small states with sufficient space to influence the direction of this sector. The similarities between Oman and Qatar in both power and property terms allow for a comparative examination of whether small states can find meaningful policy space. In addition, their domestic dynamics provide insight into the interplay between domestic and international pressures on policy choices. \n\nThe experiences of Oman and Qatar suggest that there remains some policy space for states to develop their tourism industries in a manner compatible with local aspirations. Governments thus have some scope to direct the shape of the tourism sector beyond merely providing a competitive business environment. But policy direction is influenced by capacity, past experiences and existing norms, and these differences can result in varying outcomes. Additionally, small states must decide their priorities in on-going WTO negotiations in order to maintain existing policy space.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turner, Angeline Biegler","Stanley, Bruce"],"dc:date":"2010-08-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In doing so it not only investigates the diagnosis and definition of mental illnesses, it also raises questions about the interface between conventional and alternative medicine. Using a variety of printed sources, including popular media articles, scientific and medical journal publications, and St. John’s wort self-help books, a number of historical themes are explored. \nThis thesis takes issue with existing medical historical studies of depression. Firstly it is argued that they have presented progressive depression histories. Secondly, it is suggested that they have retrospectively diagnosed depression on the basis of similar symptoms. It is therefore argued that illness is specific to the time in which it exists and should be understood within its own historical timeframe. \nDuring the 1990s standardised St. John’s wort was promoted as a natural and safe remedy. Adverts and media reports also highlighted the fact that it had a long medical history. Although this thesis establishes that the plant has been traditionally used to treat physical illnesses, it seems that a growing distrust of conventional antidepressants, combined with an established interest in alternative medicine, encouraged some lay people to use the remedy to treat mild mood disorders. \nIt is further argued that lay people have a history of self-treating minor mental illnesses using preparatory and OTC remedies such as preparatory nerve tonics. Not only did lay people desire autonomous treatments, it also seems that standardised St. John’s wort provided a functional role as an OTC remedy. By the 1990s the concepts of responsible self-care and self-treatment were being actively encouraged by medical authorities. Therefore this thesis reclassifies the passive mild to moderately depressed patient as an active consumer.\nFollowing an analysis of the popular media it is suggested that the 1990s coverage of depression and its treatments was confusing. Indeed, depression and its treatment with conventional medicines and St. John’s wort were sometimes presented as part of a wider life style choice. Finally, it is argued that by the 1990s standardised St. John’s wort received the same scientific and medical scrutiny as conventional medicines. It is therefore suggested that the remedy represents a situation in which the boundaries between conventional and alternative medicines have become increasingly indistinguishable.","bibo:AuthorList":["Songhurst, Leah","Jackson, Mark"],"dc:date":"2010-09-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This is argued in three sections. First I consider the history of money and in particular of the commodity theory of money. Second I consider the issues of debt and interest, of central concern in the Christian Scriptures. Finally I consider money through four different lenses:  justice, value, desire and power. The argument as a whole leads up to the last of these. As was already suggested by Jacques Ellul fifty years ago, I argue that money must be understood as  a cosmic power to which we are all subject and which is in need of redemption.

Within reflective practice, action research has developed as an approach within which teachers can systematically question, challenge and improve their teaching and recently been introduced into teacher education programmes with the rationale of encouraging student teachers to critically engage with curriculum and practice (Mills, 2003).  Recent years have additionally seen interest in how teachers’ knowledge is sociodiscursively constructed with a concomitant focus on the link between teacher identity and practice (e.g. Danielewicz, 2001; Miller Marsh, 2003; Norton 2000).  However, few studies have attempted to explore the influence action research may have on the construction of student teacher practice and identity (Trent, 2010).  This study explores the role of an undergraduate action research project in terms of the extent of its influence on the development of student practice in English Language classes and the trajectory of their emergent teacher identities.  Informed by new theoretical directions in ethnography (Denzin, 1997), data was collected using naturally occurring texts integral to the student teachers’ studies, including weekly lesson observations, post-observation feedback discussions and three focus group discussions over the course of the research project. Analysis indicates that the undergraduate action research project differentially affects students’ practice and emergent identities, but that this relationship may be tangential and students’ agency may be overshadowed by methodological preoccupations and constraints of institutions. Both global and local discursive formations combine and interact to influence this process which occurs in a theoretical ‘interzone’ a third space, sociodiscursively constructed between institutions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hunt, Neil David","Skinner, Nigel","Riley, Susan"],"dc:date":"2010-10-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Particular emphasis is placed on: participants’ experiences, achievements and opinions about the programmes; their understanding of rural poverty; the extent to which they thought that the programmes should have had poverty alleviation as an aim, and to which they believed that the programmes had helped to identify and address rural poverty.\nA review of the literature relating to rural policy reveals that political interest (and, therefore, policymakers’ interest) in the functions of England’s country – “market” - towns, and their place in the settlement hierarchy, has waxed and waned since the Second World War.  During this period the nature of government, in particular the balance between the various tiers, has tilted in favour of central government.  Consequently, the powers available to County and District/Borough Councils, if not Town/Parish Councils, have reduced.  Central government has increasingly looked to partnerships formed from public, voluntary, and private sector organizations to implement policy.  It is governance, therefore, rather than government, that has grown in importance in recent years.  The MTI/BT programmes were both designed for implementation by broad-based partnerships of professionals and volunteers.\nThe literature also reveals that the post-war period has seen research into  poverty become increasingly nuanced and sophisticated, with definitions moving away from the relatively simple to understand (eg lack of money) to more complicated notions of disadvantage, deprivation, and social exclusion.  The factors that affect rural poverty have, since the 1970s, been remarkably constant (eg access to services, affordable housing, low income self-employment).  The problems of rural poverty have not been solved. \nIt is argued, based on the results of the data acquired from this research, that community-led development programmes such as the MTI/BTP, have the potential to inform the development of policy and practice relating to community-led development and poverty alleviation, to add to the body of knowledge about rural poverty, and to improve the overall understanding of the functions of England’s small towns.  Despite the potential of partnerships to effect change, the important role of local authorities as democratically accountable organizations, and contributors to partnerships’ success and effectiveness, is noted.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morris, Gordon Ralph","Winter, Michael","Lobley, Matt"],"dc:date":"2010-06-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The research may contribute to the body of knowledge and the practice of art education in Greece, and possibly inform future curriculum development in the subject. \n\nIn Greece, since 1985, the development of art education and pupils’ aesthetic understanding has been one of the five fundamental aims for secondary and primary education. To improve art education at the primary and secondary level, the Greek Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs has undertaken several initiatives. One such initiative has been the development of specialist arts schools. These alternative specialist schools exist in several European countries. In 2003 the Greek Ministry of Education announced the establishment of the first arts school of the country. The year the research was conducted 2008-2009, three arts schools were operated in Greece. \n\nThe research endeavoured to understand issues related to the learning process in one of the new specialist arts schools, as perceived by third year pupils (aged fourteen and fifteen years old) and their visual art teachers. The research used the interpretive research paradigm, as it is the most suitable method to explore the socio-cultural reality in which the pupils and teachers are situated. Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews, observations, and focus groups. The analysis of findings revealed a learning experience very closely related with the philosophy and the content of the Greece’s national curriculum of visual art. However, according to the findings of this study further attention needs to be given to the issue of developing imaginative thinking, within the framework of the art curriculum. The study proposes an alternative version of the art curriculum, with a view to facilitating imaginative thinking, in the art curriculum of specialist arts schools in Greece as well as the teaching of art in normal secondary schools. \nIt is hoped that the results of the study will offer ground for discussions and oppositions in the area of art education in Greece, in which area not much research has been undertaken. The study’s proposal for the revisions to the existing art curriculum for the specialist arts schools, as they are resulted from evidences embedded in pupils and teachers views, stress on the significance and the originality of the findings and for this reason it is hoped to concern the writing aspect of Greece’s future curriculum writers. This will add to the development of art education in Greece and further will foster relationships between the members of the particular school where the research was carried out.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tsimboukidou, Irene","Craft, Anna","Cunliffe, Leslie"],"dc:date":"2010-09-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Teachers are arguably the professional group most likely to experience pathological stress and burnout as a result of working long hours. Research in schools suggests that teachers’ work orientations are strongly influenced by factors of personal identity, social background, career stage and personal resilience to stress. In Further Education (FE) research hitherto has emphasised the impact of Government policy and managerial style on teacher behaviour, and notions of teacher professionalism. There has been less research into the impact of FE teacher identities and attitudes towards work upon their working lives. This thesis investigates the relatively under-researched area of work culture within a single FE College, in an attempt to discover the reasons underlying teacher’s reactions to the pressures of overwork. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were carried out with 13 teachers and managers to investigate teacher responses to the work culture of the College. Based upon existing theoretical models of stress and burnout, three groups of potential determinants are explored: personal identity, the social context of the College, and the impact of external political, economic and social factors.\n\nThe research confirms the existence amongst College teachers of a culture of working long hours, and identifies examples of stress and burnout. Interview responses support previous research findings concerning the central importance of teacher identity. Interview data underline the importance of personal factors in determining teachers’ responses to workload and their resilience to stress. A model is developed which summarises potential teacher responses to workload stress, and proposes ways in which these may be linked to factors of teacher identity and work cultures. The findings also highlight the pivotal role of managers and work teams in supporting teachers, particularly those most emotionally susceptible to stress.","bibo:AuthorList":["Price, Martin John","Lawy, Robert"],"dc:date":"2010-10-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The purpose of this thesis was to investigate  O2 kinetics as a determinant of exercise tolerance and to consider its potential interaction with the maximum  O2 ( O2max) and the W′ (the curvature constant of the hyperbolic power-duration relationship) in setting the tolerable duration of exercise.  Recreationally-active adult humans volunteered to participate in the investigations presented in this thesis.  Pulmonary  O2 kinetics was assessed on a breath-by-breath basis and exercise tolerance was assessed by a time-to-exhaustion trial, with exhaustion taken as the inability to maintain the required cadence.  A period of repeated sprint training (RST) resulted in faster phase II  O2 kinetics (Pre: 29 ± 5, Post: 23 ± 5 s), a reduced  O2 slow component (Pre: 0.52 ± 0.19, Post: 0.40 ± 0.17 L•min-1), an increased  O2max (Pre: 3.06 ± 0.62, Post: 3.29 ± 0.77 L•min-1) and a 53% improvement in severe exercise tolerance.  A reduced  O2 slow component and enhanced exercise tolerance was also observed following inspiratory muscle training (Pre: 0.60 ± 0.20, Post: 0.53 ± 0.24 L•min-1; Pre: 765 ± 249, Post: 1061 ± 304 s, respectively), L-arginine (ARG) administration (Placebo: 0.76 ± 0.29 L•min-1 vs. ARG: 0.58 ± 0.23; Placebo: 562 ± 145 s vs. ARG: 707 ± 232 s, respectively) and dietary nitrate supplementation administered as nitrate-rich beetroot juice (BR) (Placebo: 0.74 ± 0.24 vs. BR: 0.57 ± 0.20 L•min-1; Placebo: 583 ± 145 s vs. BR: 675 ± 203, respectively).  However, compared to a control condition without prior exercise, the completion of a prior exercise bout at 70% Δ (70% of the difference between the work rate at the gas exchange threshold [GET] and the work rate at the  O2max + the work rate at the GET) with 3 minutes recovery (70-3-80) speeded overall  O2 kinetics by 41% (Control: 88 ± 22 s, 70-3-80: 52 ± 13 s), but impaired exercise tolerance by 16% (Control: 437 ± 79 s, 70-3-80: 368 ± 48 s) during a subsequent exercise bout.  When the recovery duration was extended to 20 minutes (70-20-80) to allow a more complete replenishment of the W′, overall kinetics was speeded to a lesser extent (by 23%; 70-20-80: 68 ± 19 s) whereas exercise performance was enhanced by 15% (70-20-80: 567 ± 125 s) compared to the control condition.  In addition, the faster  O2 kinetics observed when exercise was initiated with a fast start (FS; 35 ± 6 s), compared to an even start (ES; 41 ± 10 s) and slow start (SS; 55 ± 14 s) pacing strategy, allowed the achievement of  O2max in a 3 minute trial and exercise performance was enhanced.  Exercise performance was unaffected in a 6 minute trial with a FS, despite faster  O2 kinetics, as the  O2max was attained in all the variously paced trials.  Therefore, the results of this thesis demonstrate that changes in exercise performance cannot be accounted for, purely, by changes in  O2 kinetics.  Instead, enhanced exercise performance appears to be contingent on the interaction between the factors underpinning  O2 kinetics, the  O2max and the W′, in support of the proposed ‘triad model’ of exercise performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bailey, Stephen John","Jones, Andrew M","Wilkerson, Daryl P"],"dc:date":"2011-02-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Thailand has waged two successful COINs in the past and is currently waging a third on its southern border.  The lessons learned from Thailand’s COIN campaigns could result in modern irregular warfare techniques valuable not only to Thailand and neighboring countries with similar security problems, but also to countries like the United States and the United Kingdom that are currently reshaping their irregular warfare doctrines in response to the situations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nThe first set of COIN lessons comes from Thailand’s successful 1965-85 communist COIN.  The second set comes from Bangkok’s understudied 1980s-90s COIN against southern separatists.  The third set comes from Thailand’s current war against ethnic Malay separatists and radical Islamic insurgents attempting to secede and form a separate state called “Patani Raya,” among other names.\n\nCounterinsurgency is a difficult type of warfare for four reasons: (1) it can take years to succeed; (2) the battle space is poorly defined; (3) insurgents are not easily identifiable; and (4) war typically takes place among a civilian population that the guerrillas depend on for auxiliary support.  Successful COINs include not only precise force application operations based on quality intelligence, but also lasting social and economic programs, political empowerment of the disenfranchised, and government acceptance of previously ignored cultural realities.\n\nBackground:  In 1965, communist insurgents, backed by the People’s Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), began waging an insurgency against Thailand in order to overthrow its government and install a Marxist regime.  The Thai government struggled, both politically and militarily, to contain the movement for years, but eventually, it prevailed. Its success was based on a combination of effective strategy and coordination, plus well-designed and run security, political, and economic programs, the latter nowadays called the “three pillars of COIN,” a phrase developed by David Kilcullen, a modern COIN theorist and practitioner.  One of Bangkok’s most successful initiatives was the CPM program (civil-military-police), which used a linked chain of local forces, police, and the military to not only provide security for villages, but also economic aid and administrative training to rural peoples.  State political programs that undercut communist political programs backed by masterful diplomacy and a constant barrage of rural works helped erode the communist position.\n\nThe 1980s-90s COIN against southern separatists followed similar lines.  The far South’s four border provinces, comprised of 80 percent ethnic Malay Muslims, had been in revolt on and off for decades since Bangkok annexed the area in 1902.  Bangkok had waged haphazard COIN campaigns against rebel groups there for decades with mixed results.  But after the successful communist COIN was up and running in 1980, Bangkok decided to apply similar ways and means to tackle the southern issue.  The government divided its COIN operations into two components: a security component run by a task force called CPM-43, and a political-economic component run by the Southern Border Provinces Administrative Center, or SB-PAC.  SB-PAC also had a Special Branch investigative capacity.  Combined, the 80s-90s southern COIN strategy relied on extensive military intelligence networks to curb violence, civilian administrators to execute local political reforms, and local politicians to apply traditional Malay and Muslim problem solving techniques to keep the peace.  These programs worked well against the multitude of southern insurgent groups that conducted sporadic attacks against government and civilian targets while also running organized criminal syndicates.  By the end of the 1990s, with a dose of Thailand’s famed diplomacy and help from Malaysia’s Special Branch, Bangkok defeated the southern separatists.\n\nIn January 2004, however, a new separatist movement in southern Thailand emerged – one based on ethnic Malay separatism and radical Islam.  It is a well-coordinated movement with effective operational expertise that attacks at a higher tempo than past southern rebel groups.  It moreover strikes civilian targets on a regular basis, thereby making it a terrorist group.  Overall, it dwarfs past southern movements regarding motivation and scale of violence.\n\nThai officials think the Barisan Revolusi Nasional Coordinate, or BRN-C, leads the current rebellion, but there are several other groups that claim to also lead the fight.  Members of the insurgency are nearly exclusively ethnic Malays and Muslims.  The movement demonstrates radical Islamic tendencies thought its propaganda, indoctrination, recruitment, and deeds.  It is a takfiri group that kills other Muslims who do not share its religious beliefs, so it wrote in its spiritual rebel guidebook, Fight for the Liberation of Patani.\n\nBRN-C seeks to separate the four southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, and Songkhla from Thailand in order to establish an Islamic republic.  The separatists base their revolt on perceived military, economic, cultural, and religious subjugation going back to the early 1900s.  And they have a point.  The central government has, at different times in the past, indeed treated southerners with tremendous disdain and sometimes violence – especially those considered insurgents.  But Bangkok has also instituted scores of economic and social aid programs in the south – mosque building, college scholarships, and medical aid, for example – so it has not been a continual anti-Muslim “blood fest” as government detractors have painted it.  Still the maltreatment, certainly many times less than yesteryear, has provided today’s insurgents with ideological fodder for a steady stream of recruits and supporters.  Combined with radical Islam, it has bonded the insurgents to a significant degree.\n\nStatistically, in the 2005-07-time frame, insurgents assassinated 1.09 people a day, detonated 18.8 bombs a month, and staged 12.8 arson attacks a month.  In 2005, they conducted 43 raids and 45 ambushes.  The militants target security forces, government civilians, and the local population.  They have killed fellow Muslims and beheaded numerous Buddhist villagers.  \n\nThe insurgents’ actions have crippled the South’s education system, justice system, and commerce, and also have maligned Buddhist-Muslim relations.  Overall, the separatists pose a direct threat to Thailand’s south and an indirect threat to the rest of the country.  Moreover, their radical Islamic overtones have potential regional and global terrorist implications.\n\nThe Thai Government spent much of 2004 attempting to ascertain whether the high level of violence was, in fact, an insurgency.  To begin with, the government, led by PM Thaksin Shinawatra, was puzzled by the fact that the separatists had not published a manifesto or approached Bangkok with a list of demands.  By mid-2004, however, the insurgents had staged a failed, region-wide revolt, and their prolific leaflet and Internet propaganda campaign clearly demonstrated that a rebel movement was afoot.  By fall 2005, the separatists had made political demands via the press, all of which centered on secession.  By 2006, a coup against PM Thaksin succeeded and the military government that replaced him instituted a new COIN strategy for the south that by 2008 had reduced violence by about 40 percent.  Some of the tenets of this new strategy were based on Thailand’s past successful COIN strategies.  Whether or not the government has concocted a winning strategy for the future, however, remains to be seen.\n\nThis paper analyses these COIN campaigns through the COIN Pantheon, a conceptual model the author developed as an analytical tool.  It is based on David Kilcullen’s three pillars of COIN.  The COIN Pantheon has as its base the concept of strategy, and then as the next edifice, coordination.  Three pillars of security, politics, and economics rise from these to push against the insurgent edifice.  The roof is the at-risk population.  By researching the specifics of all these issues for the three COINs discussed here, the Thai way of COIN emerges.  Then, by measuring these results against the tenets of COIN theorists David Galula, Sir Robert Thompson, and Kilcullen, the Thai Way of COIN is more clearly illuminated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, Jeffrey M.","Nonneman, Gerd"],"dc:date":"2010-12-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

His life time investigation of the mystical dimensions of Islam centered around the life and corpus attributed to the 11th century Hanbalī Sūfī shaykh‘Abdullāh Ansārī of Herāt (1006 - 1089).\nThe thrust of our argument is that this erudite and mystical conversation with the work of the Pīr of Herāt is a methodology and a theology of dialogue with the religious other. This mystical and prophetic journey combines the Ashramic spirituality of Jules Monchanin and Henry Le Saux in India, a masterdisciple\nrelations, the ethical demands of interfaith dialogue, and finally testifies to the hidden and abiding presence of God among the downtrodden of Kabul. Also, de Beaurecueil’s life ascertains the rich and varied heritage of Dominican spirituality and lays bare the conundrums of interfaith encounter.\nThe introduction sets the stage for the friar’s mystical and prophetic life among Muslims. The first two chapters are biographical. They scrutinize the formation period and professional life of both de Beaurecueil and AnSārī. The following two chapters describe de Beaurecueil intellectual and spiritual growth. His erudition on the corpus of AnSārī and his praxis mystica fit perfectly the Dominican\ntradition of search for Truth (Veritas) and contemplata aliis tradere. The last chapter attempts to couch in a philosophical language a mystical encounter. Even though de Beaurecueil’s praxis mystica is both attractive and intimidating, his life is a bold testimony to the demanding complexities and rich opportunities of Christian-Muslim mystical encounter.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dallh, Minlib","Rizvi, Sajjad","Michot, Yahya"],"dc:date":"2011-02-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We present the first experimental\nobservation of these quantum corrections in graphene, a single layer of\ncarbon atoms, over a temperature range 0.02 - 200 K. Due to the peculiar properties\nof graphene, weak localisation is sensitive not only to inelastic, phase-breaking\nscattering events, but also to elastic scattering mechanisms. The latter includes\nscattering within and between the two valleys (intra- and inter-valley scattering,\nrespectively). These specifics make it possible, for example, to observe a transition\nfrom weak localisation to antilocalisation. Our work reveals a number of surprising\nfeatures. First of all the transition occurs not only as the carrier density is varied,\nbut also as the temperature is tuned. The latter has never been observed in any\nother system studied before. Second, due to weak electron-phonon interaction in\ngraphene, quantum interference of electrons survives at very high temperatures, up\nto 200 K. For comparison, in other two-dimensional (2D) systems the weak localisation\neffect is only seen below 50 K.\nThe electron-electron interaction correction is also affected by elastic scattering.\nIn a two-valley system, there are two temperature regimes of the interaction correction\nthat depend on the strength of inter-valley scattering. In both regimes the\ncorrection has its own expression. We show that because of the intra-valley scattering,\na third regime is possible in graphene, where the expression for the correction\ntakes a new form. The study of weak localisation demonstrates that the third regime\nis realised in our experiments. We use the new expression to determine the Fermiliquid\nparameter, which turns out to be smaller than in other 2D systems due to\nthe chirality of charge carriers.\nAt very low temperatures (below 100 mK) we observe a saturation of the electron\ndephasing length. We study different mechanisms that could be responsible for the\nsaturation and discuss in detail one of them – spin-orbit interaction. We determine\nthe spin coherence length from studies of weak localisation and the temperature\ndependence of the conductivity and found good agreement between the two types\nof experiments. We also show the way to tune the spin coherence length by an order of magnitude by controlling the level of disorder. However, experiment shows\ncontradictions with theory both in values of the spin coherence length and the type\nof spin relaxation. We speculate about another spin-related mechanism, spin flip by\nvacancies, which to some extent could also explain our observations.\nWe also present electron transport in graphene irradiated by gallium ions. Depending\non the dosage of irradiation the behavior of electrons changes. Namely,\nelectron localisation can be tuned from weak to strong. At low dosages we observe\nthe weak localisation regime, where the mentioned quantum corrections to the conductivity\ndominate at low temperatures. We found the electron scattering between\nthe valleys to be enhanced, attributing it to atomically sharp defects (kicked out\ncarbon atoms) produced by ion irradiation. We also speculate that gallium ions\ncan be embedded in the substrate or trapped between silica and graphene. We draw\nthis conclusion after investigation of the spin-orbit interaction in irradiated samples.\nAt high dosages electrons become strongly localised and their transport occurs via\nvariable-range hopping.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kozikov, Aleksey","Horsell, David"],"dc:date":"2011-04-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, the functional implications and potential significance of these findings has yet to be established. In this thesis, a transgenic fish system approach (using a new plasmid) was employed to investigate the effect pathways of EDCs in fish, using transgenic UAS-GFP zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model species. \nOne of the most critical steps in this approach is the development of an effective construct for the development of sensitive transgenic zebrafish. The required ERE was cloned and three copies were incorporated into a construct. Three vector systems (pKS+, pCS2+ and pBR322-Tol2) were selected for making new plasmids, and investigated to improve the efficiency for sensitivity and tissue specificity. Three constructs were made and tested progressively in the development process. The plasmids contain three oestrogen response elements (3ERE), a TATA box and GAL4ff. The three constructs, pKS-ERE-Gal4ff, pCS2-ERE-Galf4ff and pBR-Tol2-ERE, were examined by injecting into zebrafish in a transient assay system. The pBR-Tol2-ERE-Gal4ff construct was selected for generating transgenic zebrafish because it showed tissue specific manner (i.e. reduce mosaicism) and Tol2 transposon has the capacity to improving greatly the chances for generating TG fish such as high germline transmission frequency. \nThe construct pBR-Tol2-ERE-Gal4ff required to examine the functional capability of using transient expression assay before generating transgenic fish. The Gal4-UAS/GFP method was adopted and produced a two step amplification of the oestrogenic signal. A novel transient expression assay system was developed using a synthetic oestrogen responsive element, the Tol2 mediated Gal4-UAS systems and the GFP reporter gene, which are responsive to environmental oestrogens using green fluorescent microscopy in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias latipes). The construct worked well and vector system in transient expression assays proved a rapid, sensitive, tissue specific system for the detection of oestrogenic EDCs in both the zebrafish and medaka, indicating the likely wide suitability for application to other fish species. These data indicate that this system would be a particularly powerful technique for use in species with long generation times and/or where there are other difficulties for generating transgenic lines in those species. \nAfter the transient expression assay, the construct pBR-Tol2-ERE-Gal4ff with transposase mRNA was co-injected into early one cell stage and bred for 3 months. The embryos were collected from the founders (a male and a female) and exposed to EE2 to identify the transgenic zebrafish. An oestrogen responsive transgenic zebrafish (ERE-TG fish) was established under an oestrogen inducible promoter derived from multiple tandem oestrogen responsive elements. Gal4ff-UAS system was adopted to generate ERE-TG fish to enhance the sensitivity, which has not been used for generating biosensor zebrafish yet. Oestrogen exposures were shown to induce specific GFP expression in the heart, muscle, otic vesicle, brain, neuromasts, eye/ear ganglions and fin, in addition to that in the liver and gonad, which has not been shown previously in other oestrogen responsive transgenic zebrafish, illustrating both the enhanced sensitivity of our detection system and the potential for these tissues as target sites for wider health effects for exposure to environmental oestrogens. Furthermore, oestrogen chemicals are converted to an oestrogenic signal in different tissues preference. Oestrogen receptors (ER α, β1 and β2) morpholinos (MOs) and exposures with oestrogen receptor antagonist were carried out to assess whether the GFP expression was mediated through the ER, regardless of the subtypes. GFP expression was inhibited through injection of the mixture of ERs MOs compared with uninjected transgenic fish larvae. This result indicated that GFP expression was mediated through the ERs. The lowest detectable concentration of EE2, E2, BPA and NP was 1 ngEE2/L, 5 ngE2/L, 100 µgBPA/L and 1 µgNP/L in ERE-TG fish embryos/larvae. These findings provide that ERE-TG fish embryos/larvae systems are useful both for studying physiological mechanisms and for detecting biological target sites of environmental oestrogens. \nAs a preliminary experiment, immature (40 day old) and mature (3 month old) ERE-TG fish were exposed to low concentrations of EE2 for 7 days to prove its potential for developing tissue-specific models of EDCs at different life stages. The lowest detectable EE2 effect concentration was 5 ngEE2/L in the liver and gonad and 10 ngEE2/L in the muscle in both immature and mature ERE-TG fish. These data demonstrate that muscle is as susceptible as liver and gonad to EE2 and ERE-TG fish (both immature and mature fish) would appear to be a useful system for both detecting target sites for oestrogen chemicals in these life stages fish.\nIn summary, the work undertaken in this thesis has developed transiently and stably transfected zebrafish as a tool for screening oestrogen chemicals to assess for the potential health impacts of oestrogens in the environment, provided novel insights into many tissue target tissues by oestrogen exposure, and has established different patterns of tissue responses for different environmental oestrogens tested suggesting differing functional implications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lee, Okhyun","Tyler, Charles","Kudoh, Tetsuhiro"],"dc:date":"2011-02-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is responsible for absorbing impact loads and resisting shear associated with joint articulation. Pathologies such as osteoarthritis have symptoms including degradation and sometimes complete loss of the articular cartilage, which can lead to poor load support and considerable pain. There has been considerable work in the field of cartilage mechanics. The transient deformation behaviour of loaded cartilage has been examined using several different experimental approaches, and complex models have been developed to accurately describe this behaviour.\n\nThe microstructural response of AC to load is less well understood, however. The aim of this work was to investigate the anisotropy and heterogeneity of cartilage and its effect on the load bearing characteristics. Firstly, existing experimental data were used to create a layered finite element model of cartilage under load. Using this model, three sets of material parameters were evaluated for their suitability in reproducing experimentally observed strains, as well as minimising peak stresses. It was found that only by including the heterogeneity associated with collagen fibre orientation could the layer boundary deformations be exactly modelled, whilst preventing potentially damaging interfacial shear.\n\nTensile testing of cartilage from the equine metacarpophalangeal joint, using samples obtained from each individual layer, was performed to validate findings from the model as well as to determine the variation in mechanical properties in regions of different weight bearing characteristics. It was found that the tensile stiffnesses varied with depth as predicted by the model, demonstrating an average value of 31.3 MPa at the surface and 9.4 MPa in the radial zone, although there was considerable variation. Polarised light microscopy was used to determine the preferential collagen orientation, as well as qualitatively assess the angular spread and other patterns in collagen organisation. It was found that the appearance of the collagen network varied both with depth and location on the joint, with high weight bearing regions showing more isotropic fibre distributions below the surface than low weight bearing regions.\n\nTo directly probe the microstructural response of AC to load, the tensile loading rig was modified to allow simultaneous imaging of the sample using two photon fluorescence microscopy. This allowed the relative displacement of cells and elastin fibres, which are intrinsically fluorescent, to be observed at increasing levels of strain. From locations and orientations of these features, the strain field could be calculated at two length scales: in the vicinity of specific elastin fibres (microns) and intercellular strains averaged over whole stacks (hundreds of microns). The strains at the two different scales did not correlate, suggesting that the microscopic strain environment varies considerably. The elastin fibre network was also investigated, and it was found that fibres appear to interconnect both at pericellular matrices, as well as at \u0027nodes\u0027 in the extracellular matrix.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bell, James Stephen","Winlove, C.

It draws its empirical illustration from the interview and ethnographic data collected over an 18 month period between October 2007 and July 2009 from a group of six students who had enrolled on a vocational FDSc Foundation Degree qualification. The study is comprised of two interrelated parts: Part I of the study illustrates the conceptual and methodological considerations which have driven the exploration of the student experience. The theoretical approach for investigating these experiences is informed by the structurationist perspective of Rob Stones (Stones, 2005). Stones conceptualises the relations between agent and structure four interlinked areas: External Structures, Internal Structures, Active Agency and Outcomes. Conceptualising transitional experience in this manner offers possibilities for a more contextually sensitive, refined, developed and ultimately adequate ontology of structuration. In further developing the framework, the study draws upon the sociological understanding of Basil Bernstein and Pierre Bourdieu. The incorporation of these two distinguishable but related perspectives allows the framework to inform an understanding of the interconnections between the sanctioned practices of a context, the role of agents within a context and the power capacities that are derived from these relations (Mouzelis, 1991; Morrison, 2005). In doing so, it provides a number of lenses in understanding the practices and relations between Further and Higher Education and the consequences of this for agents who enter this transition. Part II critically reflects on the participants experiences. Drawing upon data collected at three institutions: Hope Further Education College (HFEC), Fawlty University-College (FUC) and Ivory Tower University (ITU), the study discusses and explores in depth how the relations between the participants and the external structures of the institutions begin to form three identifiable and conceptually distinguishable transitional experiences which are seen to be either Empowering, Fragmented or Failed. In reflecting upon such relations and experiences, the study suggests that discourses of opportunity surrounding vocational qualifications forwarded to these students prior to, and during their course, is rather more complex than previously illustrated and for some functions as more of a myth than empowering discourse. Rather than providing equal possibility, the relations and transitional experiences that are currently produced only afford restricted opportunities to students choosing this vocational pathway within post-16 sports education. In conclusion, the study begins to discuss the implications of the relations and experiences highlighted for present and prospective relations and practices, asking whether change is possible, creating equal possibilities, not restricted opportunity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Aldous, David Charles Rhys","Brown, David"],"dc:date":"2010-12-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The aim of this study is to diagnose at-risk mathematics students by distinguishing the skills that, if not mastered by the end of Kindergarten, lead to greater difficulty in mathematics in 1st grade. This study’s methodology is mixed as it follows an exploratory and inductive path in light of its use of a hypothesis, an interpretive path in light of its interest in the individual student, and a positivist path in light of its focus on developing rules from analyzed data. An oral diagnostic test based on a comprehensive collection of early number skills was used to test students as Kindergarteners and again as 1st graders. The test results created benchmarks, revealing how the majority of the students performed with early number skills. The test results also revealed that each early number skill is highly, moderately, or minimally predictive in terms of student placement by the end of 1st grade. When comparing the individual skill scores of each Kindergarten student to his/her total test results of 1st grade, the predictive power of each skill emerged. Performing poorly with skills that are minimally predictive did not seem to have an impact on how the Kindergarten student finished in 1st grade; performing poorly with moderately predictive skills had a greater impact on 1st grade placement; performing poorly with highly predictive skills in Kindergarten increased the likelihood that the student would finish in the lower attaining group in 1st grade. A third result of the test showed that certain skills serve as preconditions for other skills; success with certain skills usually meant success with other skills. These connections between skills point to a learning model called in this study “simultaneous pathways,” indicating that there are connections between certain skills, and that students can be learning on several pathways simultaneously. The impact of the predictive power of early number skills is that diagnosis becomes more effective. Early diagnosis means early remediation which may prevent at-risk students from falling further behind their peers. The benchmarks developed by this research will help teachers assess their students because they will know the general skill level of Kindergarteners and 1st graders. This oral diagnostic test informs curriculum development. If test results show that students are missing the skills that are highly predictive, teachers can address those gaps in order to insure mastery.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cohen, Victoria","Martin, Fran"],"dc:date":"2010-04-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

My primary aim is to create a kind of history of the different modes by which autistic persons become subjects. I am following a post-structuralist methodology, based on Michel Foucault’s work on the birth of psychiatry and institutions, his analysis of power relations, his ideas on the objectification and subjectification of the individual, and finally his notions of governmentality and bio-power.  More specifically, I am making use of the Foucauldian techniques of Archaeology and Genealogy in order to investigate the birth of Autism through, the psychiatric discipline, psychoses, classificatory systems and the Asylum of the late Eighteenth and Nineteenth century. Under the same methodological strand, I am treating the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), in relation to Autism, as a disciplinary tool and as a discursive event. I present the existing knowledge on Autism and more specifically  on the ‘impairment in social interaction’ and ‘in pragmatic language’. Finally, I attempt an analysis of Autism as a apparatus, through its episteme, mechanisms, and elements. I give an overview of the two main epistemologies on Autism, that of psychoanalysis and TOM (Theory of Mind) and I introduce the notions of bio-power and governmentality as drive mechanisms, which inform the elements of the apparatus and turn them into regulators of the autistic subjectivity. I am making an analysis of specific elements that I recognize as most important for the objectification and subjectification of the autistic individual; these are: autobiographies and educational institutions. Moreover, I discuss how through a continuum of truth discourses, strategies of intervention, and modes of objectification,  the Autistic individual finds itself in a battle of modes of power, where it either consents to normalization or shields its ‘pathology P’ by disobedience and resistance. Finally, I argue that the deconstruction of existed discursive entities and their reconstruction upon a different epistemological basis leads to a rethink of Autism in terms of Education. What is needed is an emphasis to the notion of παιδεία (paideia), which aims to the creation of free and self-fulfilled human beings, rather than exclusively to the notion of εκπαί δευσις (ekpaideusis), that gives emphasis to the development of capabilities, and in the case of autistic children, to the creation of docile, marginalized bodies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vakirtzi, Eva","Bayliss, Philip"],"dc:date":"2010-12-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Throughout the\n1990s, White Power music expanded significantly from its origins in a clandestine\nnetwork of punk-inspired live shows and record promotions into a multi-million\ndollar, international enterprise of web-pages, radio stations and independent\nrecord labels promoting White Power musicians performing a wider range of\nmusical genres. In this article, we view White Power music as a cultural resource\ncreated and produced by racist movements and used as a tool to further key\nmovement goals. Specifically, we examine White Power music’s role when used to\n1) recruit new adherents, especially youth, 2) frame issues and ideology to cultivate\na White Power collective identity, and 3) obtain financial resources. In doing so we\nrely upon in-depth interviews with White Power musicians and promoters as well\nas representatives of watchdog and monitoring organizations.

This research also relies\nupon an extensive examination of White Power music, lyrics, newsletters and\nwebsites.\nWe conclude that White Power music continues to play a significant role in the\nmobilization of racist political and social movements by drawing in new youth,\ncultivating a racist collective identity, and generating substantial sums of money to\nfinance a range of racist endeavours.","bibo:AuthorList":["Corte, Ugo","Edwards, Bob"],"dc:date":"2008-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We might, for certain\npurposes, consider a coming together of art forms and disciplines. Not the\ncrossovers, mergers and interdisciplinary dialectical fusions we are familiar with,\nbut a convergence or, as the biochemist E. O. Wilson (1999) termed it, a\n‘consilience’, a leaping together of different knowledge. Perhaps this is akin to the\nNobel physicist David Bohm’s ‘Dialogue – A proposal’ (Bohm, et al, 1991), in which\nprocesses, forms and structures synthesise as a creative act? \nAnd so we move from the co-joining action of the word ‘and’ to the dynamic\nagency of ‘in’. Here we may find meaning in ‘…in Action’, the act, or intervention\nthat provokes and evokes a new culture, or a new society, perhaps as the artist\nJoseph Beuys (1990) aimed for in his concept of ‘Social Sculpture’. Furthermore,\nthat notion of dynamism embedded in ‘in Action’ introduces the ideas of\nmovement, change and transformation – from one place to another, from one time\nto another, or from one state of being to another. ‘Far from equilibrium’ (Prigogne\nand Stengers, 1984), this relational interdependence may be understood as that\nembodied by whole systems ecology, or the process, pattern and structure of\nMusic and Arts.\nHere and now is where this paper starts, by considering the ways in which this\ndialogue with and between Music and Arts might, in Action, create questions of\nforesight and ‘ennobling questions’ (Haley, 2008) that may contribute to many\nfutures becoming. The key message is that environmental, social and cultural\nsustainability require creative, imaginative and positive approaches, and that the\narts can contribute to these.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haley, David"],"dc:date":"2008-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

By contrast, I examine musical works in\nterms of what they do and make us do, and to press beyond the ill-conceived\ndualism posed by disciplines – the all-in-the-work vs. the all-in-the-social. This\nmeans aiming for a sociology of art, but now in the ablative sense; in other words,\nwhat can sociology do ‘from’ art, as opposed to what it can do ‘with’ it (as we\nwould say of something we’d rather do away with…). This project requires a\npragmatic turn and an anti-dualist vision. By understanding as part of the same\nmovement both the presence of the world and the presence in the world, the\nobject known and the act of knowing (a point conveyed so well by the notion of\n‘affordance’), pragmatism leads us to say that the work is the list of its occurrences\nand of its effects. What clearly sets this posture apart from aesthetic essentialism\nand from sociological reductionism is that, in this position, the object matters a\ngreat deal – but an object seen now through the ‘feedbacks’ and reactions it\nenables. This reformulated music/sociology involves the co-formation of the work,\nits frame of appreciation and the sensibility of a listener, leading us away from the\nsterile oscillation between the meaning contained in the works and the meaning\nprojected arbitrarily onto them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hennion, Antoine"],"dc:date":"2008-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Thus, examination of social and psychological determinants of participation in leisure time physical activity is important. This PhD examined these determinants within Saudi adolescents.\n\tA mixed methods approach was adopted to identify and test the important social and psychological determinants of participation in leisure-time physical activity. Phase one of the research was qualitative in nature. The purpose of this phase was to illustrate how an elicitation method can be used to identify salient behavioural (termed consequences), normative (termed referents), and control (termed circumstances) beliefs about physical activity as perceived by adolescents. These findings, along with theoretical propositions and evidence from previous studies, contributed to the development of a model of the social and psychological determinants of participation in leisure-time physical activity. They also contributed to the development of ways to measure important concepts in the model. \nPhase two was quantitative in nature and used multiple regression analysis to test the relationships among the key variables of interest. In part one of this phase, self-report questionnaires measured the respondents’ intention to participate in leisure time physical activity (dependent variable); it also measured their attitude toward physical activity behaviour, as well as subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, descriptive norms, self-efficacy, self-identity, and past behaviour (independent variables). The results revealed that attitudes, subjective norms, perceptions of behavioural control predicted physical activity intentions in a Saudi Arabian context. Moreover, descriptive norms, self-efficacy, and past behaviour contributed to the prediction of intentions, while self-identity did not. The results also pointed to some gender differences:  while Saudi females considered attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and self-efficacy during intention formation, Saudi males considered attitude, subjective norms, perceived behaviour control, self-efficacy, and past behaviour only during intention formation. In terms of the salient beliefs, being active, maintaining fitness and controlling weight predicted attitudes; friends, mother, and brother predicted subjective norms; and availability of place, availability of time, and bad weather predicted perceived behavioural control. The results also pointed to some gender differences.  While Saudi females considered being active, maintaining fitness, controlling weight, friends, family, father, mother, and brother, availability of place, availability of time, and bad weather, Saudi males considered being active, friends, family, father, brother, availability of place, availability of time and bad weather. In part two of this phase, five weeks after completing the main questionnaire, participants completed a follow-up questionnaire that assessed self-reported physical activity during the previous five weeks. Results revealed that intention, perceived behavioural control, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and past behaviour, but not attitude, descriptive norms, or self-identity predicted physical activity. Results also pointed out important gender differences. That is, while Saudi males appeared to consider intention, perceived behavioural control, and past behaviour when predicting exercising behaviour, this was not the case for Saudi females who considered intention, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and past behaviour only.\n Overall, the findings of this thesis offer partial support for the capacity of the theory of planned behaviour to predict participants’ physical activity intention and behaviour. The standard TPB variables, self-efficacy and past behaviour predicted intention, while, subjective norms, self-efficacy and past behaviour predicted behaviour. In general, findings also point out important gender differences. That is, while Saudi males appear to consider the standard TPB variables, self-efficacy, and past behaviour when predicting intention, and perceived behavioural control and past behaviour when predicting physical activity behaviour, this is not the case for Saudi females. In contrast, Saudi females consider attitude, subjective norms, and self-efficacy when predicting intention, and self-efficacy and past behaviour when predicting physical activity behaviour. Implications of these findings are that in order to alter physical activity patterns, factors influencing adolescents’ intention and behaviour to participate in physical activity must be addressed. Specially, effective interventions should target cognitive, social, environmental and psychological factors aimed at promoting physical activity among adolescents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alselaimi, Abdullah","Rees, Tim"],"dc:date":"2010-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Previous academic research has examined corruption at structural and corporate levels. This research focused on small groups within organisations and the relationship between their corrupt behaviour and stress. Corruption, group behaviour and stress have all been studied in their own right, but this research brings these concepts together. The Social Identity Theory (SIT) with its focus on both inter-group and intra-group behaviour provided a framework for the work.\nPrevious research suggests that corruption in the workplace can occur when employees are put under pressure to meet difficult targets. SIT suggests that to support their group at such times, individuals who identify strongly with it may be prepared to modify their behaviour. Although, people may find behaving in ways contrary to their normal inclinations stressful, SIT also suggests that high identification with a group can lower stress levels. What was not known was whether these previous findings would apply in the case of corruption. The aim of this research is to investigate whether corruption is influenced by group behaviour, and whether stress is a factor in these acts.\nA series of experimental studies was conducted in which the participants had the opportunity to behave corruptly. The results demonstrate that in all cases, this opportunity was taken, whether the participants were students or senior business executives. High identifiers behaved more corruptly than low identifiers and they experienced less stress. Women were found to be less corrupt than men. Leaders play a definite role in corrupt behaviour. Qualitative analysis showed that corruption in groups is highly contextual and is accompanied by rationalisation. When group identification is strong in a team, and conditions present the opportunity, corrupt behaviour may occur even when threat to the identity is not high. This has led to a new model of corrupt behaviour in which opportunity and social identification definitely play their parts, while threat and/or stress may or may not.

It hinges upon the premise that travel writing is narrative and that the travelling itself must therefore be constructed (or reconstructed) as narrative in order to make it available for writing. By applying narratology to the work of literary travel writers from Frances Trollope to Henry James I show the influence of travelling point of view and writing point of view on the narrative. Where these two points of view are in conflict I suggest reasons for this and identify signs in the narrative which display the disparity. \n\tThere are several influences on point of view which are discussed in the thesis. The first is mode of travel: the development of steamboats and later locomotives increasingly divested travellers from the landscape through which they were travelling. I concentrate on Frances Trollope, Charles Dickens and Mark Twain travelling by boat, and Robert Louis Stevenson and Henry James travelling by rail to examine how mode of travel alters travelling point of view and influences the form of travel writing. The second is the frontier: writing from a liminal space creates a certain point of view and makes travel not only a passage but a rite of passage. I examine travel texts which discuss the Western frontier as well as the transatlantic frontier. As the opportunity for these frontier experiences diminished through the spread of American culture and developments in travel technology, so the point of view of the traveller changes. A third point of view is provided by European ideas of nature and beauty in nature. The failure of these when put against American landscapes such as the Mississippi, prairies, and Niagara forms a significant part of the thesis, the fourth chapter of which examines writing on Niagara Falls in guidebooks and the travel texts of Frances Trollope, Dickens, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Anthony Trollope, Twain and James. Other points of view include seeing the United States through earlier travel texts and adopting a more autobiographical interest in travelogues. \n\tIn the final chapter the thesis contains a discussion of the nature of truth in travel writing and the tendency towards fictionalisation. The thesis concludes by considering the implications for truth of having various travelling and writing points of view impact upon constructing narrative out of travel.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hallett, Adam Neil","Lawson-Peebles, Robert"],"dc:date":"2010-11-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Certain aspects are also compared in relation to other Middle Eastern Bedouin communities (mainly in Syria and Jordan). The theoretical framework is drawn from scholarly writings that help to re-conceptualise the nature of the Bedouin-Israeli power relationship, while the Naqab case study references the literature on power, resistance, indigenous peoples, and state-minority relations.   \nIt is usually claimed that the Nagab Bedouin after 1948 were passive and silent, posing no threat, agency or resistance to the newly-imposed powerful Israeli regime; a simplistic and poorly-supported argument since the actual relationship was, and is, more complex and nuanced. While Israel during this period worked to fragment and control the Bedouin through various policies and tactics, the Bedouin like other indigenous peoples, utilised various methods to challenge the new state in order to survive and remain on their land. \nIn-depth interviews conducted during 2007-2009 in the Nagab (southern Israel) with various tribes and key individuals from the Bedouin community, and with Israeli and British officials, suggest that under military government, Bedouin resistance to the authorities took various forms and mechanisms (e.g., political; cultural; physical and everyday resistance). This was relatively effective and produced several successes; they “won” in limited ways, showing that Bedouin agency is much more substantial than was previously understood.   \nThis contribution to the underdeveloped sub-field of Palestinian-Bedouin research sheds new empirical light on the entire complex of Israel-minority relations.  Today the Nagab remains contested because of Bedouin agency and resistance to the new state’s power.  In fact, the Bedouin successfully modified Israeli state policies, thus requiring a new interpretation of the events of 1948-1967.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nsasra, Mansor","Stanley, Bruce"],"dc:date":"2010-10-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

With the ability to measure the physical strain under “real world” outdoor conditions, the knowledge of the demand during cycling has improved enormously. Power output has been described as the most direct measure of intensity during cycling and consequently power meters becomes a popular tool to monitor the training and racing of cyclists. However, only limited research data are available on the utilisation of power meters for performance assessment in the field or the analysis of training data. Therefore, the aims of the thesis were to evaluate the ecological validity of a field test, to provide an extensive insight into the longitudinal training strategies of world-class cyclists and to investigate the effects of interval training in the field at difference cadences.\nThe first study aimed to assess the reproducibility of power output during a 4-min (TT4) and a 20-min (TT20) time-trial and the relationship with performance markers obtained during a laboratory graded exercise test (GXT). Ventilatory and lactate thresholds during a GXT were measured in competitive male cyclists (n \u003d 15; VO2max 67 ± 5 mL . min−1 . kg−1; Pmax 440 ± 38 W ). Two 4- min and 20-min time-trials were performed on flat roads. Strong intraclass-correlations for TT4 (r \u003d 0.98; 95 % CL: 0.92-0.99) and TT20 (r \u003d 0.98; 95 % CL: 0.95-0.99) were observed. TT4 showed a bias ± random error of −0.8 ± 23W or −0.2 ± 5.5%. During TT20 the bias ± random error was −1.8 ± 14 W or 0.6 ± 4.4 %. Both time-trials were strongly correlated with performance measures from the GXT (p \u003c 0.001). Significant differences were observed between power output during TT4 and GXT measures (p \u003c 0.001). No significant differences were found between TT20 and power output at the second lactate-turn-point (LTP 2) (p \u003d 0.98) and respiratory compensation point (RCP) (p \u003d 0.97). In conclusion, TT4 and TT20 mean power outputs are reliable predictors of endurance performance. TT20 was in agreement with power output at RCP and LTP 2.\nStudy two aimed to quantify power output (PO) and heart rate (HR) distributions across a whole season in elite cyclists. Power output and heart rate were monitored for 11 months in ten male (age: 29.1 ± 6.7 y; VO2max: 66.5 ± 7.1 mL . min−1 . kg−1) and one female (age: 23.1y; VO2max: 71.5 mL . min−1 . kg−1) cyclist. In total, 1802 data sets were sampled and divided into workout categories according to training goals. The PO at the RCP was used to determine seven intensity zones (Z1-Z7). PO and HR distributions into Z1-Z7 were calculated for all data and workout categories. The ratio of mean PO to RCP (intensity factor, IF) was assessed for each training session and for each interval during the training sessions (IFINT). Variability of PO was calculated as coefficient of variation (CV ). There was no significant difference in the distribution of PO and HR for the total season (p \u003d 0.15), although significant differences between workout categories were observed (p \u003c 0.001). Compared with PO, HR distributions showed a shift from low to high intensities. IF was\nsignificantly different between categories (p \u003c 0.001). The IFINT was related to performance (p \u003c 0.01), although the overall IF for the session was not. Also, total training time was related to performance (p \u003c 0.05). The variability in PO was inversely associated with performance (p \u003c 0.01). In conclusion, HR accurately reflects exercise intensity over a total season or low intensity workouts but is limited when applied to high intensity workouts. Better performance by cyclists was characterised by lower variability in PO, greater training volume and the production of higher exercise intensities during intervals.\nThe third study tested the effects of low-cadence (60 rev . min−1) uphill (Int60) or high-cadence (100 rev . min−1) flat (Int100) interval training on PO during 20 min uphill (TTup) and flat (TTflat) time-trials. Eighteen male cyclists (VO2max: 58.6 ± 5.4 mL . min−1 . kg−1) were randomly assigned to Int60, Int100 or a control group (Con). The interval training comprised of two training sessions per week over four weeks, which consisted of 6 bouts of 5 min at the PO at RCP. For the control group, no interval training was conducted. A two-factor ANOVA revealed significant increases on performance measures obtained from GXT (Pmax: 2.8 ± 3.0 %; p \u003c 0.01; PO and VO2 at RCP: 3.6 ± 6.3 % and 4.7 ± 8.2 %, respectively; p \u003c 0.05; and VO2 at ventilatory threshold: 4.9 ± 5.6 %; p \u003c 0.01), with no significant group effects. Significant interactions between group and the uphill and flat time-trials, pre vs. post-training on time-trial PO were observed (p \u003c 0.05). Int60 increased PO during both, TTup (4.4 ± 5.3 %) and TTflat (1.5 ± 4.5 %), whereas the changes were − 1.3 ± 3.6 %; 2.6 ± 6.0 % for Int100 and 4.0 ± 4.6 %; − 3.5 ± 5.4 % for Con, during TTup and TTflat, respectively. PO was significantly higher during TTup than TTflat (4.4 ± 6.0 %; 6.3 ± 5.6 %; pre and post-training, respectively; p \u003c 0.001). These findings suggest that higher forces during the low-cadence intervals are potentially beneficial to improve performance. In contrast to the GXT, the time-trials are ecologically valid to detect specific performance adaptations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nimmerichter, Alfred","Williams, Craig","Eston, Roger"],"dc:date":"2011-02-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631511,"sim:weight":0.436711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107342,"sim:weight":0.319198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77030,"sim:weight":0.3062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10716,"sim:weight":0.272287,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109220,"sim:weight":0.26733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222627,"sim:weight":0.257601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76005,"sim:weight":0.246792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":33566,"sim:weight":0.21934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69767,"sim:weight":0.218587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10844,"sim:weight":0.213858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10910,"sim:weight":0.211607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76786,"sim:weight":0.209718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222790,"sim:weight":0.20235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1645660,"sim:weight":0.19627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631535,"sim:weight":0.195782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76297,"sim:weight":0.187931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26485,"sim:weight":0.180046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76521,"sim:weight":0.17255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49907,"sim:weight":0.170675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929820,"sim:weight":0.152653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

I define the politics of the act as a mode of politics that involves a withdrawal from the state, mobilises around non-hierarchical organising structures and is animated by an imperative of enactment. This can be contrasted with a politics of demand, which is state-oriented, hierarchical in nature and looks to educate the movement for enactment. While Marxists have tended to privilege the politics of demand as the route to radical change, anarchists have favoured the politics of the act, thus creating a clear opposition between these two different ways of acting politically. In this thesis I will argue that this dichotomy between a politics of demand and a politics of the act is overemphasized, and using Deleuze I will show that a politics of the act is the ontological and creative basis through which the politics of demand comes into being, and the politics of demand is enacted by capturing certain flows of creativity into recognisable ‘moments’ that allows them to be made visible and understood at a societal level. Thus, these modes of politics, although they have meaningful differences, are not distinct from each other but rather flow into each other.\nIn IR, conceptualisations of social movements practising a politics of demand have overshadowed the politics of the act, although anarchists have recognised its importance. This thesis will build on this work by drawing on Deleuzian concepts to deepen our understanding of the politics of the act both conceptually and empirically and contributing to the development of a postanarchist politics. It will examine six case studies of activities that are valorised as exemplifying the politics of the act: withdrawal from the state by Food Not Bombs and Social Centres; horizontal organising structures of Critical Mass and Indy Media Centres; and an imperative of enactment through guerrilla gardening and the Clown Army. This thesis challenges those conceptualisations of politics that privilege either the politics of demand or the politics of the act, and demonstrates that both are needed in any conceptualisation of radical politics. It concludes by offering a way of conceptualising both modes of politics through a ‘politics of the molecular’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harrison, Claire Elizabeth","Maiguashca, Bice","Schaap, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2010-09-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The present thesis addresses the Kurdish minority in Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran, investigates and analyses the nature and structure of these four states. The nature of the four states is complex in terms of their population; each one contains more than one faith, ethnicity, and language. One ethnicity, faith or sect may dominate the state which may not necessarily reflect the majority of the population, for example, the minority of Alawis dominating Syria, or the constitution, penal code and political system may be biased to a majority sect (Shia in Iran). The present study investigates, compares and contrasts the twenty-first century policies of Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq towards the Kurds, it examines whether the concept of equal citizenship does exist or not in the four states. \n   The minority rights including the Kurds are the key to pluralism and peace in the Middle East. Over the last 50 years, many Middle Eastern and North African minorities have been oppressed or have struggled to survive, national groups (Berbers, Kurds, Turkmens, etc.), religious communities (Christians, Zoroastrians, Baha\u0027is, etc) or both (Armenians, Jews, etc.). Sects, such as Shia in the Gulf States and Sunnis in Iran have not been successfully integrated within Islam itself.\n   The central argument the present thesis seeks to examine is how equal citizenship (equal access for political, educational, social and economic institutions of the country) can be delivered for the Kurds in the four countries. In order to achieve this, the legal status of the Kurds needs to be changed via reforming and amending the constitution and penal codes of the four states. Recognition of the legal rights of the Kurds and abolishing the discriminatory laws are the cornerstone of a healthy civil society and the key to pluralism and peace in the region.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ahmed, Mohammed Ali","Hashem, Ahmadzadeh"],"dc:date":"2010-11-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Previous work has shown that in the model system Ustilago maydis early endosome motility involves the opposing motor proteins dynein and kinesin-3. Here I performed a detailed analysis of the role of the motors in early endosome motility, using quantitative live cell imaging of kinesin-3, dynein and the endosomal GTPase Rab5a. In the first part of my work, I analysed the role of dynein at MT plus-ends, where the motor forms a strong accumulation that was thought to be involved in capturing early endosomes. I could demonstrate that ~55 dynein motors build up the dynein accumulation. In collaboration with Ms. Congping Lin and Prof. Peter Ashwin (Institute for Mathematics, Exeter), I found theoretical evidence that ~25 dynein motors concentrate and leave the plus-ends stochastically. In addition, dynein motors are captured by an interaction of dynactin and the plus-end binding protein EB1. Together both mechanisms increase the number of motors, which ensures that EEs will be loaded onto dynein before they reach the end of their track. In a second project, I provide evidence that loading of dynein is not restricted to the plus-ends. Instead, dynein leaves the plus-ends and is able to bind to kinesin-3 delivered early endosomes, which changes their transport direction from anterograde to retrograde. Kinesin-3 remains bound to these retrograde EEs. When dynein leaves the organelle, it switches back to anterograde motility. Interestingly, a single dynein wins over three to five kinesin-3 motors. I discuss these findings in the light of current motor cooperation concepts. In a third part, I demonstrated that kinesin-3 has an unexpected role in long-range retrograde endosome motility. In contrast, dynein is only responsible for the distal 10-20 µm. This is possible because most of the hyphal cells contain a symmetric and bi-polar MT array. This MT organization is reminiscent of that in dendrites. Kinesin-3-based retrograde motility is required to mix the organelles and might support long-range communication between both cell poles.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schuster, Martin","Steinberg, Gero"],"dc:date":"2011-02-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Protein kinase C is a serine/threonine kinase found in all eukaryotes that is implicated in the regulation of signalling pathways. Here I report the identification of a protein kinase C-encoding gene, PKC1, which I have shown is cytoplasmically localised and expressed during conidial germination and appressorium formation in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Targeted gene deletion of PKC1 was attempted unsuccessfully, therefore analysis of Pkc1 was carried out by RNAi-mediated gene silencing and selective kinase inhibition. A hairpin dsRNA–expressing construct was designed to target PKC1 and was introduced into Magnaporthe oryzae under the control of an inducible promoter. Silencing was variable but resulted in a loss of viability and when coupled with failure to obtain a gene replacement, suggests that Pkc1 is essential for viability. PKC1 gene silencing resulted in a severe hyphal growth defect and reduction in conidiogenesis. The phenotype was rescued by targeted gene deletion of the dicer- like gene, MDL2, the result is therefore consistent with gene silencing. A chemical genetics approach to selective kinase inhibition was also attempted. A previously characterised, non- essential kinase with a readily scorable phenoype, ATG1, was initially targeted to provide proof of concept in M. oryzae. Mutation of an amino acid residue in the ATP-binding site of the kinase resulted in increased susceptibility to chemically modified inhibitors. However, PKC1 does not tolerate the necessary modification to the ATP-binding site. Finally, analysis of the cell integrity pathway suggests PKC1 acts on this pathway but constitutive activation of the pathway only partially restored viability to the PKC1-gene silenced mutant and it is therefore likely to have other additional cellular targets.","bibo:AuthorList":["Penn, Tina Jane","Talbot, Nicholas"],"dc:date":"2010-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This study used qualitative and quantitative methods to examine closely two spatial abilities, spatial visualisation (mental rotation from memory) and visual realism (three-dimensional drawing and construction ability) in students with reading problems and students with no problems.  \n\nThe aim was also to explore the question of whether students with spatial ability and reading problems were encouraged to use these strengths either in or out of school and whether such abilities could be identified in the early years environment.  Equally, the question of motivational failure related to possible unrecognised potential, particularly in the area of non-verbal/spatial ability was also examined.  This study used longitudinal case studies with five children and their mothers over a period of ten years.  Interviews were transcribed and analysed using a grounded theory approach.  Researcher observations as the teacher of the five children in their primary years provided additional evidence of their reading and spatial abilities at an early age.  In addition, the study uses a Further Education College survey that examines spatial ability and reading problems in 133 post-16 year olds that provides the quantitative element of the study providing evidence about students with spatial abilities and their career choices.\n\nThe data analysis revealed that the five case studies had largely overcome their reading problems due to early intervention strategies for reading together with encouragement and support outside school for their spatial abilities.  Additionally, they have pursued careers, which for the most part, uses their spatial skills.  The data analysis of the College survey showed that the link between spatial ability and reading problems was less secure, although there were a number of students with Specific Learning Difficulties (SpLD) who had high spatial abilities and this proved to be important from the point of view of identifying strengths alongside weakness in literacy, particularly in the early years at school.\n\nEarly identification and acknowledgement of spatial ability as a perceived strength and used to support learning, as opposed to identification of reading problems, a perceived deficit, proved to be a key finding of the research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burgoyne, Christine Anne","Norwich, Brahm"],"dc:date":"2010-08-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Charles Tilly identified two simultaneous processes at work – war-making and state-making which produced modern states in Western Europe.

Hence, a modified version of total-war-making and settler-colonial-existence-making (production) occuring in the settler-colonial-creation phase is proposed.

The sample of relevant literature analyzed revealed inconsistencies in the meanings of the terms when applying W.H. Newton-Smith’s theory of meaning, suggesting the influence of what Edward Said identified as the workings of orientalism. This has conceptual implications on terms such as settler-colonialism and the meaning of the type of war it wages upon the indigenous nations. It also has implications on developing a conceptual analytical tool to understand the dynamics of the production of the settler-colonial existence. Thus, the terms and concepts needed to be de-orientalized before using them in the modified model which was then used to examine initially three settler-colonial cases: the United States, Australia and Apartheid South Africa. The modified analytical model was able to highlight particular dynamics relevant to settler-colonial systems and was then used – with the incremental and imbricate research done in the first three chapters – to examine the Zionist case. It illustrated that while the cases of the United States and Australia were able pass their creation phases, the Apartheid case could not and subsequently collapsed. The Zionist case seems to be still in its settler-colonial-creation phase. This has implications on current analysis concerning the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mansour, Awad Issa","Dumper, Michael"],"dc:date":"2011-02-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

File searches and questionnaires were employed to gather contextual data. Semi-structured interviews were used to gather participant views and thematic analysis was used to analyse these interviews. \nThis was a two part study consisting of two papers. The participants in Paper one of the study were young people with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties (BESD) and their parents or carers. Paper one focussed on the participants’ views and experiences of mainstream and special education after they had experienced both. The views of the special school keyworker were also sought in order to improve understanding of the support and barriers that exist for young people and families. Views were elicited through individual semi-structured interviews which were analysed qualitatively using a thematic analysis approach (Braun and Clarke 2006). To gain contextual information within the county and to help in the process of selecting participants, the files of fifty young people identified as experiencing BESD were searched and analysed and relevant information was recorded. \nPaper two focussed on practitioners’ experiences of supporting young people with BESD. An electronic questionnaire was sent to practitioners from a wide range of agencies and collected qualitative and quantitative data which informed the researcher of the local context and gave insights into practitioner views. Five practitioners were invited to take part in individual semi-structured interviews to explore their views on supporting young people with BESD. Interviews were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Findings from papers one and two were assimilated and the implications for Educational Psychology practice were considered.\nThe following research aims were addressed:\n1.\tTo improve our understanding of the support and barriers experienced by  children and young people with BESD  in a Local Authority \n2.\tTo develop a better understanding of how Educational Psychologists can support children and young people experiencing BESD, their parents, carers and other practitioners.\n\n\n\nSummary of findings\nThe key finding within Paper 1 was that both the young people and parents/carers reported experiences that were contrary to the intentions of current inclusion policy. Broadly, negative experiences were reported at mainstream school and positive experiences were reported while at special school for BESD. Participants felt that they had been treated negatively by mainstream practitioners in particular and that young people had been denied access to the curriculum and activities within mainstream school.  Additionally the young people had experienced bullying at mainstream school and the bullying had been ignored or the young people themselves had been perceived as the bully despite being the victim. Perceptions of and attitudes towards the ‘unseen’ disability of BESD were also referred to and parents and carers reported feeling isolated while their child was attending mainstream education.\nThe key finding within Paper 2 was that practitioners also reported experiences that were contrary to the intentions of the current inclusion policy. They reported many challenges that are faced by practitioners when trying to include young people with BESD in mainstream schools, and when supporting them within the Local Authority. Participants felt that negative attitudes towards BESD exist within mainstream schools, that working with other agencies to support young people with BESD is difficult, that parental involvement is key, but not always possible and that elements within the government and Local Authority context conflict with the inclusion agenda and with meeting children’s needs. \nSignificance and Contribution\nThrough a design informed by Symbolic Interactionism and Interpretivist Analysis the participants authentic voices have been heard in order to deepen our understanding of their experiences. Previous research has explored the views and experiences of young people, families and practitioners; however this is the first time that they have been considered together sufficiently in order to identify shared views.  Additionally, young people, families and keyworkers views were sought at a specific point within the young person’s journey - after they had attended both mainstream school and special school. Furthermore experiences of the transition from mainstream school to special school were considered.\nThe findings within this study suggest that the application of a simple solution (i.e. including young people with BESD in mainstream schools) to a complex problem (the social inclusion of young people with BESD), has had a negative impact. In fact the findings seem to imply that the inclusion of young people with BESD within mainstream schools has actually created the social exclusion that inclusion was designed to alleviate. The evidence for this is present within the findings within this study.\nIn relation to BESD, the medical model has been criticised for individualising the ‘problem’, however if an educational model view of BESD is taken we are led to consider that the education system itself is imperfect. Therefore taking the educational model approach and applying the simple solution of ‘inclusion’ to the very complex problem of social inclusion highlights many areas of difficulty. These areas of difficulty have been outlined in the findings of this study and of previous studies. The identified issues are entrenched within the education system and can only be tackled through an examination of the system itself. The reported experiences of inclusion are more nuanced than the powerful message my data suggests, therefore it is essential to note that this study is not simply suggesting that inclusion is ‘negative’ or ‘bad’ and that special school is ‘positive’ or ‘good’ – a much more complex picture has been presented.\nThe complexities that have been highlighted within this study have also been considered alongside the role of the Educational Psychologist and how they can facilitate inclusion and essentially social inclusion through their work with young people, families and practitioners. As a result of the findings, it has been suggested that further research should focus on examining the education system and in particular the dichotomy between the inclusion agenda and results centred teaching and the specialist provision for BESD that exists since the implementation of the inclusion agenda and whether it is meeting the needs of young people. Further research may also focus on whether the case presented for young people with BESD in this study is similar for young people with other types of SEN. This further research on how inclusion policy translates into practice will be particularly pertinent as new government policies and agendas unfold.","bibo:AuthorList":["Penna Bray, Sally","Macleod, Flora","Tunbridge, Margie"],"dc:date":"2010-05-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631866,"sim:weight":0.461193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25946,"sim:weight":0.409343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.348231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222828,"sim:weight":0.343485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222794,"sim:weight":0.338188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631825,"sim:weight":0.331043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.328759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631913,"sim:weight":0.323069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631721,"sim:weight":0.315091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55808,"sim:weight":0.312742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.303395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10912,"sim:weight":0.298885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225642,"sim:weight":0.291761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631518,"sim:weight":0.288052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631824,"sim:weight":0.282862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77943,"sim:weight":0.267152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.266414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75638,"sim:weight":0.262432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.25943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631736,"sim:weight":0.255127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Italia ’90 world cup reaffirmed Italy’s standing as a world power in football. It also marked a turning point in global sport. At the end of the twentieth century, global sport underwent a period of profound transformation. In parallel to similar process taking place elsewhere in politics, economics and society, sport was entering a period of de-regulation and commodification, which impacted national leagues and local fans. Despite the intensification of transnational global networks resulting from de-regulation, individual nation states still hold significant power. Likewise, national leagues are still significant to football clubs despite the growth of global markets and transnational competitions. Yet these global processes of commodification and de-regulation have impacted fans in vastly different ways. \n\nThis thesis provides analysis of Italian football in relation to the impact of the changing global political economy. Through analysis of the Italian political economy, it will identify the complex personal networks operating across Italian business, politics and football. This has witnessed the emergence of a number of significant charismatic leaders who operate across these networks and utilise patronage to gain an advantage. These patrimonial networks were initially successful, as Italian football quickly adapted to the changing global economy. However, it has not capitalised on this early success. Italian clubs are struggling financially in relation to their European peers. This has been compounded by a series of crises have impacted Italian football.\n\nThe crises within Italian society and football have impacted the engagement of fans. Political engagement has fallen and this is replicated in the stadiums. The historical failure of the Italian state to impose itself has been further undermined by globalisation processes. Traditional regional identities have been reinforced as globalisation has further weakened the nation state. Changes to the patterns of consumption have combined with these traditional identities and has led to a greater particularisation in society. Individualism and regionalism have grown, and this has led to a decline in engagement with wider public life and social capital. One aspect of this decline has been demonstrated by several high profile violent incidents, and deaths at Italian matches. The impact of this decline will be addressed in relation to the formation of supporters’ groups and the match-day experiences of fans. Ultimately this decline is financially affecting the clubs which further contributes to the overall crisis within Italian football.","bibo:AuthorList":["Doidge, Mark","King, Anthony"],"dc:date":"2010-10-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":176809,"sim:weight":0.333171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.255265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108033,"sim:weight":0.209364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109178,"sim:weight":0.205908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929812,"sim:weight":0.20005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108651,"sim:weight":0.192038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86066,"sim:weight":0.161994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.154518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although it is always in principle possible to justify our moral disgust by explaining what it is in a given situation or action that disgusts us, the feeling of disgust often comes first and either draws our attention to the fact that there is something (terribly) wrong in the first place, or makes us aware that the kind of wrongness we are dealing with surpasses what can be accounted for by established moral theory.

Now owned by the region’s Arab states they have operated in the global financial system since the 1960s. Since the 1970s and the enormous inflow of oil revenues, the funds have broadened their asset classes and their institutional development.  Iran’s SWF, one of the youngest funds in the Gulf, differs from its Arab neighbours in terms of structure and operation, and is less active internationally. Characterised by lack of transparency and corruption, Iran’s sovereign wealth investments and management also lag behind those of its neighbours. \nDebate over the transparency of SWFs has highlighted various global practices. Norway’s SWF is reputedly the most transparent in the world; its CSWF provides an operational and structural comparison for the Gulf cases. Recently, organisational measures have been introduced for calculating possible risks from non-commercial investment incentives of SWFs, whose politically-driven investment strategies are viewed as potentially a major threat to the national security of their host countries.  \nAn international working group of 25 countries that sponsor sovereign wealth funds, plus the IMF,  has introduced a set of principles and practices for SWF operation, in order to minimise their possible risk of impacting negatively on global financial and political stability. Most western governments are also introducing regulatory codes to identify threats and protect their own strategic economic sectors from certain SWF investments. This study reviews certain incidents that triggered the transparency debate, and scrutinises the reaction of some of the Gulf CSWFs to these recent regulatory codes and_strategies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bazoobandi, Sara","Niblock, Tim"],"dc:date":"2011-04-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It investigates conceptual and strategic relationships between brands and cultures, focusing specifically on the issue of the unprivileged position of Chinese brands vis-à-vis that of other famous global counterparts. Accordingly, it deploys three illustrative cases from the Chinese context – Jay Chou (a successful Chinese music artist), the 2008 Beijing Olympics opening ceremony, and Shanghai Tang (a global Chinese fashion brand). In so doing, it moves away from the general trend to study the managerial aspects of Western brand building in Chinese contexts, and instead examines how Chinese brands express cultural aspects of their own well-known brand development models in the global marketplace. In short, this study uses a Chinese vantage to examine the emergence of cultural branding (using historical culture and global fashion systems to develop global brands), and its capacity to function as a useful complement to existing models of brand globalisation and global brand culture. The function of the three cases is illustrative and analytic. Collectively, they serve as a lens through which to study Chinese brand development in the global marketplace and examine global brand culture. Each case was fleshed out through various multi-sited ethnographic studies, which consisted of interviewing and observing consumers and managerial workers, the results of which shed light on several important but under-studied aspects of global brand culture. These include Chinese cultural branding in the global context, the cultural approach to branding among various brand actors, and relationships between brands and cultures across branding cultures. Drawing on these examinations, this study not only demonstrates ways in which brands and cultures circulate and construct each other in global brand culture. It also uses these insights to argue for the development of Chinese culture or Chinese-ness into a global brand resource by Chinese brand builders.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zhiyan, Wu","Janet, Borgerson","Jonathan, Schroeder"],"dc:date":"2010-10-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Peroxiredoxins form part of a recently discovered peroxide scavenging system along with thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase and sulfiredoxin.\nThis study describes the purification of a recombinant human peroxiredoxin II from human erythrocytes. The original recombinant clone contained a point mutation at the fourth residue from glycine to valine and a number of problems were encountered with aggregation during purification. Reverting back to the original amino acid sequence allowed the protein to be purified and concentrated without aggregation, as well as leading to over-expression in the same oligomeric state as the native sample from blood.\nThis study also describes the over-expression and purification of the human peroxiredoxin II protein in the intermolecular disulfide form as well as the subsequent crystallisation and X-ray diffraction studies. The crystal structure for this form of the protein was obtained to 3.3 Å resolution revealing the peroxiredoxin to be in the decameric form. In addition conformational changes in the protein that are necessary for formation of the intermolecular disulfide between the peroxidatic (Cys52) and resolving cysteine (Cys172) have been observed. The structure also revealed that these movements did not interfere with the dimer:dimer interface as had been previously suggested. This then allows the disulfide to be seen within the decameric form of peroxiredoxin.\nThe production of covalent complexes formed between peroxiredoxin and sulfiredoxin, and peroxiredoxin and thioredoxin was also investigated. Complexes were stabilised by using DTNB to form a covalent bond between specific cysteine residues. The complex binding results from size exclusion chromatography showed that decameric peroxiredoxin bound to sulfiredoxin in a 1:5 ratio and decameric peroxiredoxin bound to thioredoxin in a 1:10 ratio.\nCloning, over-expression and purification of the selenocysteine containing enzyme thioredoxin reductase was achieved. A minimal selenocysteine insertion sequence was added to the 3’ end of the DNA sequence to drive selenocysteine insertion in place of the typical stop UGA codon. The activity of this protein was found to be low but was greatly increased when co-expressed with a plasmid containing the selA, selB and selC genes. Although the activity of this co-expressed thioredoxin reductase was ~20% of the native enzyme activity, it was comparable to the activity of other recombinant forms of the enzyme.\nThese studies report the purification of all of the proteins necessary to reform the peroxiredoxin system and allow the production of a working assay for peroxiredoxin activity. Together with the first report for a structure of a decameric disulfide form of human peroxiredoxin II a greater insight into the peroxiredoxin system has been obtained.","bibo:AuthorList":["James, Paul Brian Charles","Littlechild, Jennifer"],"dc:date":"2010-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26920,"sim:weight":0.203721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1438472,"sim:weight":0.200177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85935,"sim:weight":0.176616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84807,"sim:weight":0.171946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108826,"sim:weight":0.165677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26064,"sim:weight":0.147036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.141728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930158,"sim:weight":0.140069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23622,"sim:weight":0.1398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27084,"sim:weight":0.124948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929813,"sim:weight":0.117297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26718,"sim:weight":0.0960098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is to say that \nthe machine model should perform in such a way that a  human listener \ncould not discern whether\na description of a scene was generated by a human or by the machine model.\n\nMany linguistic processes are used to generate even simple scene \ndescriptions and developing machine models of all of them is beyond the \nscope of this study. The goal of this study is, therefore, to model a \nsufficient part\nof the scene description process, operating in a sufficiently realistic \nenvironment, so that the likelihood of being able to build machine models \nof the remaining processes, operating in the real world, can be \nestablished.\n\nThe relatively under-researched process of reference object selection is \nchosen as the focus of this study. A reference object is, for instance, \nthe `table\u0027 in the phrase ``The flowers are on the table\u0027\u0027. This study \ndemonstrates that the reference selection process is of similar complexity \nto others involved\nin generating scene descriptions which include: assigning prepositions, \nselecting reference frames and disambiguating objects (usually termed \n`generating referring expressions\u0027). The secondary \nthesis of this study is therefore; \nit is possible to build a machine model that is indistinguishable from the mental models used by humans in selecting reference objects. Most of the practical work in the study is aimed at establishing this.\n\nAn environment sufficiently near to the real-world  for the machine models \nto operate on is developed as part of this study. It consists of a series \nof 3-dimensional scenes containing multiple objects that are \nrecognisable to humans and `readable\u0027 by the machine models. The \nrationale for this approach is discussed. The performance of human \nsubjects in describing this environment is evaluated, and measures by \nwhich\nthe human performance can be compared to the performance of the machine \nmodels are discussed.\n\nThe machine models used in the study are variants on Bayesian networks. A \nnew approach to learning the structure of a subset of Bayesian networks is \npresented. Simple existing Bayesian classifiers such as naive or tree \naugmented naive networks did not perform sufficiently well.  A significant \nresult of this study is that useful machine models for reference object \nchoice\nare of such complexity that a machine learning approach is required. \nEarlier proposals based on sum-of weighted-factors or similar \nconstructions will not produce satisfactory models.\n\nTwo differently derived sets of variables are used and compared in this \nstudy. Firstly variables derived from the basic geometry of the scene and \nthe\nproperties of objects are used. Models built from these \nvariables match the \nchoice of reference of a group of humans some 73\\% of the time, as \ncompared with 90\\% for the median human subject. Secondly\nvariables derived from `ray casting\u0027 the scene are used. Ray cast \nvariables performed much worse than anticipated, suggesting that \nhumans use object knowledge as well as immediate perception in the \nreference choice task. Models combining geometric and ray-cast \nvariables match\nthe choice of reference of the group of humans some 76\\% of the time. \nAlthough niether of these machine models are likely to be \nindistinguishable from a human, the reference choices are rarely, \nif ever, entirely ridiculous.\n\nA secondary goal of the study is to contribute to the understanding of the \nprocess by which humans select reference objects. Several statistically \nsignificant results concerning the necessary complexity of the human \nmodels and the nature of the variables within them are established.\n\nProblems that remain with \nboth the representation of the near-real-world\nenvironment and the Bayesian models and variables used within them are \ndetailed. While\nthese problems cast some doubt on the results it is argued that solving \nthese problems is possible and would, on balance, lead to improved \nperformance of the machine\nmodels. This further supports the assertion that machine models producing \nreference choices indistinguishable from those of humans are possible.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barclay, Michael John","Galton, Antony"],"dc:date":"2010-08-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

One such barrier is intrinsic postzygotic isolation, which proceeds as hybrid sterility or inviability, and is commonly attributed to Dobzhansky-Muller genic incompatibilities. Here, deleterious interlocus interactions occur between incompatible alleles of complementary genes when brought together in the genome of a hybrid. Although these hybrid incompatibilities are widespread, having been identified in mammals, fish, plants and fungi, still relatively little is known about the nature of the genes involved. In the model plant species Mimulus, a Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility exists between two populations of the yellow monkey flower, Mimulus guttatus, in which the interaction between a single gene from a copper tolerant population, Copperopolis, and a small number of polymorphic genes from a second non-tolerant population, Cerig-y-drudion, results in hybrid necrosis in the F1. Hybrid necrosis, a form of hybrid inviability with phenotypic characteristics strongly similar to those of plants responding to pathogen attack, is a common barrier preventing hybridization in plants. As well as being of interest in terms of evolution, hybrid necrosis has practical implications in plant breeding as it prevents the combining of desirable traits from related species in commercial cultivars. In the cross between Copperopolis and Cerig-y-drudion, copper tolerance, conferred by a single major gene, and hybrid necrosis are tightly linked but the independent or synonymous nature of the gene(s) in the Copperopolis population that contribute to these two characteristics is unknown. A key aim of this thesis was to establish the nature of the single gene in Copperopolis that contributes to hybrid necrosis with regards to its linkage to copper tolerance. The gene for hybrid necrosis was found to be tightly linked to, but discrete from, the gene controlling copper tolerance. Three candidate genes for this hybrid necrosis locus were indentified: a Jumonji-domain containing protein with probable function as a methyltransferase, a glycosyltransferase and a possible phosphatase. Interestingly, the latter two have potential functional roles in the plant immune system. The second key aim of this thesis was to perform the first investigation into the small number of genes in the Cerig-y-drudion population that contribute to the crossing barrier. Two QTLs for hybrid necrosis were identified. One QTL on Chromosome 9 is responsible for around 20% of the hybrid necrosis whilst the second QTL on Chromosome 12 acts as an enhancer of the first QTL causing an additional 10% of necrosis. Interestingly both these QTLs contain R genes, further implicating the possible involvement of the plant immune system in this crossing barrier.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lloyd, Deborah","Macnair, Mark"],"dc:date":"2010-10-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

I argue that Silius writes the Punica with a particular moral message in mind, a message that can be discerned through the analysis of the models of virtue demonstrated by the Punica’s characters at these points in the epic. Silius depicts an imperfect model of virtue through the Saguntines’ brutal mass suicide. The Saguntines believe that they should be virtuous by remaining loyal to Rome, but they act through a misguided notion of fides that causes them to commit impious crimes. Virtue also plays a key role in Silius’ Cannae narrative, as his conception of Cannae as a paradoxical turning point in Rome’s history is reflected through the paradoxical nature of virtue that he depicts at Cannae. The contradictory role that virtue plays at Cannae is most apparent in Silius’ portrayal of the two consuls Varro and Paulus. Even though Varro acts without virtue and Paulus seemingly acts according to it, Varro ultimately does more good for Rome than the heroic Paulus. The models of virtue seen at Saguntum and Cannae are connected to the failures that the Saguntines and Romans suffer on the battlefield, but Silius depicts a much more appealing model of virtue by the end of the epic, which leads to Rome’s victory at Zama. This victory is due entirely to Rome’s ability to finally adopt a model of moral behaviour that balances both fides and pietas. At Zama, Scipio leads the Romans by providing a moral example for all to follow. Ultimately, it is Scipio’s moral behaviour that Silius endorses, by making it the true cause of Rome’s victory over Carthage.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yue, Kiu Kwong","Langlands, Rebecca"],"dc:date":"2011-01-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Using a theoretical stance that draws on a sociocultural and socialization framework as a process of change, involving the complex interplay between identity, agency and power, the study explores the factors that contribute to bilingual children’s experiences of schooling, how their experiences change over time, and how the children seek ways to strategically manage their situation. It also explores whether or not experiences of schooling differ between bilingual and monolingual pupils.\nQuestionnaires generating quantitative data were completed by 29 bilingual children from various ethnic backgrounds and 162 monolingual, White British children from 12 schools. Qualitative data were generated through questionnaires with the 29 bilingual pupils exclusively. The voice of the children is central, through interview based case studies involving the perspectives of five bilingual children, their parents, teachers and monolingual peers.\nThe findings reveal a complex picture because, although there is a sameness between bilingual and monolingual pupils, there is a distinctiveness about the bilingual group. However, a variety of experiences are noted between individuals within this group as factors interplay in complex ways. Therefore, bilingual pupils can not be considered to be a unitary group.\nThe socialization trajectories, which include transition into school, highlight that children’s experiences vary and change over time, and are evidently affected by their relationships at school. By choosing strategic management approaches children are seen to shape their own socialization process.\nThe thesis concludes with a discussion of the implications for gaining greater insight into the schooling experiences of isolated bilingual learners through: categorisation of children, the unitary nature of bilingualism, difference and access. Recommendations are made including policy development, teacher development and further research focusing on the voice of the isolated bilingual child.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davis, Loraine Madeleine","Rich, Sarah","Fisher, Ros"],"dc:date":"2010-06-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, many parts of\nthe tree are currently unresolved due to conflicts within the sequence data. These\nsources of conflict include: horizontal gene transfer (HGT), hidden paralogy, and the\neffects of methodological artefacts such as Long Branch attraction (LBA). These\nlimitations are further compounded by absence of key taxa that are yet to be sampled.\nTherefore, whilst phylogenetic methods are fundamentally useful for the\nreconstruction of the tree of life, given their current limitations, additional strategies\nare needed in order to fully resolve the tree of life. Gene fusions represent a potential\nsource of evolutionary synapomorphies useful for resolving contentious branching\nrelationships in the tree of life. I therefore, built a program to analyse whole genome\ndatasets for the presence of differentially distributed gene fusion events (shared\nderived characters - SDCs). These putative SDCs can then be polarised with the help of\ntraditional phylogenetic techniques and used as synapomorphies on the tree of life.\nHaving constructed this program and tested it on established fusion datasets, I\nanalysed five sets of four genomes from across the tree of life (the Deuterostomia,\nFungi, Vertebrata, Viridiplantae and Discicristata). I used this data to identify the\nrelative rates of gene fusion events. Previous studies have suggested that fission\nevents occurred more often than gene fusion events. However, our analysis broadly\nsuggests the opposite (albeit with a higher rate of fissions in the Deuterostomia). This\nresult has direct implications for the use of gene fusions as evolutionary informative\nsynapomorphies because the identification of a lower rate of reversion suggests that\nthese characters are less likely to be homoplasious and therefore represent useful\ntools for polarising evolutionary relationships. Six phylogenetically informative\nsynapomorphies were recovered, three in the Discicristata which resolve the\nmonophyly of the Kinetoplastida and four in the Fungi, one of which represented a\nHGT event and was independently discovered and previously published. Thus, this\nthesis reports the development and testing of a new tool to identify differentially\ndistributed gene fusion events. The datasets analysed demonstrate that the program\ncan be used to find phylogenetically informative gene fusion characters that can help\nresolve the tree of life in conjunction with traditional phylogenetic methods.","bibo:AuthorList":["Leonard, Guy","Thomas, Richards"],"dc:date":"2010-12-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Within the tourism industry, sustainable development is a dominant paradigm and policy makers in the South West strongly encourage the implementation of sustainable management practices within tourism businesses through a wide range of ‘best practice’ manuals, case-studies and guidelines. As a result of these efforts the South West is leading within and beyond the region with regards to sustainability. However, a lack of understanding exists about the underlying reasons why tourism businesses and in particular SMEs embed sustainable management practices. This has the result that the diffusion of best practice at a local or regional level is often assumed to be present rather than understood. To ensure long-term competitiveness and survival of organisations in tourism – as well as in other sectors – the ability to change and alter one’s business practices is vital. In this regard the importance of leadership has been highlighted within the general management literature. However, although leaders within organisations introduce, enact and are accountable for change, research on leadership in tourism is sparse. \nAccordingly, an extensive survey (n\u003d193) was conducted with in-depth semi-structured interviews (n\u003d18) of owners and/or managers of serviced accommodation providers in Torbay. The results demonstrate that the leadership style exhibited by owner/managers outside their establishment strongly influences the extent to which sustainable management practices are implemented within their businesses. Moreover, different leadership styles also have a strong influence on promoting behaviour change through knowledge transfer outside their establishment. To a small number of owner/managers, the benefit of sharing knowledge and expertise is clearly understood, but the majority of participants had only started to identify potential benefits for their businesses. Additionally, the results highlighted that a refinement of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) was required. The standard three-fold model of the Full Range Leadership Theory (FRLT), consisting of transformational, transactional and laissez-faire, could not be replicated as transactional leadership style dispersed into two strands – leadership through active management-by-exception and contingent reward. Four distinct clusters of leadership behaviour were identified among the owner/managers in Torbay, of which ‘Convinced Transformational Leaders’ are the most important as they are responsible for driving change through the tourism industry at a local level. Therefore, this study confirms that, instead of a ‘one-size-fits-all’ policy to encourage widespread sustainable management practices, a more differentiated approach is needed to inspire change and deliver action on the ground.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zschiegner, Anne-Kathrin Conny","Prof. Shaw, Gareth","Prof. Coles, Tim"],"dc:date":"2011-04-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is based on a case study carried out in 2005-2006 in a Greek primary school Y4 class in Cyprus where the author was teaching and investigates the nature and relationship of the two processes when used together.\n\nThe project involved twenty drama sessions (over six months), each followed by a writing task that stemmed from the contents and children’s participation in drama.  The overall aim was to describe ‘what happens when drama is integrated in a writing classroom’. Informed by the Vygotskian theory of learning, it sought to investigate the impact of using drama on children’s: (a) attitudes and views towards writing, (b). engagement with writing tasks and (c) quality of writing.\n\nA qualitative case study methodology and multi-method approach to the design of the study were adopted on the basis of what can best investigate the issues raised by the research questions. Questionnaires, interviews, observations, writing samples, video recordings and researcher’s log were used to collect data throughout the year, before (Sept-Dec) and after (Jan-Jun) drama integration in writing lessons.  \n\nThe collected data were analysed by quantitative and qualitative methods. Findings indicated positive changes in children’s attitudes and views towards writing following the introduction of drama and progressively positive improvements in most children’s engagement in writing. Additionally, analysis of writing samples provided indications of positive contribution of drama towards children’s writing and insights into the interaction between drama and writing content. \n\nOn a theoretical level, this thesis suggests that the concept of mediation is central in interpreting the interactive relationship between drama and writing. It also indicates the impact of drama as a sociocultural setting on children’s agency in their development as writers and raises questions for further research.","bibo:AuthorList":["Christou, Christiana","Fisher, Rosalind"],"dc:date":"2011-01-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The Politics and Practice of Research Policies in the European Union.","bibo:abstract":"Over the past decades, research policies have gained an increasing importance in the overall strategy of the European Union. Early programmes date back to the late 1970s, but in recent years the promotion and funding of scientific research have become a central field of European governance within the wider policy drive towards the making of a ‘knowledge-economy’ in Europe. These developments are not only relevant to better understanding the process of European integration, but they also constitute an important chapter in the history of modern science. Today, EU framework programmes, the main instrument for research support at the European level, are arguably the biggest research funding scheme in the world. Moreover, European policies have introduced innovative practices of scientific collaboration and a new culture of research, which has contributed to key changes in the social and organisational dimension of science.\nThis sociological work examines these issues at two interrelated levels of analysis. First, it explores the emergence and development of Community research policies, in the changing political, cultural and economic context from the 1970s to the present, with a focus on the main narratives that have sustained and legitimised policy choices. Particular attention is paid to the life sciences and biotechnology as a research area where important issues of European governance and political culture emerged and were negotiated. Second, it aims to gain an understanding of the ways in which policy strategies have worked out in the actual practice of scientific cooperation. To do so, the second part of the thesis discusses the results of a micro-sociological study of two transnational networks in stem cell research, funded by the European Union under the Sixth Framework Programme (2002-2006).","bibo:AuthorList":["Liverani, Marco","Hauskeller, Christine","Mazzotti, Massimo"],"dc:date":"2011-04-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

They seem to be disengaged from their past and future, simply floating in different presents as a carrier of desire. One difference between is that the major figures in Tsai’s films are marginal young men and women presenting a sense of alienation and solitude among the residents of the city, and their intimate behavior is portrayed in enclosed spaces. Kim’s films, the major figures are abandoned by and isolated from society, either brutal men or solitary prostitutes.\n\nTsai and Kim always make ample use of the residual in everydayness in order to produce the incessant different present-becoming. These becoming- presents are constituted by unpredictable contingency without the association of cause and effect between event and event. Therefore, for Tsai and Kim, time depicted in the cinematic temporality is enunciated by the permanently present discourse, which is absent from its past and is still unknown for its future, but only produces the infinite moment. In other words, this temporal prolongation is ahistorical, lacking depth and merely progresses in action linking action. Thus it also becomes a fragmentary and not a linear development for its lack of commencement and an end, being an endless present-becoming.\n\nThere is no connection between narrative spatiality in Tsai and Kim’s films. This has become detached from its related and logical linkage prescribed in the classical narrative structure, but randomly, coincidentally and unforeseeably merged together, imbedded with the linguistic system of scission revealing no beginning and end but only providing the characters, Taipei and Seoul residents, like nomadic tribes wandering around without indicating the direction of their coming and going. In other words, these spaces in both post-colonial cities can be regarded as temporary and transitional spaces and create the ephemeral mirage of a playground. Tsai and Kim’s cinematizations of the urban spaces of Taipei and Seoul respectively have been constituted by the present discourse, which makes the spatial marking, to which personal memory as well as collective history attaches, vanish.\n\nThese are the most salient traits in the postmodern text and structure, which can be viewed from both directors’ masterful works among Asian cinema. Moreover, their non-historical discourses, non-moralistic and non-ethical and dehumanized and dystopian text in describing social life as well as non-linear and non-classical narrative structure in constituting cinematic text also make Tsai and Kim’s films catch the international gaze. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of a full postmodern exploration of both directors’ works. This has motivated me to construct a passage from European postmodernity to Asian postmodern films.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chiu, Cha","Canaparo, Claudio"],"dc:date":"2010-08-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

As near-infrared light is highly scattered by biological tissue, the process of image reconstruction is ill-posed and, in general is also under-determined. As such, model based iterative image reconstruction methods are used. These methods require an accurate model of light propagation through tissue, also known as the forward model.\nThe diffusion approximation (DA) to the radiative transport equation is one of the most widely used forward models. It is based on the assumption that scattering events dominate over absorption events resulting in a diffuse light distribution. This is valid in cases with low absorption coefficients or large geometries (greater than a few scattering lengths).\tIn many cases, however, such as in small animal imaging where the source-detector separation is small, this assumption is not valid and so a higher-ordered approximation is required.\nIn this thesis, a three-dimensional frequency domain forward model based on the simplified spherical harmonics (SPN) approximation to the radiative transport equation is introduced. By comparison with a Monte- Carlo model, the SPN approximation is shown to be more accurate than the DA, especially in regions near to the sources and detectors and the increase in accuracy is greater in cases with stronger absorption. This is particularly important for bioluminescent imaging of small animals which involve both small geometries and strong absorption. Due to the asymptotic nature of the\n3\nSPN approximation, the highest ordered model was not necessarily the most accurate, but all models with N\u003e1 were more accurate than the DA.\nThe SPN based forward model has also been implemented into an image reconstruction algorithm. Despite the fact that the SPN approximation does not combine the scattering coefficient and anisotropy factor into a single variable, as is the case in the DA, it was found that it is not possible to reconstruct them uniquely. The SPN based models were shown to be able to reconstruct optical maps with greater accuracy than the DA. However, due to the increased number of unknowns to be recovered, the SP7 based reconstructed images contained significant artefact and cross-talk.\nFinally, a SPN-Diffusion hybrid model was developed in which the SPN model was used in the regions near to the source and the DA elsewhere. This model provides the increase of accuracy of the SPN models in the regions where the DA is insufficient, whilst retaining the computational efficiency of the DA. It was shown that the hybrid model leads to increased accuracy not only in the regions solved using the SPN model, but also in the DA based regions where as in a pure DA model, the errors near the source were propagated throughout the domain. It is also shown that the hybrid model can be solved in half the time of the full SPN model.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chu, Michael","Summers, Ian"],"dc:date":"2010-09-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A manufacturing system concept and implementation methodology is proposed by the Exeter Manufacturing Enterprise Centre (XMEC), which is called the Dynamically Integrated Manufacturing System (DIMS). The overall aim of DIMS is to provide a systematic modelling and control framework in which operational decisions can be integrated with the dynamic system restructuring decisions so as to help manufacturing systems to dynamically deal with changes in the business environment.\nThis PhD research is a part of DIMS research, which focuses on the investigation on operational control in DIMS. Based on the established agent-based modelling architecture in DIMS, this research develops two agent bidding mechanisms for the hierarchical control of production planning and scheduling. These two mechanisms work together to assist manufacturing systems in making optimal and flexible operational decisions in response to changes in the business environment. The first mechanism is the iterative agent bidding mechanism based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) which facilitates the determination of the optimal or near optimal allocation of a production job containing a set of sub-jobs to a pool of heterarchical resources. The second mechanism is the hierarchical agent bidding mechanism which enables product orders to be cost-efficiently and flexibly planned and scheduled to meet the orders’ due dates. The novelty of this mechanism is that it enables orders to be fulfilled within structural constraints of manufacturing systems as far as possible and however enables resources to be regrouped flexibly across system boundaries when orders cannot be fulfilled within structural constraints of manufacturing systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["He, Naihui","Zhang, David Z"],"dc:date":"2011-07-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

At the deepest level, these theological arguments are based on principles of rational psychology such as simplicity and sufficient reason. Moreover, belief that the perfect being is the moral omnipotent God is an act of trust and thus based on the rational psychology of trust. Theists in the Abrahamic tradition subscribe to first cause/necessary being/intelligent creator theology and must therefore remain faithful to any psychological principles (simplicity, sufficient reason, trust) that are the rational grounds for believing in the existence of their God. But such faithfulness results in a deep tension within Judeo-Christian theism. For example, a Christian theist who believes in the Trinity must at the same time remain faithful to the principle of simplicity that rejects the Trinity. Because simplicity is the rational basis for the deeply cherished attributes of the Christian God (first cause/necessary being/intelligent creator), it is argued that faithfulness to psychological principles such as simplicity discipline Christian theistic belief, in particular the belief in the Trinity. Examples of this nature offer a framework for a similar disciplining of Islamic hermeneutics on the basis of rational psychology. Muslim interpreters tend not to systematically engage in the philosophy of religion, and for this reason do not explicitly articulate the psychological principles that gave them their theistic Muslim identity. As a result, they deviate from such principles when it comes time to interpret the original sources of Islam (Quran and Sunna). Consistency is one of the demands of rationality, and it is inconsistent to assume principles in arriving at a theistic Muslim identity and then subsequently fail to apply those principles consistently to the task of textual interpretation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ahmed, Babar","Rizvi, Sajjad"],"dc:date":"2010-10-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Polyvagal theory has not yet been explicitly linked with approach motivation, though there is good reason to do so when considering implications for Bipolar Disorder.  Existing literature suggests that mindfulness and the cold pressor test increase parasympathetic nervous system activation.  The experimenter postulated that they would promote recovery from heightened approach motivation, to baseline states following an exciting trigger, due to their effect on the parasympathetic nervous system.  This study aims to test the feasibility of a laboratory paradigm in which approach motivation is induced and then techniques are deployed whilst approach motivation is simultaneously measured via self-report and physiological response.  Feasibility will be assessed in terms of: a) the extent to which the approach motivation induction task evokes a state of approach to reward; b) the validity of using a cross-over design (A-B; B-A) in which each participant undergoes the approach motivation induction task twice, each time followed by a different technique; c) the extent to which the mindfulness technique can be considered to have construct validity.  A second aim is to determine the likely size of the deactivating effect that “dive reflex” and “mindfulness” techniques have upon elevated approach motivation.  Students completed self-report measures that monitored changes in their mood (approach to reward) and cardiac functioning in response to the mood induction task was recorded.  Participants repeated the task followed by a different technique.\n\nFindings show that the mood induction task increased approach motivation and participants reported to be focussing on their breathing during the mindfulness condition, thus ascertaining the feasibility of the laboratory paradigm.  Self-report showed mindfulness and mind wander conditions at administration 1 to have the desired calming effect.  These elicited large effect sizes.  Heart rate decreased during the cold compress condition at administration 1, with a large effect size.  \n\nInvestigating the mood induction and techniques in a laboratory setting deemed them to be effective.  With a larger sample the levels of significance may be greater.  As physiological processes affected in the general population should also be affected in a clinical population, these findings are clinically relevant.  This pilot study bridges some theoretical gaps by linking polyvagal theory (PVT) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) to approach motivation.  It could be the start of a line of research investigating the clinical utility of mindfulness and compress techniques as self help regulators of emotion for people with Bipolar Disorder (BD).","bibo:AuthorList":["Barnes, Victoria Ann","Wright, Kim"],"dc:date":"2011-05-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It has been suggested that rumination predicts problem solving ability and that child temperament and maternal attributions predict mother-infant bonding. This study aims to investigate the role that brooding and reflective rumination may play in predicting and mediating these relationships in postnatal women.\n Methods: Postnatal women were recruited to complete an online survey.190 women responded and completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Maternal Attribution Scale (MAS), Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ), Parental Problem Solving Task (PPST), Rumination Response Scale (RRS), Infant Behaviour Questionnaire (IBQ) and a confidence in problem solving using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).\n Results: Analyses showed that reflective rumination mediated the relationship between low infant soothability and high negative attributions, on maternal problem solving. Reflective and Brooding Rumination also predicted confidence in problem solving and mother-infant bonding. Analyses showed that infant temperament (soothability and distress) and maternal attributions (positive and negative) predicted confidence in problem solving and mother-infant bonding\nLimitations: This study employed a correlational design and therefore all inferences regarding possible causal pathways are tentative. Limitations include the use of self report measures to assess mother-infant bonding and infant temperament. Additionally the PPST is a new measure which needs further validation.\nConclusions: Reflective rumination may act as an adaptive strategy for women in the postnatal period when faced with difficult child temperaments, and for those employing negative attributions, when faced with parent specific problem solving tasks. In addition, Brooding and Reflective Rumination may be important in predicting difficulties in mother-infant bonding. Difficult Infant temperaments and less positive or more negative maternal attributions, may affect problem solving, confidence in problem solving and mother-infant bonding in the postnatal period. Future research should look to replicate these findings and explicate possible causal relationships within a postnatal population.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gashe, Caroline","O\u0027Mahen, Heather"],"dc:date":"2011-05-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This study aimed to extend previous research by exploring the relationships between emotion recognition, cognitive functioning, and nature of neurological injury. As previous research has typically focussed on children with traumatic brain injury, this study included a more representative sample of the types of focal and diffuse/multi-focal ABI seen in routine clinical practice. Exploratory analyses were conducted on the performance of 14 children with ABI compared with 67 non-ABI controls on measures of emotion recognition from faces and eyes. Children with ABI performed significantly worse than children without ABI on both measures. This deficit remained when controlling for cognitive functioning on the faces task, but not on the eyes task. There was no predictive relationship between emotion recognition performance and scores on a measure of socio-emotional behaviour in the ABI group, although relationships between performance on some cognitive measures and socio-emotional outcomes were found. No significant relationships were found between timing or type (focal or diffuse/multi-focal) of ABI, and emotion recognition performance. The findings highlight the presence of emotion recognition difficulties in a group of children not pre-selected for emotion recognition or socio-emotional difficulties, suggesting that emotion recognition difficulties may be more prevalent than previously anticipated. Further research with a larger ABI sample and longitudinal design would be beneficial in clarifying the potential developmental emergence of predictive relationships between emotion recognition and socio-emotional outcomes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shinner, Caroline Laura","Williams, Huw"],"dc:date":"2011-05-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Family Therapy (FT) and Family Management (FM) approaches to psychosis have been divided by their understanding of causality. FM holds a biological understanding which has been identified as having negative consequences for the person with psychosis. FT, by exploring family interactions has been criticised for blaming families for causing their relations psychosis. These two approaches have now been integrated, but how causality is discussed in an integrated approach has only now been explored. \nDesign and methods. This qualitative research asked clinicians working in the most established integrated service how they discuss causality. Four focus groups were conducted and a framework approach using thematic analysis was used. \nResults. Five themes were explored; uncomfortable discussion; constructing a shared understanding; therapeutic style; limiting exploration; and blame.\nConclusion. Discussing causality with families was identified as uncomfortable. However, through the development of a therapeutic-relationship three identified tools can be used to construct a shared understanding of causality. The therapeutic style of explorative conversation--based in FT, integrated with the stress-vulnerability model--based in FM, was identified as an important aspect of an integrated model that resolved criticisms levied at each individual approach. Factors that limited exploration were identified as major challenges to causality discussions, but techniques to remedy these problems were also identified. The risk of families feeling blamed/blaming themselves and attempts to avoid/reduce blame made up a dominant theme of the research. The research concludes by challenging the need to avoid/reduce blame, arguing that blame should be openly explored within family interventions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Newman, Andrew","Reibstein, Janet"],"dc:date":"2011-05-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is at the root of most of the crises and social malaise of the Nigerian society and is made more serious by the problems associated with ethnicity and arbitrariness by the state and government. Part of the resultant effects of this weak structure include unjust public institutions and social, ethnic, religious and political crises due mainly to a lack of social cohesion, political integration and an unfair principle of distribution of income, resources, goods and burdens in the society. All attempted palliatives by different administrations have all failed and a very bitter 3-year civil war between 1967 and 1970 in which more than a million lives were lost was the first major manifestation of the problem in post colonial Nigeria. \nThis condition of affairs not only makes political stability and development difficult but also stifles the natural ingenuity of the people to grow. And very serious poverty and underdevelopment of the people in addition to a complete absence of liberty and rights have become institutionalised. In reaction, some Nigerians have resorted to all sorts of immoral, illegal and criminal actions and conduct, including corruption, lawlessness, indiscipline, tribalism, nepotism, and ethnicism, etc. Others have joined the political class and accepted the status quo of injustice as justice and hold this to be the proper and easiest way to achieve their life goals. This has inadvertently led to a warped and distorted sense of justice in the society. This sense of justice sees nothing wrong with vices such as public and institutional injustice, crime, fraud, corruption etc and embraces them wholeheartedly.   \nI propose in this research therefore, the analysis of the fundamental ideas and ideals of John Rawls’ political liberalism as contained in his Political Liberalism as a way of addressing these social-political challenges. In doing this, the merits and intentions of Rawls’ two principles of justice which centre on liberty, equality and differences are examined to deduce their level of coherence, relevance and utility to the Nigerian society. An argument will be made that these two principles represent the closest philosophical and sociological paradigm that have the core ideas and ideals necessary in addressing the twin problems of social injustice and political instability in a third world disordered society such as Nigeria.","bibo:AuthorList":["WELSON, EKIYOR","PLEASANTS, NIGEL"],"dc:date":"2011-05-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Drawing on literature relating to the way talk has been enacted in English classrooms for the last thirty five years, it suggests that patterns of verbal interaction have continued to prove resistant to change, despite policy imperatives and university courses. \n\nAdopting a collaborative action research approach, data were collected in three cycles over three years to investigate the perceptions of three successive cohorts of postgraduate students of the role of talk in learning, and the place of the teacher in developing it. Using a sociocultural lens, students’ conceptual and pedagogic understanding of dialogic talk, and their ability to promote it, is examined in depth through nine case studies, as are the factors which the participants themselves identify as enabling or inhibiting engagement with innovation. \n\nIt is suggested that the lack of a commonly agreed definition, and of readily available theoretical guidance, has reduced dialogic talk to just another label. As such, it can play no significant part in developing practice beyond rapid question-and-answer routines of ‘interactive teaching’ and the potentially reductive IRF (Initiation, Response, Feedback) script recorded by researchers (Mroz et al, 2000; Myhill, 2006) before, and after the inception of the National Literacy Strategy (1998a). \n\nTurning to the role of the university, it questions the place of the ‘demonstration lesson’ and whole cohort lectures, urging that significant changes need to be made to the role of the teaching practice tutor, and the nature of ‘partnership’ between schools and university departments. Finally, it speculates that without a significant change in the way university departments examine, and address, the values, attitudes and memories of talk that student teachers bring with them from their own primary classrooms, there will continue to be replication of practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fisher, Anne","Myhill, Debra","Kleine-Staarman, Judith"],"dc:date":"2011-01-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The studies reported in this thesis examine the nature and implications of age-related differences in muscle metabolism during high intensity exercise and recovery. Chapter 4 concluded that during heavy intensity exercise, phosphocreatine (PCr) kinetics did not differ with age or sex, while Chapter 5 revealed that during very heavy intensity exercise, the fundamental τ was slower and slow component amplitude greater in men compared with adolescent boys, indicating that exercise intensity might play a role in determining age-related differences in muscle metabolism. In Chapter 6, two bouts of very heavy intensity exercise were completed, and prior exercise reduced the PCr slow component amplitude in men but not boys. Deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb) kinetics was faster in adolescents compared with adults during both heavy and very heavy intensity exercise, indicating that matching of oxygen delivery to oxygen utilisation is less precise at the onset of exercise in adolescents compared with adults. PCr recovery from high intensity exercise was faster in boys than men, but not different in girls and women, as described in Chapter 7. The speed of PCr recovery was correlated with maturity in adolescents, but was not correlated with end-exercise [PCr] or pH. Two different tests to measure mitochondrial capacity in adolescents were evaluated in Chapter 8, and a fitted curve and gated test were both used to determine PCr recovery kinetics. Finally, in Chapter 9, age-related differences in muscle metabolism and oxygenation during fatiguing exercise were examined; a strong trend for greater fatigue in adults compared with adolescents was accompanied by greater metabolic perturbation in adults. Overall, these data show that muscle metabolism and oxygenation differs between adolescents and adults during and following very high intensity exercise.","bibo:AuthorList":["Willcocks, Rebecca","Williams, Craig A","Armstrong, Neil"],"dc:date":"2011-05-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Other types of visual cues with no social or biological relevance, such as arrows, are claimed not to produce such a direct effect on orienting behaviour. The finding that processing of eye gaze is reduced in individuals with Autistic Spectrum Disorders as well as following damage to the orbitofrontal cortex of the brain, suggests that gaze processing is indeed critical for effective social behaviour and therefore eye gaze may constitute a “special” directional cue. This thesis tested these ideas by examining the influence of socio-biological (eye gaze and finger pointing) and non-social cues (arrows and words) on eye movement responses in both healthy control participants and those with damage to the frontal lobes of the brain. It further investigated the relationship between orienting to gaze and arrow cues and autistic traits in a healthy population. Important differences between the effects of socio-biological and non-social cues were found on saccadic eye movements. Although in the pro-saccade tasks, arrow cues caused a similar facilitation of responses in the cued direction as eye gaze and pointing cues, in the anti-saccade tasks (in which participants have to respond away from the location of a peripheral onset), arrows had a greatly reduced effect on oculomotor programming relative to the biologically relevant cues. Importantly, although the socio-biological cues continued to influence saccadic responses, the facilitation was in the opposite direction to the cues. This finding suggests that the cues were being processed within the same \"anti-response\" task set (i.e. \"go opposite\") as the target stimulus. Word cues had almost no effects on saccadic orienting in either pro- or anti-saccade tasks. Schematicised eye gaze cues had a smaller magnitude effect than photographic gaze cues suggesting that ecological validity (\"biological-ness\") is an important factor in influencing oculomotor responses to social cues. No relationship was found between autistic traits and orienting to gaze or arrow cues in a large sample of males. However, findings from the neurological patients point to a possible double-dissociation between the neural mechanisms subserving processing of socio-biological and non-social cues, with the former reliant on the orbitofrontal cortex, and the latter on lateral frontal cortex. Taken together, these results suggest that biologically relevant cues have privileged access to the oculomotor system. The findings are interpreted in terms of a neurocognitive model of saccadic orienting to socio-biological and non-social cues, and an extension to an existing model of saccade generation is proposed. Finally, limitations of the research, its wider impact and directions for future work are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gregory, Nicola Jean","Hodgson, Timothy Lewis"],"dc:date":"2011-06-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

George Eliot recognised this seminal inter-relationship and sought to unravel its intricacies and complexities through her writing. My thesis explores this contention by reference to two principal questions: how did Eliot conceptualise economic value within her broader individual and social ethics? And how was the integration of economic and wider concepts of the “good” explored and tested within the novels? I frame these questions against the great changes in how economics was theorised over her writing career and, by tracing intellectual connections with Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill and later writers attempting to define and secure the moral underpinnings of political economy, I argue that Eliot was better informed and engaged with that process than most criticism has acknowledged. I also re-examine the equally remarkable developments in Eliot’s life and material circumstances, particularly after the success of her first novels. Her wealth and management of financial capital brought a particular focus to all questions of valuation, not least in relation to her own work and intellectual property. I contend that an inability fully to reconcile the moral and aesthetic core of her art and the high financial rewards it was generating gave the economic ethics she tested in the novels an extraordinary urgency and complexity. \n\nIn my readings of, in particular, the later novels, I argue that the crucial motivations and actions by which her characters attempt to manage economic choice simultaneously parallel and are contained within competing contemporary moral philosophical systems. I conclude that her dissatisfaction with any rule-based system, whether of outcome or duty, led her to consider an essentially Aristotelian ethics of virtue in relation to economic ethics. My final chapters look out beyond individual ethical choice to consider how Eliot’s social and political vision accommodated the economic and its attendant institutions and to suggest a connection with the new liberalism which was starting to emerge in the final years of her life.","bibo:AuthorList":["Coleman, Dermot","Gagnier, Regenia"],"dc:date":"2011-06-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Thereafter, his son William went to London, wrote plays which made him rich and then made a number of investments in Stratford.  Among the various errors in this statement there is one that stands out - the “rich” part.  It is not simply the fact that he made the investments - his house New Place, land, tithes etc. are well documented - it is when he made them that is of significance. The bulk of the Shakespeare family investments were made before William became part owner of the Globe or Blackfriars theatres.  \n\nThis evaluation has focused on the tangible data from the period, chiefly legal and financial records.  \n\nIts conclusions challenge many pre-existing notions of how money flowed into the Early Modern Theatre and into William Shakespeare’s pockets.  \n\nThe fable is that young Will Shakespeare, like the pantomime Dick Whittington, left his poverty-stricken family, walked to London and won his fortune.  In neither case was this true. The Early Modern theatre in London was brutally commercial and the aim was the acquisition of wealth more than the pursuit of art. For William Shakespeare, Pope put it neatly \nShakespeare (whom you and every playhouse bill\nStyle the divine! the matchless! what you will),\nFor gain, not glory, wing’d his roving flight,\nAnd grew immortal in his own despite. \n\nThis thesis provides the evidence to dismiss many of the fantasies that surround William and John Shakespeare’s by replacing these with a clear financial picture of the sources and acquisition of their wealth.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fallow, David","Mangan, Michael"],"dc:date":"2011-07-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

More specifically, the thesis is inspecting the genre of documentary which I am calling competitive hobbyist films: a group of films that has recently emerged within the documentary field of filmmaking which closely inspect niche interest groups within a competitive environment.\nThe documentary titled The Love for the Game (2010), then, will document the community that surrounds the game of Backgammon (predominantly in the United States). Both the film and supporting text will look at new approaches to documentary practice within the competitive hobbyist genre. More specifically, an inspection of the film’s narrative structure serves to expand upon the competitive hobbyist genre and examine how the films within this genre are approached from a narratological perspective.\nI will conclude by illustrating how my research, looking specifically at alternative narrative structures, deploying non-­‐linear, Rhizomatic forms, is relevant, not only to narrative fiction films, but also very much within documentary film.

The purpose of this comparative study is to investigate how the students’ identity is constituted in the multicultural business classroom and on the multi-cultural campus, the role in this of cultural components of the curriculum in international business programmes, the ways in which the wider student experience operates in such multi-cultural settings and the implications of each of these facets for teachers and institutional managers. \n\nInter-/cross-cultural competence is held to be a vital skill that business graduates should be equipped with in order to be capable of working in an increasingly diverse global village, and it is believed that such competence can be developed through frequent communication and negotiation with people from other cultures. Sojourners in this study attempted to negotiate new identities in the multicultural learning environment in the alien context in ways that were strongly influenced by individuals’ biographical and life experiences. There were several influential factors in these sojourners’ processes of learning and transition, including: interpersonal and intrapersonal factors; motivations for studying abroad; the nature of the learning environment they encountered; and the settings in which these interactions took place. Holliday’s (1994) “small cultures” theory and Wegner’s (1998) “communities of practice” are concepts used to help explain sojourners’ experiences in terms of where and with whom they interacted, and how this influenced their perception of the learning experience in the international contexts. \n\nThe three institutes were selected through the purposive sampling method, with pre-set criteria such as the percentage of courses taught in participants’ second or foreign language(s) and the percentage of international students in the student population of the university. The sample of twenty-two student participants was obtained by using opportunistic sampling and snowball sampling methods. The qualitative data set comprised 18 individual interviews, 3 group interviews and 40 diary entries. Data analysis took the form of typological analysis (LeCompte \u0026 Preissle, 1993) by dividing the overall data set into categories or groups based on predetermined typologies.\n\nOne of the main findings of this study is that international students experienced high levels of isolation and marginalisation, which affected their academic confidence and social involvement. The universities concerned were aggressively recruiting international students and making efforts to internationalise curricula, yet the academic and social support on offer was perceived as narrow and very marginalised.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chang, Houheng","Richardson, William","Schaefer, Nadine"],"dc:date":"2011-05-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2709519,"sim:weight":0.424337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.424155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.399131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.397564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46583,"sim:weight":0.394846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85165,"sim:weight":0.390402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.390261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664559,"sim:weight":0.365856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.364074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.358156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.35672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46811,"sim:weight":0.348328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.345836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101478,"sim:weight":0.342474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386857,"sim:weight":0.327496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85336,"sim:weight":0.324166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109170,"sim:weight":0.307654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43646,"sim:weight":0.305353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108075,"sim:weight":0.303627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383625,"sim:weight":0.299243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Popular thinking within communities and rhetoric of elites can intertwine and conflict. Individuals may in fact remember privately events that do not fit easily within the nationalist narratives forwarded by the community leaderships. In the case of Cyprus and other violent events of the past, we are often not discussing violence at all but the memories of respondents. Research has been conducted on the community memories but not necessarily on the 1963-4 period of inter-communal violence and the international intervention/invasion of 1974. Nor has research assessed the effect such memories have on the reconciliation of communities in the present. Through questionnaires and interviews, this research examines the response of Cypriots regarding political relations and attitudes and how these were perceived to have been affected by violence. This thesis argues that there appear to be two types of violent memories; one that may create divisions between communities, while another may encourage a sense of collective victimhood. Through recollection and transmission, such memories could drive communities apart or together, intentionally or otherwise. Often reconciliation needs to take place before a political solution can be found, although these processes exist in tandem. This thesis illustrates that these foundations may have been laid for reconciliation between Cypriot communities at the grass-roots, which would need to be built upon. For this to result in reconciliation, Cypriot elites need to change their policies in a number of areas for this groundwork to constitute a sound progression towards a sustainable solution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Griffiths, Paul Michael","Stansfield, Gareth"],"dc:date":"2011-07-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

To do this it also examined the  gustatory responses to HS drinks before, during and after exercise. All studies compared HS with a low sodium control ([LS] 10-27 mmol.L-1).\nChapter 4 found that during 3 h recovery from dehydration, ingestion of 120 % body mass losses of HS restored fluid balance to a greater extent (121 vs. 84 %) than LS. Chapter 7 was the first to investigate the effects of ingesting HS during exercise in the heat and in an untrained population. HS attenuated the decline in stroke volume [SVDrift] and increase in heart rate [HRDrift], but did not affect rectal temperature [TRec], cardiac output, or oxygen uptake during the second of two consecutive 45 min bouts at 55%  . In Chapters 8 and 9 untrained participants ingested either HS or LS during 30-45 min pre-exercise rest. HS reduced HRDrift and SVDrift but did not affect TRec during 45-60 min exercise at 10% of the difference between   and gas exchange threshold [∆]. HS also increased both time to exhaustion and exercise toleranceduring subsequent exercise bouts at 60-70% ∆. \nChapters 5 and 6 found that taste perceptions act as physiological regulators, in this case, one reflecting the priority to restore hyperosmolality over hypovolemia. Exercise-induced dehydration increased the palatability of water, and decreased the palatability HS, when measured before, immediately after and during 3 h recovery. The changes were highly correlated with physiological indicators of fluid balance. \nThe ingestion of highly concentrated sodium solutions can be both an efficient and acceptable means to improve hydration, reduce cardiovascular stress, and improve exercise performance in the heat. Whilst highly effective, caution should apply since the unpleasant taste evoked by these solutions persists for at least three hours post exercise.","bibo:AuthorList":["Truelove, John William Stephen","Williams, Craig","Byrne, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2011-05-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Faced with problems created by rising ‎unemployment, a rapidly growing population, and fears over dependence on petroleum ‎output and price, the kingdom is currently looking to develop new sources of ‎employment and national revenue. Having joined the World Trade Organization in 2005, ‎Saudi Arabia is committed to liberalizing its markets and opening to foreign participation ‎by creating investment and business opportunities. Developing an international ‎conference sector is considered a potentially suitable way to meet the current domestic ‎and international imperatives to change and the challenges these present.‎\n\nThe growth of new markets and international conference destinations in a globalizing ‎economy is leading to increased research. However, the field is still young: there has ‎been limited attention paid to the perspective of delegates and much of the research has ‎been concerned with western destinations.

However little is known about what factors support gains in the longer-term. This study examines participants’ experiences of the perceived benefits and barriers to MBCT reunion attendance.  Thirteen people, who had participated in MBCT classes for recurrent depression within a primary care setting, were interviewed about their experiences of the reunion meetings or their reasons for not attending. Seven of these had completed their program within the previous 12 to 18 months at the time of interview, and six had completed their program between 20 months and 4 years prior to the time of the interview. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to analyze participants’ accounts. Four themes highlighted the participants’ experiences: In terms of benefits, reunion attendees experienced the reunions as a booster reminding them of their mindfulness practices and as a sanctuary where these practices were further nurtured within an accepting and compassionate environment. Barriers to reunion attendance were difficulties around the group experience and wanting to put the experience behind them. This related to the memory of depression as well as to the program and group experience for some individuals. Theoretical, clinical and research implications are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hopkins, Vivienne","Kuyken, Willem"],"dc:date":"2011-05-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It analyses the way in which a number of discourses have been brought to bear upon the play to delimit and shape its meanings, in the absence of a powerful determining author-figure such as Shakespeare.  \nThe investigation is organised around three “strands”, or elements which reappear in the commentary on the play.  These are “pastness”, the sense that the play is framed as belonging to an earlier era and resistant to being completely interpreted by the later theatrical context being used to reproduce it; “not-Shakespeare”, the way in which Malfi has been set up in opposition to a “Shakespearean” model of dramatic value, or folded into that model; and “the dominance of the Duchess”, the tendency for the central character to act as a focus for the play’s perceived meanings.   It identifies and analyses the co-opting of these elements in the service of wildly varying cultural politics throughout the play’s history.\nSited within the assumptions and practices of Early Modern performance studies, this thesis constitutes an intervention in the field, demonstrating the possibility of a radically decentred approach.  Such an approach is freed from either a reliance on Shakespeare as a prototypical model from which other works are imagined as diverging, or from the progressive narrative of theatre history in which twentieth century scholars “discovered” the true inherent meaning of early modern drama which had been “obscured” by the intervening centuries of theatre practice.  It reveals blindspots and weaknesses in the existing Shakespeare-centred conception of the field, and opens up new possibilities for understanding Early Modern drama in historical and contemporary performance.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bloomfield, Jeremy Charles","Aebischer, Pascale","Milling, Jane"],"dc:date":"2011-06-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

First, I compare the forecast performance of multivariate long memory conditional volatility models (the long memory EWMA, long memory EWMA-DCC, FIGARCH-DCC and Component GARCH-DCC models) with that of short memory conditional volatility models (the short memory EWMA and GARCH-DCC models), using the asset allocation framework of Engle and Colacito (2006). The research reports two main findings. First, for longer horizon forecasts, long memory volatility models generally produce forecasts of the covariance matrix that are statistically more accurate and informative, and economically more useful than those produced by short memory volatility models. Second, the two parsimonious long memory EWMA models outperform the other models – both short memory and long memory – in a majority of cases across all forecast horizons. These results apply to both low and high dimensional covariance matrices with both low and high correlation assets, and are robust to the choice of estimation window. The research then evaluates the application of multivariate long memory conditional volatility models in dynamic asset allocation, applying the volatility timing procedure of Fleming et al. (2001). The research consistently identifies the economic gains from incorporating long memory volatility dynamics in investment decisions. Investors are willing to pay to switch from the static to the dynamic strategies, and especially from the short memory volatility timing to the long memory volatility timing strategies across both short and long investment horizons. Among the long memory conditional volatility models, the two parsimonious long memory EWMA models, again, generally produce the most superior portfolios. When transaction costs are taken into account, the gains from the daily rebalanced dynamic portfolios deteriorate; however, it is still worth implementing the dynamic strategies at lower rebalancing frequencies. The results are robust to estimation error in expected returns, the choice of risk aversion coefficients and the use of a long-only constraint.\nTo control for estimation error in forecasts of the long memory high dimensional covariance matrix, the research develops a dynamic long memory factor (the Orthogonal Factor Long Memory, or OFLM) model by embedding the univariate long memory EWMA model of Zumbach (2006) into an orthogonal factor structure. The factor-structured OFLM model is evaluated against the six above multivariate conditional volatility models in terms of forecast performance and economic benefits. The results suggest that the OFLM model generally produces impressive forecasts over both short and long forecast horizons. In the volatility timing framework, portfolios constructed with the OFLM model consistently dominate the static and other dynamic volatility timing portfolios in all rebalancing frequencies. Particularly, the outperformance of the factor-structured OFLM model to the fully estimated LM-EWMA model confirms the advantage of the factor structure in reducing estimation error. The factor structure also significantly reduces transaction costs, making the dynamic strategies more feasible in practice. The dynamic factor long memory volatility model also consistently produces more superior portfolios than those produced by the traditional unconditional factor and the dynamic factor short memory volatility models.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nguyen, Anh Thi Hoang","Harris, Richard D.

In the first experimental chapter, the phase II time constant (τ) slowed over a 2-yr period in 14-16 yr old boys (25 ± 5 s vs. 30 ± 5 s, P \u003d 0.002) and there was a greater relative VO2 slow component amplitude (Rel. A’2 (%)] during heavy-intensity exercise (9 ± 5% vs. 13 ± 4%, P \u003d 0.036). In the second study, ‘work-to-work’ transitions yielded similar phase II VO2 kinetics during unloaded-to-moderate exercise (U→M) between 11-12 yr old boys and teenagers (19 ± 5 s vs. 22 ± 7 s, P \u003d 0.32) but the phase II τ was significantly lengthened in the latter group at the onset of moderate-to-very heavy exercise (M→VH: 30 ± 5 s vs. 45 ± 11 s, P \u003d 0.011). There were no differences in the phase II τ between teenagers and adult men during M→VH exercise (P \u003d 0.46). In the third study, increasing pedal rate from 50 rev•min-1 to 115 rev•min-1 significantly (P \u003c 0.01) lengthened the phase II τ (32 ± 5 s vs. 42 ± 11 s) and increased the relative VO2 slow component amplitude (10 ± 3% vs. 16 ± 5%) during VH cycling in untrained teenagers but the same parameters were unaltered by pedal cadence in trained junior cyclists (phase II τ: 26 ± 4 s vs. 22 ± 6 s, and Rel. A’2: 14 ± 5% vs. 17 ± 3 %, P \u003e 0.05). The fourth study reported that a reduced relative VO2 slow component amplitude in younger boys compared to men (11 ± 4% vs. 16 ± 3%, P \u003d 0.015) coincided with a lower percentage change in the integrated electromyogram (iEMG) of the m. vastus lateralis from minute 2 to minute 6 of exercise (ΔiEMG6-2: 7 ± 25% vs. 49 ± 48%, P \u003d 0.030), suggesting that alterations in motor unit recruitment might be involved in restricting the O2 cost of exercise above the primary amplitude in children compared to adults. The final experimental chapter tested this hypothesis, but no statistically significant differences were reported for the relative VO2 slow component amplitude between 10-12 yr old boys and men (15 ± 7% vs. 19 ± 4%, P \u003d 0.145). In boys, an excess VO2 temporally coincided with a significant increase in the transverse relaxation time (T2) of the m. vastus lateralis from the VO2 slow component time delay (SCtd) to minute 6 of exercise (41.5 ± 2.4 ms vs. 45.2 ± 2.3 ms, P \u003d 0.001), thereby consistent with the notion that delayed muscle fibre activation might contribute to the development of the VO2 slow component in youth. In conclusion, this thesis has demonstrated that maturational changes in the VO2 kinetic response to heavy-intensity exercise are extended into adolescence. During intense submaximal exercise, the recruitment of higher-order (type II) muscle fibres might be principally involved in modulating VO2 kinetics as children mature but this effect is attenuated in teenage subjects engaged in regular endurance training.","bibo:AuthorList":["Breese, Brynmor","Williams, Craig Anthony"],"dc:date":"2011-07-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Specifically the focus is on the Local Surfer, a surfing type emerging from a typology of surfers observed in the South West of England during my previous study (Beaumont, 2007) and developed through the use of ideal types, a concept taken from Weber (1949).  The Interpretive paradigm was adopted for this study in order to conduct research into the social world of surfing subculture that produced richly descriptive data.  Within this approach qualitative ethnographic methods were used including participant observation, field notes and semi-structured interviews to generate data on the two key themes surrounding the Local Surfer in the study; identity and community.  \n\nIn terms of identity, data reveals a list of the ideal typical characteristics for the Wannabe, the Professional Surfer, the Soul Surfer and the Local Surfer types the last of which highlights significant gender differences within the type itself.  Donnelly and Young’s (1999) symbolic interactionist model of identity construction and confirmation was applied to analyse the Local Surfer and did help illuminate some stages in Local Surfer identity construction.  However, this analysis also revealed limitations of this theories applicability to pursuits rather than sports (which is how surfing is classified to the Local Surfer).  Goffman’s (1969) concept of career was also used to provide an opportunity to present the career of the Local Surfer and in particular provides information on the years after identity construction and the process of ageing within a subculture and a community.  The Local Surfer career is seen as various distinctive stages which the Local Surfer typically progressed through in a linear manner: the “nurturing” stage; the traveller stage; the responsible stage; and the legends stage.\n\nFinally in terms of community, many of the issues associated with community are addressed by focusing on the elements which make up a definition of community established in the early stages of the study.  Current issues for the Local Surfer are also discussed including their fratriachial qualities, the exclusion of women and the phenomenon of localism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Beaumont, Emily","Brown, David"],"dc:date":"2011-06-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

At its beginning, the English mercantile presence in the Hanse towns was only a few years old, and no real basis for a trading and diplomatic relationship had been arrived at, when an English act of aggression brought into play the issue of piracy and other violence at sea, which would henceforth be one of vital importance in Anglo-Hanseatic relations; it saw the heyday of several notorious pirates, and new policies for their suppression on both sides of the North Sea. Hitherto these years have been treated in this context only as part of examinations of much longer periods.\n\tI approach the subject thematically, with some chronological divisions within chapters, examining separately violence by English, Hansards, and third parties, non-violent reprisals, regional and social divisions within England and the Hanse, the Vitalienbrüder, the role of the law, and other factors.\n\tThis thesis will argue that the impact of specific phenomena, particularly the activities of the Vitalienbrüder, on Anglo-Hanseatic relations has been not only neglected but misunderstood, and that attention to English sources can help flesh out our understanding of the Vitalienbrüder’s history. The thesis will further argue that the most important factor in determining the nature of both violent incidents and the response to them, and the broader tenor of Anglo-Hanseatic relations, was the political and economic rise of the English merchant class in the decades following the Black Death. I propose that the two principal issues in Anglo-Hanseatic relations, reciprocity of resident merchants’ rights and piracy, were inextricably entwined with the fact that the group principally affected by both wielded, in this period, greater political influence than ever before. Hence, the study of piracy’s role in Anglo-Hanseatic relations is a window into the wider social, political, and economic history of the period.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pitcaithly, William Marcus Edward","Rodger, Nicholas"],"dc:date":"2011-02-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

As a result of interdisciplinary study, particularly in the area of cultural geography and map making, I found new ways to explore ideas about Cornwall’s heritage, her undermined landscape and expand upon issues raised in my MA dissertation.  Recognising the instability and partiality of maps provided insight and mapping became method as newly revealed pathways and subtly shifting perspectives inspired fresh narratives which challenge stereotypical images of Cornwall and reveal the sometimes dark realities of rurality. \n\n The more personal narratives in this collection reveal a different undermined landscape:  ideas about romantic constructions and inheritance led to explorations of nostalgia, memory and identity. Life events became life writing and many of these narratives reflect a search for direction and for a missing person: the artist I once was.  But there are other disappearances in these narratives and the final chapter gives an account of family events that had to be recorded but which raise ethical questions that life writers cannot ignore.  We must take responsibility for the way we write about vulnerable subjects and recognise what this writing tells us about ourselves: that, as Nancy K. Miller has suggested, by exposing our lives to others through life writing, we too become vulnerable subjects.\n\nThe essay accompanying these narratives reflects upon process and finds ways of giving an account of the writer writing.  It uncovers contemporary theories that are embedded in the narratives and I describe it as an orouboros, a creature that continuously eats its own tail. Like the text it subjects to scrutiny, the essay is a life narrative, an autobiographical act that merges creative and critical thinking and this amalgamation has been my aim since my studies began.","bibo:AuthorList":["Liu-Devereux, Pauline Carol","Johns-Putra, Adeline","North, Sam"],"dc:date":"2011-01-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Entamoeba histolytica is one of several known eukaryotes that harbour strongly reduced mitochondria, called mitosomes, which have lost the vast majority of mitochondrial pathways as well as their organellar genome. While the occurrence and function of mitosomes have been well studied, little is known about their inheritance and division. Mitochondrial division in all studied eukaryotes relies on the participation of dynamin proteins for membrane scission. The central aim of this study was to characterize the dynamin protein family in Entamoeba histolytica and to analyze if they participate in mitosomal division. In relation to this work we studied the occurrence of mitosomes in the distantly related reptilian parasite Entamoeba invadens and revisited the phylogenetic relationships among mitosomal Hsp70, a protein we used for mitosomal localization experiments. Our studies revealed that Entamoeba histolytica contains two classical and two strongly derived members of the dynamin protein family, which we called Drp1, Drp2, Drp3 and Drp4. Drp1 and Drp2 exhibit the classical dynamin protein structure with a GTPase, middle and GTPase effector domain, while Drp3 and Drp4 only appear to contain the dynamin GTPase domain. Using phylogenetic reconstructions we could not identify closely, and thus functionally related, dynamins for Drp1 and Drp2 within the eukaryotic tree of life including the mitochondria‐associated amoebozoan dynamins DymA and DymB. The structurally derived dynamins however, were closely related to amoebozoan and archaeplastidan proteins involved in cytokinesis and chloroplast division. All Entamoeba dynamins are differentially expressed in trophozoites with EhDrp2 appearing to be most abundant and Drp3 expressed the least. We conducted stage conversion experiments using E. invadens to understand the importance of dynamins during cyst formation. During encystation all dynamin expression levels increased. Interestingly, Drp3 expression is strongly upregulated in the mid cyst stages and Drp4 during the late phase of encystation. Thus, Drp3 and Drp4 appear not to be involved in cytokinesis and possibly evolved a novel function in the cyst formation process. We carried out Drp2 enzymatic characterization and localization experiments as well as complementation studies using the related amoebozoan Dictyostelium discoideum in order to understand the role and function of E. histolytica Drp2 in the cell. We found that its kinetic characteristics are comparable to other members of the eukaryotic dynamin protein family by exhibiting low substrate specificity, the ability to oligomerize to higher structures and a substrate dependent cooperative enzyme activity. Drp2 localized to abundant punctate structures in the cytosol but did not colocalize with mitosomes. In addition, Drp2 was not able to complement D. discoideum DymA. Both findings suggest that Drp2 is not directly involved in mitosomal (or mitochondrial) division. We overexpressed Drp2 in E. histolytica and D. discoideum and found a significant effect on cytoskeletal organization. Both strains showed a strong impairment in amoeboid movement, cell‐surface attachment and cell growth. Additionally, the number of nuclei was increased significantly. Our data imply that Drp2 plays an important role for cytoskeletal organization. Additionally in this study, we show that mitosomes are also abundantly present in E. invadens suggesting that mitosomes are characteristic for all Entamoeba spp.. Furthermore, we demonstrate that E. invadens cysts contain mitosomes in high abundance comparable to its vegetative life stage. Our studies verify that mitosomal Hsp70 is part of the amoebozoan protein family and of mitochondrial origin as shown by in silico characterization and localization experiments using the homologous Hsp70 antibody.","bibo:AuthorList":["Siegesmund, Maria","van der Giezen, Mark"],"dc:date":"2011-09-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2734400,"sim:weight":0.115526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Each task requires a particular assembly of cognitive processes, an orientation of attention and set of rules relating action to input — a \"task-set\".  The research reported used a task-cueing paradigm to study preparatory control of task-set. On each trial a stimulus (a coloured shape) was preceded by a verbal task-cue specifying which task to do (judge the shape or the colour of the stimulus). Reaction time and error rate increase on trials when the task changes relative to trials on which it does not. When the cue stimulus interval (CSI) is increased, this \"switch cost\" is reduced, indexing a process of task-set reconfiguration in which top-down control is employed to reconfigure the task-set parameters. Effective reconfiguration may also be indicated by a reduction in the \"response congruence effect\" — poorer performance on stimuli mapped to different responses for the two tasks than for stimuli mapped to the same response.  I present six experiments using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a technique for interfering briefly and harmlessly with neuronal activity in a small region of cortex, to address the question of which brain regions contribute to anticipatory control of task-set as indexed by these behavioural measures.\n\tTo help guide the selection of candidate brain regions, I first present a review and meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of task-switching in the literature. Many fMRI studies, comparing brain activation on task-switch and -repeat trials have been published. Some have also tried to isolate activations related specifically to pro-active control of task-set. The activations reported are quite inconsistent over studies.  I used a quantitative meta-analysis technique to identify which brain regions are most consistently found by studies reporting switch minus repeat contrasts and which may be specifically important for preparation on switch trials. \n\tThe experiments examined the effect of stimulating several regions during the long cue-stimulus interval of a task-cueing paradigm, relative to control conditions. A first pair of experiments suggests an important role in proactive task-set control for two regions in dorsal medial frontal cortex, the supplementary motor area (SMA) and an area known as pre-SMA, though the former region appeared to contribute to reducing  the switch cost while the latter appeared to reduce the effects of response congruence.  In a further three experiments, I examined the role of the right intra-parietal sulcus (rIPS); this appears to play a crucial role in preparation for a task-switch but not post-stimulus task-set reconfiguration. In a final experiment, I used TMS guided by fMRI activations in the same participants to study the effects of stimulation over the left inferior frontal junction (IFJ). The results indicate that a region just anterior to the left IFJ is specifically important for preparing for a switch trial.  I discuss the roles that may be played by these three regions in task-set control.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stevens, Tobias","Monsell, Stephen","Lavric, Aureliu"],"dc:date":"2011-08-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This study sought to determine whether peripherally expressed inflammatory transcripts had significant associations with cognitive performance or cognitive decline, using genome-wide and focussed candidate gene analyses. \n\nThe study used data from 691 participants from the InCHIANTI study of ageing. Participants had undertaken Mini-Mental State Examinations at enrolment and at year 9 of follow-up, and provided peripheral whole blood samples for RNA extraction at year 9. Global gene expression data was generated using the Illumina Human HT12 BeadChip microarray. The study analysed global and inflammatory-focussed gene expression associations with cognitive performance and decline, and gene pathway associations with cognitive performance/decline. A candidate-driven RT-PCR expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis was also performed to determine whether genetic variants associated with cognitive decline affected gene expression abundance in association with phenotypic variation.\n\nRaised expression of a single transcript, C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), had a significant association with poor cognitive performance at global expression analysis and with both cognitive performance and cognitive decline in focussed inflammatory subset analysis. Expression of CCR2 in transgenic animals has previously been associated with both cortical Alzheimer disease pathology and peripheral vascular disease. eQTL analysis identified five significant eQTLs for local genes but no significant associations between peripheral expression of these genes and cognitive decline. \n\nThis study’s analyses present little evidence that peripheral inflammatory gene expression is playing a significant role in cognitive impairment or preceding 9-year cognitive decline in this cohort. Only one inflammatory transcript (CCR2) was significantly associated with cognitive impairment at genome-wide analysis. The CCR2 knockout mouse has been shown to have Alzheimer’s-like pathology; results of this study indicate that the mouse model may have relevance for the human population.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bradley-Smith, Rachel Mary","Littlechild, Jennifer","Harries, Lorna"],"dc:date":"2011-09-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A qualitative case study of service users’ perceptions of an Educational Psychology Service in Wales?","bibo:abstract":"PAPER 1 - Consultation is a widely used model of practice amongst Educational Psychology Services (EPS) in the United Kingdom (UK) as evidenced in the amount of research carried out on this practice (Leadbetter, 2006, p. 246). This paper attempts to supplement the limited evidence on how and why consultation is used. \n\nThis paper provides an account of Educational Psychologists (EPs) perceptions of using consultation in a Welsh Educational Psychology Service (EPS). The study uses a thematic analysis of interviews with EPs and 3 accounts of the practice of consultation are provided as examples of how consultation is used. Data analysis revealed that EPs’ practice is dominated by the influence of Wagner’s model of consultation, which is a result of both university, and service based training and not because they feel it is necessarily the best way of working and were vague about their reasons for using this approach.\n \nEvidence emerged to suggest EPs were only aware of one model of consultation, which is the Wagner model. Evidence also emerged to suggest that EPs confused service delivery models with models of consultation and that EPs are unclear about their unique skills and role when using consultation and feel that schools do not understand the work they are trying to achieve when working in this way. EPs also considered that schools want more time with them, but burdensome bureaucracy hinders this. \n\nThese findings are discussed in more detail at the end of Paper 2 where the overall findings suggest there is a systemic problem in Pantysgawn EPS, where the dominance of the EP role to provide statutory assessments prevents EPs from working in a truly consultative way. The paper ends by discussing the key element of the EP’s role, whether a consistent and rigid adherence to one practice model is practicable or desirable, and the various ways that EP services can monitor outcomes to alleviate some of the bureaucratic processes.                  \nPAPER 2 - Paper 1 of this study looked at EPs’ perceptions of using consultation. Very few studies have looked at service users experiences in consultation based EP services. Paper 2 therefore looks at schools’ perceptions of the EP service and considers the benefits and barriers to effective service delivery using a thematic analysis of interviews with staff from 5 primary and 3 secondary schools. Findings suggest that schools continue to regard the expertise of the EP as being a provider of individual assessments, but they also revealed an awareness of the wider systemic role that EPs can provide. This traditional view of the role of the EP is discussed in terms of a wider systemic pressure for schools to seek this kind of EP intervention due to the Local Authority’s (LA) focus on statutory assessments.\n\nSchools appreciated a greater continuity of EPS staff as this helped them to develop more productive working relationships and they wanted more time with the EP. The findings suggest that the level of bureaucracy and the statutory assessment requirements to gain access to targeted resources were a barrier to working more effectively with schools. The paper ends by integrating these findings with the paper 1 findings and discussing the key element of the EP’s role, whether a consistent and rigid adherence to one practice model is practicable or desirable, and the various ways that EP services can monitor outcomes to alleviate some of the bureaucratic processes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cording, James","Macleod, Flora","Tunbridge, Margie"],"dc:date":"2011-09-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Structural studies of the host rocks have been used to infer that granite generation and emplacement occurred in response to regional D3 NNW-SSE\nextension of moderately thickened crust. Detailed field mapping along the northwestern margin of the granite reveals complex\nmagmatic fabrics defined by K-feldspar and biotite. Close to the pluton margins, a gently NW or SE dipping magmatic foliation is\ndefined by the preferred orientation of K-feldspar and biotite. Further from the pluton margin, the foliation dips moderately NW\nor SE, or occurs in steeply dipping NW-SE trending zones with very strong fabrics. Magmatic foliations tend towards parallelism with\nthe margins of stoped blocks over a distance of one to several metres, but there is no evidence that the blocks deform a previously\nformed magmatic fabric. The Land’s End Granite exhibits low degrees of anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and biotite\nis the carrier. The AMS foliation generally dips gently to the NW or SE and contains two, near-orthogonal lineations that trend ENEWSW\nand N-S. The variations in magnetic lineation orientation correlate with the intensity of the macroscopic feldspar fabric. In\nzones where the feldspar fabric is strongly developed, the AMS has a NW plunging lineation, whereas in zones where the feldspar\nfabric is weak, the AMS has a NE plunging lineation. There is close correspondence between the orientation of the AMS fabrics and\nD3 structures within the Mylor Slate Formation.

D1 deformation is represented by an ubiquitous bedding-parallel S1 cleavage although F1 folds have not been recognised. D2 deformation is more localised and characterised by open F2 folds that verge WSW to NW and are associated with an ENE to SE dipping S2 crenulation cleavage. These structures are commonly obscured by later deformation and contact metamorphism and have not been described previously. A set of steeply inclined NNW-SSE trending, and subordinate set of moderately SE dipping, post-D2 metamorphic quartz veins formed coevally during an episode of strike-slip deformation prior to, or during, the early stages of D3 deformation. D3 deformation is widespread and represented by F3 folds and a WNW to NW dipping S3 crenulation cleavage; it has been recorded previously as D2 deformation. Two orders of F3 folds are developed; first order folds have a wavelength of up to 50 m, verge ESE, and result in vertical or steeply inclined bedding and S1 cleavage on their short limbs. Second order folds usually have a wavelength of 1 m or less and usually verge ESE, unless on the short limb of first order folds, where they verge WNW. Previously published data, indicating a dominant NW to WNW vergence of F3 folds on the northern flank of the Land’s End Granite are incorrect. D3 structures are consistent with formation during the extensional reactivation of large-scale thrust faults. Granite emplacement post-dates all three episodes of ductile deformation but granites and their host rocks are deformed by a late brittle expression of D3 deformation. The Land’s End pluton has been accommodated, at the current exposure level, primarily by roof uplift that has resulted in the tilting of D3 and earlier structures to the NW by 40-50º; this may have been accompanied by differential vertical axis rotations of the host rock.

The Devonian successions form part of the Looe and Gramscatho basins and broadly young to the south throughout the area. Deposition of the green to purple mudstones and sandstones of the Whitsand Bay Formation (Dartmouth Group) had initiated by the latest Lochkovian and was conformably succeeded by the sandstones, mudstones and bioclastic limestones of the Bovisand Fomation (Meadfoot Group). The newly defined Trendrean Mudstone Formation (Meadfoot Group) is dated as mid-Emsian or younger on the basis of palynological studies. These three formations respectively record the transition from lacustrine/fluvial through shallow marine to outer shelf/slope depositional environments during Lower Devonian rifting and the development of the Looe Basin. The lowermost part of the Gramscatho Basin succession is represented by the undated Grampound Formation (Gramscatho Group) that has a faulted contact with the underlying Looe Basin succession. It predominantly comprises mudstone but includes sandstone-dominated ‘packets’ (Treworgans Sandstone Member) consistent with an outer shelf and/or slope depositional environment along the northern margin of the Gramscatho Basin. The conformably overlying Porthtowan Formation (Gramscatho Group) comprises mudstones and sandstone-mudstone couplets and is entirely deep marine. Variscan primary deformation (D1) resulted in isoclinal folding and an associated axial planar cleavage throughout both successions. The ‘Watergate Bay Antiform’ of earlier workers is discounted; the associated outcrop geometry of the Dartmouth and Meadfoot groups is thrust-controlled. D2 deformation is developed around Porth Joke (Looe Basin succession) and intensifies southwards towards the Gramscatho Basin, probably in response to the NNW thrusting of the northern ‘parautochthonous’ margin of the Gramscatho Basin over the southern margin of the Looe Basin. An anomalous 900 m wide zone of steeply dipping S2 cleavage around Penhale Point is interpreted as primarily reflecting reorientation by a large-scale southwards-verging monoformal F3 fold. The structural complexity within the boundary zone possibly reflects a pre-Devonian basement fault influence upon: (i) the transition from shelf to deep marine depositional environments during the Lower-Middle Devonian, (ii) Variscan thrust juxataposition (D1 and D2) of the Looe and Gramscatho basin successions, and (iii) D3 post-Variscan extensional reactivation and reorientation of earlier fabrics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hollick, L.M.","Shail, R.K.","Leveridge, B.E."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Three principal mineralization episodes are recognized. The first episode comprises steeply dipping ENE-WSW striking tourmaline quartz veins precipitated from magmatic-hydrothermal fluids during regional NNW-SSE extension; they are not associated with metalliferous mineralization. The second episode is represented by two sets of vertical/subvertical tourmaline veins striking, respectively, 280degrees and 340degrees. The NNW striking set hosts tourmaline-quartz-cassiterite ( alkali feldspar, apatite, zircon) mineralization and was worked for tin during the 19(th) Century. The first generation of tourmaline in these veins is dominated by the Mg-rich end-member, dravite. The subsequent two generations of tourmaline are dominated by the Ferich end-member, schorl, together with zoned cassiterite with Fe-rich cores and Fe-poor rims. The NNW striking tourmaline-quartz-cassiterite veins at Nanjizal have a similar orientation to cassiterite-bearing veins within the St. just Mining District further north. It is possible that the mineralization at Nanjizal was contemporaneous with mineralization in the St. Just Mining District and hence related to a later magmatic episode and the renewed release of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids during ENE-WSW extension.

The visible bones appeared in context with the surrounding geology with no evidence for later site disturbance or burial. During the excavation the skeleton was entirely enclosed within the coarse grained head deposits. The skeleton was articulated and nearly complete and is identified as Canis familiaris, the\"domestic\" dog. The recovery of this skeleton from the St. Loy Member of the Penwith Formation, generally regarded to be of mid to late Devensian age, is scientifically problematic. The accepted age for the late Devensian is 12-15,000 years BP. The oldest known domestic dogs are dated at about 10,000 years BP, although the burial of a dog or wolf puppy with a human skeleton from Israel 12,000 yrs BP is taken as early evidence of domestication. There are three possible interpretations: (1) the St. Loy Member of the Penwith Formation is younger than previously thought; (2) that Godrevy dog is a very early domestic dog; (3) that it is possible to incorporate a rcent articulated dog skeleton into Quaternary head deposits without any signs of physical disturbance at the site.

Thus a 17th century domestic dog has been enclosed within Devensian coarse grained head deposits with no signs of disturbance to the site.","bibo:AuthorList":["Crisp, G.","Pirrie, D.","Shail, R.K.","Sabin, R.C.","Pirrie, D"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The first episode (primary serpentinisation) is represented by the complex and pervasive hydration of the Lizard peridotite. The second (later) episode is characterised by a pale to dark green, pseudo-fibrous mixture of lizardite and chrysotile that is restricted to fractures (vein serpentine). Mineralised north-north-west and east-north-east trending fault zones contain fragments of vein serpentine generated during this second episode. Faults with similar orientations and mineralogy within the gabbro unit contain adularia which have been previously elated by Ar-10-Ar-39 and K-Ar methods at 210-220 Ma (Triassic). Stable isotope ratios indicate that the mineralisation within the gabbro and peridotite is genetically similar. The primary and secondary serpentinisation episodes are therefore interpreted as pre-Triassic in age. A latest Carboniferous to early Permian age is proposed for the formation of vein serpentine and a late Devonian to Carboniferous age is proposed for the primary serpentinisation episode. This is envisaged to have taken place post-obduction but a pre-obduction initiation of serpentinisation cannot be discounted.","bibo:AuthorList":["Power, M.R.","Shail, R.K.","Alexander, A.C.","Scott, P.W.","Williams, BJ"],"dc:date":"1997","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This research has explored different individual experiences of support (for both group and individual interventions).  The views were explored within the interpretivist paradigm to create an in depth understanding of the individual experience within this relatively under researched area.  Information was collected using semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, observations and a focus group to develop a model that could be used for practice.\nPaper 1 focused on young people’s view of conflict, their experiences of group and individual support and professionals’ views on support, to consider implications for the implementation of any new support interventions within this particular local authority.   The common themes included: the role of physical activity during support sessions, the importance of facilitator qualities, possibly challenging young people’s views of violence, the role of individual work and how it should be used in conjunction with any group work and the importance of systemic factors.\nPaper 2 focused on a new group intervention called ‘LINX’ looking at the experiences of individuals involved with the project using a case study methodology.  This research has identified that there were varied views on group projects such as LINX.  Some of the positives were the identification of a greater range of behavioural coping strategies and improved relationships; though it was debated by some participants whether this would be long lasting.  Some identified negatives of this form of group work were the lack of systemic support and a desire for ongoing work.  Paper 2 built on paper 1, identifying many  themes’ were reflected in this new intervention and I have begun to develop the first steps of a model to guide practice in this area.\nClear implications for policymakers were also identified including the role of Common Assessment Frameworks (CAFs) to highlight domestic abuse.  This could then be followed up with a coordinated system with clearly designated roles to enable support to be better understood, and possibly facilitated.  Clear implications for professional practice include: involvement of educational psychologists’ in awareness raising, by training staff within schools about key issues around domestic abuse, possibly helping to develop a selection programme for support workers based on key characteristics.\nFuture research could consider new support interventions in light of the guiding principles for practice developed through this research.  Ongoing longitudinal work exploring individuals’ views and thoughts about whether support is beneficial would also be of value.\n\nTheoretical perspectives such as attachment theory, social learning theory and systems theory have all been useful in helping to explain the themes identified in this research.\n\nTo conclude this piece of research has investigated views on support provided both individually and through group work (paper 1) attempting to create principles which could be shared with local authorities for consideration in the design, implementation and evaluation of interventions supporting adolescents who have witnessed domestic abuse (paper 2).","bibo:AuthorList":["Ley, Eleanor Rose","Margie, Tunbridge","Flora, Macleod"],"dc:date":"2011-05-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The tensions generated by the attempt to hold together different discourses and to impose regional re-organisation in the context of complex developments both in higher education and in patterns of lay and ordained ministry form the basis of my critique of Hind. I argue that Hind’s recourse to the image of the ‘body of Christ’ in the service of an instrumentalist model of ministry exposes inadequacies of a theological anthropological, Christological and ecclesiological nature. I identify a medieval text, Piers Plowman, as a conversation partner which offers a different way of negotiating an analogously difficult set of issues around learning, discipleship and power. My hermeneutical approach to the poem sees its primary impetus as arising from the constant interplay between the experiences of daily life and the attempt to work out a personal and social understanding of salvation.\n\nBy comparing the ways in which Hind and Langland explore learning as measurable progress, and lay and clerical models of learning, I propose that Piers Plowman offers some valuable resources to the next stage of the Hind process. Not only does the poem foreground the chaotic co-existence of multiple voices in a marketplace of competing definitions of learning, and acknowledge the recalcitrance of communities when presented with opportunities to change, but it also, in the figure of Piers, hints at the possibility of going beyond the lay/clerical impasse. The poem’s recognition of sin and the need for repentance, in contrast to Hind language of management and effectiveness, and its requirement of the reader to participate in the making of new meaning, present an ongoing challenge to a culture of ‘learning outcomes’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burn, Helen Mary","Higton, Mike"],"dc:date":"2011-06-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It examines bureaucracy within the specific context of the higher education institution of the University of Damascus in Syria, using various qualitative research methodologies and techniques including documentary/archival material, observation, and interviews.  The study presents a contrasting assessment of the bureaucratic mode of academic administration at the University of Damascus, considering the links and the relationship between the University and the State on national and organisational levels. On a national level, the study explores the relationship between the University and the State by analysing documentary/archival material supported by literature on the history of Syria and of the University of Damascus. The analysis at national level illustrates that the centralised conduct of bureaucracy the limits imposed by the bureaucratic model of academic administration are in place to safeguard certain ethics and to secure the ethical responsibility of the University towards the State.\n\nThe empirical study shows that the role of bureaucracy in ensuring the accountability of the University to the State and in safeguarding equal opportunities among academics is the primary factor demonstrating the positive aspects of bureaucracy in the context of academic administration in the public sector. However, the empirical study also explores the negative consequences that the bureaucratic mode of academic administration has on the academic profession. Although academics can enjoy a level of participation in academic administration by virtue of the collegial elements outlined here, the adoption of excessive regulations and the concentration of strategic academic, financial, and administrative decisions at the apex of the bureaucratic hierarchy shrinks the autonomy of professional academics and can negatively affect creative academic work by constraining academics in their teaching and scholarly work.\n\nThis study reveals that an understanding of the bureaucratic conduct of Higher Education institutions is incomplete without an appreciation of the context within which the academic instructions operate.  Considering this context, particularly the political context of Higher Education institutions in the analysis, helps us to reassess critiques of the bureaucratic model and to present an alternative understanding of bureaucratic constraints in the public Higher Education sector.","bibo:AuthorList":["Almasri, Lubna","Jeanes, Emma"],"dc:date":"2011-03-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The voice of the year 11 student.","bibo:abstract":"In 2001 the then UK Government set a national target to get 50 per cent of young people between the ages of 18 and 30 into higher education by the year 2010.  To achieve this goal, higher education institutions were required to deliver Widening Participation initiatives that would target under-represented groups in a bid to raise aspirations and bring them into the sector. The study that underpins this thesis was an investigation into the issues surrounding widening participation from the perspective of students in their final year of compulsory schooling. It began as a year-long longitudinal study of the students’ views as they moved towards a key transitional point in their lives. Nine students were identified from Year 11 in one school. Three were drawn from each of the following three categories or groups of students: (i) ‘traditional students’, these were students who were deemed as belonging to groups that were already well-represented in higher education; (ii) ‘non-traditional’ students, these were deemed ‘non-traditional’ in the sense that they were seen as belonging to groups that were under-represented in higher education; (iii) ‘widening participation’ students, these were recipients of a widening participation initiative delivered by their nearest university which, by implication, also deemed them as being ‘non-traditional’ in the sense that they were seen as belonging to groups that were under-represented in higher education. Each participant was interviewed in-depth three times whilst they were in Year 11; in December 2003, in March 2004, and again in June 2004. Whilst all interviews sought to elicit information about their lives at that point in time, the first interview was intended to gather relevant information about their past lives, the second a more in-depth look at their current lives, and the third focused on their future lives. Follow-up data were collected from some of the participants in 2009, 2010 and 2011. An in-depth interview also took place in June 2004 with the university’s Widening Participation Officer and the school’s Head of Year 11 and Widening Participation Co-ordinator. They are considered to be key informants to widening participation initiatives, more broadly in the case of the former, and specific to the school in the case of the latter.   \n   The thesis reports on the process through which participants were selected (or not selected) for widening participation intervention, learning identities in school and out, imagined futures, choices, and ultimately what happened to those students who were tracked beyond Year 11. Flaws in the widening participation policy agenda at the time of the main data collection period were identified as: (i) the individualization of the problem which drew attention away from the structural nature of the problem of under-representation and also from deep-rooted flaws within the education system; (ii) the lack of awareness of the longitudinal nature of the problem whereby entrance into higher education is dependent on prior learning and prior qualifications – this resulted in little or no account being taken in the selection process of widening participation-targeted individuals’ previous patterns of achievements, such that they may not be on a trajectory that makes higher education a viable option, and (iii) the valuing of non-participation in higher education.\n   The thesis concluded by acknowledging that a new legislative framework about to be implemented in 2012 appears to be addressing some of these concerns. Issues that remain unaddressed include deep-rooted problems within the formal education system, the valuing of non-participation and of vocational training, and an appreciation that learning takes place on a trajectory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Devincenzi, Karl","Macleod, Flora"],"dc:date":"2011-06-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4155856,"sim:weight":0.5718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154797,"sim:weight":0.557078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4152136,"sim:weight":0.538206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.484535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709519,"sim:weight":0.471836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51515,"sim:weight":0.43297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82073,"sim:weight":0.425628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154826,"sim:weight":0.422421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.422421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162458,"sim:weight":0.399951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.388709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101388,"sim:weight":0.385416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162456,"sim:weight":0.377269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18050,"sim:weight":0.368525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156060,"sim:weight":0.367652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160878,"sim:weight":0.365514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154415,"sim:weight":0.363241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387381,"sim:weight":0.360922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41233,"sim:weight":0.360059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3533,"sim:weight":0.359535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Probabilistic topic models, on\nthe other hand, are capable of discovering hidden thematic structure in large archives of\ndocuments, and have been an active research area in the field of information retrieval.\nThe work in this thesis focuses on developing topic models for automatic sentiment\nanalysis of web data, by combining the ideas from both research domains.\n\nOne noticeable issue of most previous work in sentiment analysis is that the trained\nclassifier is domain dependent, and the labelled corpora required for training could be\ndifficult to acquire in real world applications. Another issue is that the dependencies\nbetween sentiment/subjectivity and topics are not taken into consideration. The main\ncontribution of this thesis is therefore the introduction of three probabilistic topic\nmodels, which address the above concerns by modelling sentiment/subjectivity and topic\nsimultaneously.\n\nThe first model is called the joint sentiment-topic (JST) model based on latent Dirichlet\nallocation (LDA), which detects sentiment and topic simultaneously from text. Unlike\nsupervised approaches to sentiment classification which often fail to produce\nsatisfactory performance when applied to new domains, the weakly-supervised nature of JST\nmakes it highly portable to other domains, where the only supervision information\nrequired is a domain-independent sentiment lexicon. Apart from document-level sentiment\nclassification results, JST can also extract sentiment-bearing topics automatically,\nwhich is a distinct feature compared to the existing sentiment analysis approaches.\n\n\nThe second model is a dynamic version of JST called the dynamic joint sentiment-topic\n(dJST) model. dJST respects the ordering of documents, and allows the analysis of topic\nand sentiment evolution of document archives that are collected over a long time span. By\naccounting for the historical dependencies of documents from the past epochs in the\ngenerative process, dJST gives a richer posterior topical structure than JST, and can\nbetter respond to the permutations of topic prominence. We also derive online inference\nprocedures based on a stochastic EM algorithm for efficiently updating the model\nparameters.\n\n\nThe third model is called the subjectivity detection LDA (subjLDA) model for\nsentence-level subjectivity detection. Two sets of latent variables were introduced in\nsubjLDA. One is the subjectivity label for each sentence; another is the sentiment label\nfor each word token. By viewing the subjectivity detection problem as weakly-supervised\ngenerative model learning, subjLDA significantly outperforms the baseline and is\ncomparable to the supervised approach which relies on much larger amounts of data for\ntraining.\n\n\nThese models have been evaluated on real world datasets, demonstrating that joint\nsentiment topic modelling is indeed an important and useful research area with much to\noffer in the way of good results.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chenghua, Lin","Richard, Everson","Yulan, He"],"dc:date":"2011-09-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, the climate of the earth is changing, affecting many biological systems, including coral reefs. Through this thesis the static and dynamic environment of the Caribbean basin was characterized using remote sensing and in situ data sources. This information was used to understand how present environmental conditions have shaped reef ecosystems and how the changing climate might jeopardize them.\nFocusing on physical constraints that drive many aspects of coastal ecology, a region-wide categorisation of the Physical Environments of the Caribbean Sea (PECS) was developed. The classification approach is hierarchical; including a first level of 16 physicochemical provinces based on sea surface temperature, turbidity and salinity data; and a second level considering mechanical disturbance from wave exposure and hurricanes. The PECS categorisation will facilitate comparative analyses and inform the stratification of studies across environmental provinces in the region. \nMontastraea spp. forereef habitats have the highest biodiversity and support the largest number of ecosystem processes and services in the Caribbean. One of the aspects of the physical environment, wave exposure, was used to predict the distribution of these habitats in the Caribbean basin with high accuracy (79%). The distribution of the habitat is constrained in environments of high exposure, a pattern likely to be driven by high rates of chronic sediment scour that constrain recruitment. This approach constitutes a fast and inexpensive alternative to traditional habitat mapping and complements global efforts to map reef extent.\nRecent changes in temperature have impacted ecosystem function across the globe. However, the nature of the responses has depended upon the rate of change of temperature and the season when the changes occur, which are spatially variable. In the Caribbean Sea, temperature trends are highly variable in space (ranging from -0.20 to 0.54°C decade-1) and most of the warming has been due to increases in summer temperatures. The highly detailed spatial and temporal patterns assessed can be used to elucidate observed ecological responses to climatic change in the region.\nIn the face of increased temperatures it has been suggested that reefs may become increasingly restricted to locations of naturally low thermal stress, such as upwelling areas. However, when analysing the degree to which seasonal upwelling reduces the local thermal stress experienced by corals, it is clear that upwelling areas do not always offer meaningful protection. Hypothesised areas need to be assessed individually in order to evaluate their capacity as a refuge against climate change.\nIn this thesis large progress has been made in assessing the ocean climate of the Caribbean basin by quantifying spatial patterns and their rate of change. Although some insight into the consequences of these seascape patterns to the function and distribution of marine systems has been provided, more can be done to fully exploit the datasets produced.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chollett Ordaz, Iliana Carolina","Mumby, Peter J"],"dc:date":"2011-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Comparisons of the behaviours performed during natural howling bouts and during howling bouts in response to experimental playbacks provide evidence for a range of howl functions including regular advertisement of the caller’s occupancy and mate defence and attraction. Detailed analyses of howl call acoustics provide the first evidence of both individuality and context-specificity in the calls of A. caraya males. These findings further support the functions of intergroup spacing, mate defence and attraction and suggest that howling may act as an honest signal of male quality. Experimental playbacks of conspecific calls stimulated howling by captive male A. caraya and affected other behaviour patterns suggesting that playbacks are an effective form of environmental enrichment to enhance captive welfare. However, the efficacy of conspecific call playbacks as a form of enrichment were not reflected in the opinions of A. caraya keepers surveyed: responses to the use of this type of enrichment were unenthusiastic, and the routine use of auditory enrichment for captive primates was limited. Analysis of the European studbook found that individuals housed in a family group rather than a pair, and those which are regularly exposed to the calls of conspecific males had higher reproductive success. Also, males who performed higher rates of howling had higher reproductive success providing the first evidence of a link between howling and breeding rates. These findings contribute to the knowledge of howl vocalisations in Alouatta species and the influence of captivity on a highly vocal primate species. From thesis results it is recommended that captive A. caraya be housed in social groups containing more than one male and one female and that the playback of conspecific male howl calls be introduced into the husbandry of groups to provide a more naturalistic auditory environment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Farmer, Holly Lavinia Antonia","Leaver, Lisa"],"dc:date":"2011-07-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Focussing upon the Communist-led railway workers’ trade union federation, the thesis argues both against monolithic interpretations of Communist activity during the interwar years and conceptualizations of Communism as a ‘counter-society’. Rather, it emphasizes the complex process through which Communists developed their influence and leadership credentials amongst the railway workforce. \n \nCommunists on the railways had, by the end of the 1920s, moved from an anti-system position to one marked by participation in railway industrial politics, albeit clothed in the language of class conflict. This was a consequence of the pursuit of a strategy which aimed to contest the legitimacy of both employers and trade union rivals to speak on behalf of the rank-and-file. To this end, Communists developed a pragmatic reading of rank-and-file expectations and a realistic assessment of railway worker militancy. This uncomfortable accommodation with railway capitalism, however, posed challenges to the self-identification of union leaders as revolutionaries. The situation was significantly altered with the advent of the Popular Front and the new collaborative politics of the years 1936-1938. Yet this period also witnessed continuity. The united and newly confident Fédération des Cheminots drew upon a decade of experience of engagement to significantly advance the power and influence of railway workers within the industry. The railway experience, it is argued, underlines a significant element within French Communist politics both for the interwar period and beyond.\n\nIn an industry plagued by financial difficulties, its future organization contested, railway workers were participants in debates of national significance. Examining how state, companies and workforce competed to define a modernization agenda, this thesis contributes to the historiography of politics and society in late Third Republic France emphasizing the innovation and creativity of the 1930s. Yet in highlighting the contested nature of trade union power and the changing dynamics of industrial relations through the interwar years, the thesis argues that political questions were central to organizational debates and that competing visions of the future of France were shot through with assumptions about hierarchies, order and stability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Beaumont, Thomas William","Thomas, Martin"],"dc:date":"2011-08-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In these numerical analyses, the behaviour of the actual\nmaterial is approximated with that of an idealised material that deforms in accordance\nwith some constitutive relationships. Therefore, the choice of an appropriate\nconstitutive model that adequately describes the behaviour of the material plays an\nimportant role in the accuracy and reliability of the numerical predictions. During the\npast decades several constitutive models have been developed for various materials.\nIn recent years, by rapid and effective developments in computational software and\nhardware, alternative computer aided pattern recognition techniques have been\nintroduced to constitutive modelling of materials. The main idea behind pattern\nrecognition systems such as neural network, fuzzy logic or genetic programming is that\nthey learn adaptively from experience and extract various discriminants, each\nappropriate for its purpose.\nIn this thesis a novel approach is presented and employed to develop constitutive\nmodels for materials in general and soils in particular based on evolutionary polynomial\nregression (EPR).

This thesis investigated factors influencing these two conditions separately, as well as the interplay between PCS and PTSD, in individuals with mTBI and a control sample without mTBI (orthopaedic injuries).\n\nMethod\nConsecutive adult attendees of an Emergency Department with mTBI or orthopaedic injury were prospectively recruited and completed the Rivermead Post-concussion Questionnaire (RPQ) and Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ) for PTSD at two weeks (T1) and three months (T2) post-injury.  The sample at T1 consisted of 34 with complicated mTBI, 76 with uncomplicated mTBI and 47 with orthopaedic injury, and 18 with complicated mTBI, 43 with uncomplicated mTBI and 33 orthopaedic controls at T2.\n\nResults\nAlthough there were no differences in overall PCS symptomology between groups, a subset of PCS symptoms (headaches, dizziness and nausea) was found to be specific to mTBI at both time points.  These symptoms are proposed to have a neurological basis, as opposed to a psychological basis.  PTSD interacted with PCS, particularly in mTBI, such that PTSD was associated with greater “neurogenic” and “psychogenic” symptomology in this group, but only a moderate increase in psychogenic symptoms for controls.  A model of the influence of PTSD on PCS is presented.  PTSD was influenced by poor memory quality for the traumatic event and attribution of blame to others, but not by mTBI.  \n\nDiscussion and conclusions\nThough mTBI may set the scene for at least neurogenic symptoms of PCS to occur, psychological mechanisms, particularly PTSD, have a significant role in the persistence of PCS.  Our findings suggest the need for a clear story and sense of meaning for a traumatic event for good recovery from PTSD.  Taken together, the results suggest that psychological interventions, particularly aimed at PTSD, may be most effective after mTBI.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mounce, Luke Timothy Allan","Williams, W.

There is vast international literature that has documented for many years the negative implications that stress and burnout can have on educators’ health and well being and the wider systems and individuals’ connected to their work.  The research also clearly documents that the development of school support systems can mediate the negative effects of stress for educators (Zellars \u0026 Perrewe, 2001).  Given that teachers are one of the UK’s largest groups of public sector employees (Bowers, 2001) and that the education system is once more in a period of rapid change, it makes this piece of research timely in the current context of education policy and practice.  This study calls for policy makers to recognise that stress in the education system is becoming an increasingly worrying trend and one that with the right kind of support systems in place could be alleviated in the future.  \n\nFocus of thesis\nTwo papers form this thesis.

The findings from the first paper informed my second paper.  In paper two I worked with school staff to develop and evaluate a support-based intervention in order to address the gaps in support that staff identified in the first paper.  \n\n\nThis thesis was conducted in a large secondary community college, with a specialist subject status.  This was located in a unitary authority in the South West of England.  All participants that took part in this research were employed as teachers, support staff and/or members of middle or senior management team at the school. \n\nPaper one findings\nThe findings in this study showed school systems to be complex environments, affected greatly by a range of internal and external factors.  Participants’ experiences indicated that stress and burnout are a function of the quality of work life in the education system for many, with negative implications associated with those closely connected to them and the education system.\nThis paper contributes to the existing body of knowledge in this area by drawing participants from across the school meso system, as opposed from one part of the system, ensuring that all those working at different levels within the school were represented.  A key issue uncovered by this study and adding to the existing literature in the field is the hierarchical nature of schooling.  This hierarchy served to maintain the causes of stress experienced by my participants.  These causes were systemic in nature as the issues raised were common across my participants and originated from the way the school system was organised and operated.  \nThe implication of this is that the focus of support needs to be aimed at adapting the school environment to reduce the main areas of stress faced by teachers and support staff and helping teachers to deal more positively with the stress factors within the environments and systems in which they work.  The evidence also showed that my participants had a limited knowledge of the wider roles of the EPS and this may be significant area for the local authority in which this research was conducted to focus on in the future.  This paper’s contribution is timely given the current context of education policy and practice\n\nPaper two findings\nThe focus of this paper was developing and evaluating, in collaboration with participants, a staff support-based intervention.  The staff’s support intervention of choice was a series of short training workshops focused on developing a better understanding of stress, promoting EHWB, assertiveness and methods of support.  \n\nThere were four stages to the creation of the intervention: Development of the intervention (through a focus group and the collaboration of school staff); Recruitment of participants (conducted through the senior management team through emails and staff reminders); Implementation of the intervention (five one hour, after-school workshops, using a range of teaching strategies, including practical skills; Outcomes (gained through an open pre and post training questionnaire which considered the practical strategies the participants had adopted from the workshop and applied to their practice).\n\nDespite working with staff including teachers, non teachers and senior staff to design the intervention, attendance at the after-school training workshops was poor, with only five members of the school’s support and special needs team attending.  There were no teachers or members of the senior management team present.  However those staff that did attend the training intervention provided positive feedback and found it useful in their practice.  The questionnaires suggested that the training increased staff’s knowledge of how to manage their stress and to promote their well-being.  Staff also stated that they were able to apply the practical strategies provided directly to their practice. \n\nOne of the main purposes of paper two was to begin the process of change in participants’ perceptions and practice.  As a direct result of conducting this piece of research the school of focus have set up a staff well-being forum, open to all staff, to meet on a termly basis to discuss matters relating to staff EHWB and support.  The school are also considering setting up staff consultation groups for the teaching assistants in the future, in addition to creating a staff well being notice board, a suggestion box, having a staff well being awareness day, creating a staff well being policy and also providing yearly drop in sessions for staff on stress management. \n\nThe role of the EP\nEPs are well placed to offer their services to schools in supporting them with examining professional support systems.  EPs are experienced researchers and could conduct small pieces of individual school-based research looking at those areas of the workplace where stress is experienced the most and be able to identify gaps in staff support systems.  EPs are equipped with the training and experience to provide bespoke packages of support for individual schools that may include staff training aimed at prioritising staff support and EHWB both in policy and practice.  It seems then that EPs are well placed to work in collaboration with schools to develop their staff support systems in this area of staff development and school improvement.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sidaway, Sarah","Tunbridge, Margie","Macleod, Flora"],"dc:date":"2011-08-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

CPs in preschool children are related to poorer educational and social outcomes in addition to a range of behavioural and emotional difficulties.   Although there is evidence for hereditary and temperamental influences, parental factors are widely considered to be significant in the development of CPs. \nParents experiencing psychological or social distress are considered to be at risk for challenging behaviour in their children.  Psychologists and other theorists have suggested several possible reasons for this association.  Firstly, it is possible that parents in distress have difficulty managing stress and as a result use harsh, inconsistent or coercive approaches to parenting.  Secondly, parents with children who have CPs may be low in parental self efficacy, a consistent belief in their capacity to parent, which leads them to parent ineffectively and inconsistently.  A third possibility is that parents in distress struggle to form stable attachments with their children which can lead to later behavioural difficulties.  Finally, it is possible that parent’s distress is influenced by external contextual factors which also influence children such as family or social conflict.    \nStudies suggest that training programmes for the parents of preschool children are effective in reducing child behaviour problems.  Training approaches are influenced by a combination of psychological theories including behaviourist, social-cognitive, attachment and ecosystemic approaches.  There have been many quantitative evaluations supporting the use of parent training programmes (PTPs).  However, there has been limited inquiry into the process of PTPs from the perspective of those who attend them.\nAims:\nThe first part of this study was designed to evaluate vulnerability factors related to conduct problems; parental self efficacy, stress and child behaviour problems over the course of a community parent training programme designed to help participants to understand and manage the behaviour of young children.  \nThe overall research aim was to evaluate the outcomes and process, using different methodologies to address several questions.  A realist methodology was applied to evaluating:  1. was there an association between parental stress, parental self efficacy and child behaviour problems at the start of the programme consistent with the established theory?  2. Did the parents attending the course experience higher than expected levels of stress and child behaviour problems? 3. Did quantitative and qualitative data indicate that these vulnerability factors changed over the duration of the course?  Finally, an interpretivist methodology was used to explore how parents of young children evaluated as at risk of challenging behaviour described the experience of learning in the programme.\nMethods:\nThe study utilised a pragmatic approach to evaluation with mixed methods and differing methodologies.   At the start of the programme, a cohort of 38 parents agreed to participate in the study prior to the programme and completed self report measures related to parental stress and parental self efficacy.  Parents with concerns about the behaviour of a child aged over three also completed a questionnaire relating to child behaviour problems.  Of the original cohort, 27 completed self report measures at the end of the programme.  17 parents completed the same measures at a follow up meeting at the Children’s Centre, five to six weeks after the programme was completed.   At this meeting 16 parents were interviewed to discuss their experience of the programme and any subsequent changes which had occurred.   \nResults\nThe results of the first part of the evaluation suggested a significant relationship between parental self-efficacy and stress and between stress and child behaviour problems.  However, there was no statistical association between self-efficacy and child behaviour problems, as expected.  This tentatively indicates that parental self-efficacy is less important in the development of child behaviour problems than has been previously suggested. \nThe analysis of stress data at the start of the programme indicated that the frequency of parents reporting moderate to extremely severe stress was 4.42 times that which would be expected in a typical British cohort.  At the start of the programme, frequency of child behaviour problems in the cohort were 5.9 times higher with conduct problems being 9 times what would be expected based on British norms.  This suggests that the programme is being accessed by parents whose children are evidencing behaviour problems and, in particular, conduct problems.  However, methodological issues are likely to have led to a slight overestimate of relative prevalence of child CPs in the cohort.  \nResults indicated that parents reported significantly increased self efficacy, significantly reduced stress and child behaviour problems, including conduct problems, between the start and end of the programme.  Thematic analysis and subsequent content analysis of outcome themes from interviews suggested that the majority of parents interviewed identified changes in parenting behaviour, knowledge, confidence, reduced stress and improved child behaviour as outcomes from the programme.  However, changes in the quantitative data were not observed as frequently, reliably or to the same extent in the interview subgroup as they were in the main cohort, suggesting a sampling bias or a discrepancy in findings between methods. \nThe self report data and interviews for all interviewees were then reviewed and interviews with six parents evaluated as having moderate to high stress, social or psychological difficulties and possible child behaviour problems were sampled.  These were then re-analysed using a rigorous inductive approach to Thematic Analysis to identify emergent themes relating to the experience of participating and learning through the programme.  Six themes emerged from analysis including; Understanding Difficulties, Identifying and Connecting, New Knowledge, Stopping and Thinking, Approach and Interaction and Reconstructing. \nThe Understanding Difficulties theme described the different ways in which parents understood of their difficulties relating to themselves, their children and others which motivated them to attend the programme.  The Identifying and Connecting theme described the importance to parents of personal identification with several aspects of the programme in terms of “being understood” in addition to identifying connections with established support, learning objectives and personal development goals.  New Knowledge was categorised into three sub-themes of theoretical, practical and contextual.  Contextual knowledge was constructed as understanding the experience of other parents, for example, identifying that other parents had similar difficulties.  Theoretical knowledge about child behaviour and development encouraged parents to “stop and think” about the reasons for their children’s behaviour.  Practical knowledge was constructed as parenting strategies which, when used, helped parents to feel more confident in themselves, more relaxed and more in control.   The Stopping and Thinking theme described parents withholding action and considering the motivations for their children’s behaviour or the best approach to interacting with them.  Approach and Interaction described changes to the way parents interacted with their children.  The parents in question described changed or reconstructed understandings of their children, themselves and their difficulties as a result of participating in the programme. \nThe theoretical implications of analysing the learning experience are that it highlights the importance of personal identification with the course objectives and experience.  Moreover, results confirm previous authors’ conclusions that individual reflection and new understandings are important aspects of parental learning.  Implications for practice with vulnerable parents include the importance of programmes being appropriately supported, relevant to parent’s needs and delivered in an appropriate context or through services with which they have established connections.  The use by practitioners of approaches to support reflective parenting may also be helpful in supporting better outcomes for parents considered at risk for child behavioural difficulties.","bibo:AuthorList":["Morgan, Geoffrey John Robert","Norwich, Brahm"],"dc:date":"2011-06-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

As a result, with more and more foreign invested enterprises in China, China has experienced dramatic changes in its economy and society. This study conducts an empirical analysis on the determinants of FDI regional and sectoral distribution in China and evaluates the impact of FDI on Chinese domestic investment. The dataset used for this study spans from 1990-2008 and involves both regional-level and sector-level data in China. The key findings of this thesis can be summarised into four points. First, on regional level, foreign investors base their investment decisions by tax rates, geography, labour costs and market size. Moreover, tax incentive effects are proved to be greater in the eastern areas than in the western areas. Second, at sectoral level, foreign investors are affected market size, employment, wage rate, exchange rate and state ownership degree, but not by the level of openness degree. Third, FDI has a significant crowding out effects on domestic investment on national level and in particular the eastern area, but has a crowding in effect in the middle area and no effect for the western area. Fourth, there is no significant evidence that FDI crowds out domestic investment on individual sector level.

Based on the texts of Bram Stoker’s Dracula and Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, these two films are an attempt to breathe new life into the original works, which have been diluted and over-layered with meaning throughout the mechanical age. \nIn the post-digital age, new aesthetic and methodological approaches to film production are emerging which are intended to humanise the digital by both embracing and countering the cold binary technologies that are dominating our lives today. Post-digital filmmakers are attempting to stimulate technology that no longer has any physical relation to the world and by doing so, are creating work that is more self-reflexive and immediate than ever before. Now that we are faced with these new post-digital dimensions, can we create new ways of representing the diluted texts of the past?\n\tMy PhD by practice attempts to answer this question by investigating post-digital aesthetic and methodological trends that have emerged during the past 15 years in filmmaking and applying them to my own adaptations of past texts. As a result, I have developed new ways of approaching my own work, which contribute to an ever-evolving practical discourse concerned with the humanisation of digital technology in artistic practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gaunt, Joshua Tristan Jamison","Hayward, Susan"],"dc:date":"2011-05-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In order to do this, constructs such as student-centred learning and critical thinking, as well as the teaching of English in a more communicative manner, have been promoted. \n\nThere has been little critical or grounded research carried out on the current English policy in Thailand, which emerged from the National Education Act of 1999 and the subsequent Basic Education Core Curricula of 2001 and 2008, therefore, in order to better understand how this policy works, this study explores how a group of Thai-English language teachers conceptualise the English language policy in Thailand by investigating their practices and beliefs (dispositions). In order to do this, and drawing on a social constructionist perspective from Bourdieu’s theory of practice, this thesis adopts a qualitative methodology that incorporates exploratory and ethnographic elements. Employing a combination of data collection methods that include classroom observations, retrospective accounts and semi-structured interviews, the findings demonstrate that a gap exists between the goals of the policy and what actually occurs in the classroom. Thus, there were few examples of either the communicative approach or student-centred learning being employed, with teachers instead tending to transmit knowledge to their students in a teacher-centred manner. Reasons for this may be due to the influence that the national examinations has on teachers’ work, the suitability and / or relevance of imported teaching and learning approaches on local contexts, as well as the need for better implementation of change. Teachers would indeed benefit from more professional development concerning the policy, but this thesis also argues that the policy itself needs to be critically examined. This would then allow Thailand, as well as other countries in the region, to better inform and improve their current education policies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fitzpatrick, Damian","Troudi, Salah","Levinson, Martin"],"dc:date":"2011-01-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Dialogic creates liminal space (Buber, 1965) where conversation generates knowledge and personal relations. I intend to explore these   ‘dialogic spaces’ where a group of 20 students and their teacher engage in dialogue around literary texts in an advanced  English composition and literature major class of female students of one university in United Arab Emirates (UAE). My study takes further, growing interest in the value of dialogical process in second language learning. It describes the ways in which learners engaged in dialogical process begin to challenge perspectives and power relations. Because of the positive response that followed the sessions (conducted for the pilot study), I wanted to explore the process in relation to gender and culture. My dissertation research takes further the questions raised in the assignment study.  I want to consider the conditions that will allow perspectives to remain in dialogue. My research explores how dialogic literacy practices function in relation to particular cultural and ideological discourses (Fairclough, 1992; Gee, 1996; Luke, 1991).  \n\nThe data include: class observations, field notes, semi-structured interviews (of students and the teacher) and writing assignments. The study employs an exploratory research design to discover and understand perspectives of the people involved (Merriam, 1998). I therefore emphasize that the analyses of the data are offered as partial and unfinished interpretations based on a specific theoretical framework. Although the research findings cannot be generalized across all female students in the UAE, they provide some insight into the learning experiences and preferences of Emirati women.\n\nKnowledge is finding light in darkness and staying warm in the cold. This is the knowledge our students must acquire. Not facts and theories, but a deep knowing (O’Reilley, 1998).

It examines those discourses that are related to these narrative passages by producing a comparative review of the  some widely used Qurʾānic commentaries—namely, those by Hūd ibn Muḥakkim, al-Ṭabarī, al-Zamakhsharī, al-Thaʿlabī, al-Rāzī, al-Ṭabrisī, Ruzbihān al-Baqlī, and Nisābūrī. It critically studies the conditions that influenced the interpreters’ prejudices and preconceptions. Also, this research critically analyzes the gap that exists between these Qur’ānic narratives and their interpretations. This research consists of five chapters. \nThe first two chapters deal with hermeneutics and narratives with respect to approaches and methods. The last three chapters are case studies, which explore the hermeneutical discourses related to these narratives. An analysis of the early methods of exegesis used on selected Qurʾānic narrative passages—conducted through the interrelated concepts of linguistics, grammar, lexicography, mysticism, history, textuality, and theology- will serve as the framework within which to study the level of understanding of these interpreters of the Qurʾānic text and their impact on the Muslim community. Critical research is conducted and primary sources are used to study how these exegetes understood the Qurʾānic text and contextualized the available knowledge to interpret Qurʾānic narratives on the literary, textual narrative, theological, and mystical levels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Troudi, Khaled","Rizvi, Sajjad"],"dc:date":"2011-07-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":2736527,"ep:Repository":45,"dc:type":["Thesis or dissertation","Doctoral","PhD","PhD in Economics"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Three Essays on the Political Economy of Public Sector Governance","bibo:abstract":"This Ph.D thesis is made up of six chapters: together with Introduction and Concluding Remarks, there are one extensive literature review and three main essays. The theme of this thesis is \"The Political Economy of Public Sector Governance\" and I explore it by analysing the two main actors in the interaction between citizens and politicians: Mass Media and Bureaucracy.\n    The World Bank in several publications since early 2000 has brought to the attention of politicians, public servants, social scientists and, as far as an institution like the World Bank can do, the general public that what really is important and does make a difference in the economic growth and social development of nations are not policies but (political and social) institutional quality. In order to make institutions work well, so they are able to promote the greatest welfare for all the citizens, it is necessary to have good governance. One of the ingredients of an optimal governance arrangement is the possibility for the citizens to make their government accountable for what it does (not) and responsive to their needs. Therefore, in order to have good political institutions citizens have, on one hand, to control their government and, on the other hand, to voice their needs, preferences and ideas, also when the ballot box is not ready at hand.\n    Mass Media has at least these two functions in the relationship between the citizens and the (incumbent) politicians.\n    In the first essay I analyse citizens\u0027 voting decisions and collusion between media and politicians and how this phenomenon affects the behaviour of citizens towards disciplining and selecting the incumbent politician, when citizens have at their hands two sources of information about the quality of the incumbents and their performance: the quantity of a good publicly supplied by the government and a signal coming from the mass media on politician honesty. The setting comprises a two period game, where voters, in the first period, have to decide, observing the information available through media and good publicly produced, whether to vote off or reelect the incumbent politician to the second period electorate mandate.\n    By employing both two signals, citizens manage to sort out honest politicians from dishonest ones more often than if they were relying on media information only. Moreover the existence of both signals makes collusion harder to achieve than in the case of one signal only. Furthermore, the welfare analysis reveals that, contrary to previous findings, the presence of media is not always welfare improving. The usefulness of media for citizens depends critically on the time discount factor between the two periods: when the time discount factor is larger than a certain threshold, it is optimal for the citizens to receive information from media; when the time discount factor is lower than the threshold, their optimal decision is not to get any information. Finally, I argue that when rules at the constitutional level are not possible and citizens cannot commit to have less information, then collusion between media and politician can be welfare improving for citizens, contrary to previous results in the literature.\n    In the second essay I investigate the role of Mass Media as a bottom-up way of communicating dispersed information from citizens to incumbent. Citizens transmit useful information thanks to the newspapers they buy and read. However, these newspapers are produced by a third party (a Media Tycoon) that has his own incentives. In particular the Media Tycoon has to decide whether to produce a newspaper that allows the citizens to participate in the public debate (Broadsheet) or does not (Tabloid). Given the fact that this instrument can be bought but not directly produced by the citizens, there exists a tension between the benefit of using a newspaper to express citizens\u0027views and the possibility that this newspaper can be actually produced. Results show that producing a Broadsheet always improves the quality of policy decision making on part of the incumbent. A notable result is that in order to enhance the quality of the public decision making it is better to have any Broadsheet than not having one, whatever is the public stance the newspaper takes about the issue at stake. In this essay I first assume that there is only one group of citizens which is interested in having the optimal policy adopted, i.e. the Middle Class and I assume the Middle Class citizens are the only one who read newspapers. Subsequently I analyse how the results change when citizens from the other classes read newspapers as well. I show how the \"partisan readers\", committed to buy the Broadsheet supporting the policy they prefer, can ease the production of the Broadsheet. In this case the existence of partisanship and of ideological readers make the implementation of optimal policy easier, not harder, contrary to conventional wisdom.\n       In the work of the World Bank, and in all the scientific production about how to establish and foster the development of good governance, corruption is one of the main diseases that can affect the correct relationship between citizens and public officials. So it is important to study how good institutional quality can fight corruption in several different fields of the political and economic environment. The third essay evaluates the effect of corruption on the regulation of business entry. A theoretical agency model of bribes is introduced, with strategic interaction between the firm, the corruptible public sector employee and the government. This model allows the evaluation of reforms targeting business startup procedures with regards to the incentives of the various actors involved in this process. Findings show that corruption in equilibrium between entrant firms and public servants could be self-sustained in the absence of government intervention. When deriving the equilibrium outcomes of some reforms like performance wages, privatisation and full liberalisation of entry, results show that transaction costs related to bribes are central in determining the optimal reform strategy. Although liberalisation is the preferred reform option for firms, government fiscal revenues and overall social welfare, firms surprisingly would prefer performance wages implemented in public registry service rather than the privatisation of this service. This holds despite the additional tax burden on firms necessary to finance higher civil servants\u0027wages.","bibo:AuthorList":["Scagliusi, Cosimo","Myles, Gareth D."],"dc:date":"2010-08-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This phenomenon has attracted considerable research attention, not least from those who are interested to describe the benefits seen to accrue from the opportunity this provides for an extended encounter with linguistic and cultural diversity. Notably, the widespread assumption that this can generate a new form of learning, commonly referred to as intercultural learning, which is understood to comprise increased tolerance, empathy and openness to the linguistic and cultural other. Despite the limited research data to substantiate these claims, among those interested to develop educational responses to globalization, the potential of intercultural contact to generate intercultural learning has considerable appeal and has been co-opted in the development of policy and practice to promote global citizenship at all levels of education. This has contributed to the emergence of a particular discourse about intercultural learning and is further fuelling the development of both short and long-stay study abroad programmes. \n\nThis discourse is, however, increasingly called into question on account of the perceived overly-simplistic constructions of interculturality and learning on which it is premised. In particular, there is a growing recognition of the need to develop situated accounts of people’s everyday encounters with linguistic and cultural others which acknowledge the exigencies of the setting, as well as the impact of wider political economic and historical discourses on their positioning in intercultural encounters. The generation of ‘thick’ descriptions of people’s lived experiences of interculturality in global educational contact zones, it is argued, can lead to a more nuanced account of the intercultural learning these can afford. This was the aim of the study reported in this thesis.\n\nThe study undertaken explores the relationship between an experience of interculturality and learning among 14 international students during their year-long sojourn at a university in the UK. Drawing upon a socially constructed relational understanding of learning informed by the transactional and dialogic conceptualization of learning developed by Dewey and Bakhtin among others, the study sought to generate a narrative account of participants’ experiences and learning generated from periodic individual and group interviews over the year as well as reflective accounts in participants portfolios and other opportunistic conversations recorded in the researcher log. \n\nPrimary analysis of the data revealed that participants’ experiences generated a number of forms of learning. One of these, ‘learning about self in relation to linguistic and cultural other’ was identified as a form of intercultural learning, comprising learning to be more open to the other and learning about linguistic and cultural positioning. This was subsequently explored in more depth, revealing a complex interplay between these two elements and the strategic actions taken by participants to manage their encounters with linguistic and cultural others. These results revealed considerable differences in the learning trajectories and outcomes resulting from their intercultural encounter. The findings also point to the importance of sustained commitment to intercultural dialogue on the part of individuals and the perception of their ethical treatment by others as important to the direction their learning trajectories take.\n\nOn the basis of these findings, it is argued that while an encounter with linguistic and cultural other may lead to increased tolerance, empathy and openness to other associated with the way intercultural learning is employed in much of the research literature, the strategic actions learners take to negotiate their linguistic and cultural positioning will critically inform the extent to which they develop these qualities. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the ways in which a situated and relational conceptualization of interculturality and learning is seen to contribute to a more informed and deeper understanding of the sorts of intercultural learning that are made possible by an intercultural encounter. I also identify a number of research agendas which can build upon the insights provided by the study.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rich, Sarah Alice Louise","Wegerif, Rupert"],"dc:date":"2011-06-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, in order to\neffectively conduct comparative research of public service institutions it is important\nthat some thought is given to how they can best be compared. Accordingly, it is argued\nin this study that the differences between public service institutions can be appropriately\nanalysed by examining their respective risk control cultures.\nThis study makes use of the grid and group cultural theory, as developed by\nMary Douglas, Aaron Wildavsky and Christopher Hood, to analyse the risk control\ncultures of the English and Japanese prison services in regard to two specific types of\nrisk, namely suicide and violence. The results show that particular patterns of\norganizational behaviour within the English and Japanese prison services can be\nidentified with their respective risk control cultures. More specifically, the English\nprison service tends to try to control risk by using formal rules and granting strong\nleadership roles to governors. By contrast, the Japanese prison service tends to use\ninformal rules and group pressures to control risk. Furthermore, the peculiar\norganizational patterns of risk control within both organizations are often not recognised\nby their members. As a result, the strengths and weaknesses of organizations can be\nidentified by analysing the patterns of risk control behaviour within them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nakamura, Ayako","James, Oliver"],"dc:date":"2011-09-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

If they are, how might these art forms best be protected by cultural policy and cultural economics? These were the key questions that we set out to investigate with the support of a Beyond Text grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council and with the help of our network members where together we formed an interdisciplinary team comprised of experts in copyright law, cultural policy, cultural economics, dance and musical composition. Through a series of interviews with musicians, singers, songwriters, composers, dancers, choreographers and others involved in the music industry and dance community we came to the conclusion that these types of works are both before copyright and beyond copyright. They are before copyright because what matters to the majority of those involved is the process of creation – which itself is constantly evolving – rather than the product – the protected work once fixed. They are beyond copyright because key aspects of the performance involve contributions which are not recognised by copyright, and because there is much about the performance which simply cannot be captured in the mechanical sense. As a result, policy intervention, which focuses on the product rather than the process, becomes problematic. This article suggests a series of practical recommendations made by our interviewees for ways in which the art forms may be supported into the future.","bibo:AuthorList":["Waelde, Charlotte","Schlesinger, Philip"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, studies from Oman, particularly with expatriate teachers, are still limited. The purpose of the current naturalistic qualitative research is to explore the factors that motivate and discourage expatriate EFL teachers in a public university in Oman.\nThe conceptual framework of this study is based on the Needs Hierarchy theory (Maslow, 1954) and the Motivation-Hygiene theory (Herzberg, 1976). An exploratory methodology was used, and the sample selected for this study comprised exclusively expatriate teachers whose average number of years of experience in Oman is 18.75 years. In-depth semi-structured interviews with sixteen expatriate teachers revealed several intrinsic and extrinsic factors that motivated teachers to work and live in Oman, such as, interaction with students, job security, and living in Oman.

This journey has highlighted the extraordinary power of the emotion of disgust to distort relations throughout the natural order. Utilising the phenomenological approach of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and the theological critique and insights of feminist theologies as well as the resources of contextual theological reflection, a new appreciation of the human body and body of the earth is sought by engaging more viscerally with the fears (and hopes) of flesh which have troubled the Christian tradition. It is claimed that the effects of human disgust have compromised Christianity’s life giving message of divine love and God given power of relationality throughout creation.\nIt argues for a deeper consciousness of the need for pyschic and social change in our human relationships, with each other and with the whole earth, believing this can be achieved through renewed ecomystical liturgy in the church, labelling and uncovering paralyzing fears so that the church could be seen as a beacon of hope and knowledge for all sentient life. A variety of methods to revitalise and empower liturgy are considered as pointers to enable the church to become an ‘ecclesial spa’ which would lead to deeper engagement with the often neglected physical realities within creation. The aim is also to help all those who suffer, to become theological agents of their embodied lives. The overall goal is to love at a deeper level those constitutive elements of the earth which sustain the world, before the disabled earth founders due to human indifference to both the\njoys and suffering of creation which, it is believed, are captured and held in tandem at the heart of the gospel of the incarnation and resurrection of Christ.","bibo:AuthorList":["Freeman, Doreen Patricia","Thatcher, Adrian"],"dc:date":"2010-02-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Observations from three service industries.","bibo:abstract":"Marketing literature has propagated “customer-participation” and “co-production” in the seller-buyer framework since the 1970s (Lovelock and Young 1979), yet marketing knowledge gaps exist in this area. Recent management research emphasise the need to re-evaluate how value is created for consumers and to consider the close nature of the interactions between buyers and sellers (Payne et al 2008). Vargo and Lusch’s (2004) proposed service-dominant logic reiterates this need, arguing that the “customer is always the co-creator of value”, as they are part of the system that delivers value.\n \nUnderstanding value co-creation is then important to management research, as it uncovers new opportunities to create “value” for customers. This also enables firms to formulate better pricing strategies. This thesis examines value co-creation attributes and how they may impact on the customer’s willingness to pay.\n \nThree studies utilising qualitative and quantitative methods have been conducted to address the research question. The first two studies employed qualitative methods to derive insights into value co-creation attributes from a comparative case study perspective under two different service contexts; the defence and healthcare industries. The third study, conducted under the higher education context, employed quantitative methods to gauge the impact of value co-creation attributes on the customers’ willingness to pay. \n\nThe qualitative studies found six generic value co-creation attributes, while the quantitative study empirically verified the importance of value co-creation attributes and the fact that they may impact on the customer’s willingness to pay for a service.\n\nThis thesis validates that value co-creation is important in service provision. As customers become increasingly informed and empowered, a deeper understanding of how customers co-create value with the firm is then central to marketing activities, specifically in how firms design and price their services. Therefore, this thesis contributes to marketing knowledge by proposing value co-creation attributes that have both theoretical and managerial implications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yip, Kwok Thye","Ng, Irene C.L.","Maull, Roger"],"dc:date":"2011-03-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It conceptualises a ‘theoretical spectator’ produced by the play texts and examines its implications for a politics of spectatorship in a postmodern age.  This methodology seeks to escape the trap of existentialist criticism that has dominated ideas on the theatre of the absurd since Martin Esslin’s coining of the term in 1961.  I posit the modern-day relevance of absurd theatre, by putting the plays under examination into dialogue with Lacanian and current post-Lacanian cultural and political thought.  The chapters theorise various ‘spectatorial positions’ produced by three prominent playwrights of the theatre of the absurd: Eugène Ionesco, Arthur Adamov and Fernando Arrabal. I seek to confirm and bolster my theoretical arguments by turning to contemporary empirical reaction to modern-day performances of two other absurdists playwrights, Samuel Beckett and Jean Genet. One of the key postulates is that the theatre of these playwrights chimes with Lacan’s notion of the split subject. Etymologically, the word ‘absurd’ refers to division; thematically and aesthetically, absurd theatre bears witness to the erosion of subjective stability.  The conceptual parity between Lacanian theory and absurd theatre permits me to stake out a new critical pathway with regard to this body of theatre that paves the way for its re-politicisation in a postmodern world.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cox, Lara Alexandra","Downing, Lisa","Jones, David"],"dc:date":"2011-07-25","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The relationship is studied in the light of events in Europe and the Near East from the 1938 Anschluss to the 1948 founding of Israel and the ways they impacted upon Jews in Britain. The work shows a positive reaction towards Jews in Britain, with few, but specific exceptions. Existing academic work has often concentrated on those exceptions, particularly in the East End of London. This study looks at the wider Jewish experience to show a more peaceful and tolerant coexistence than has formally been presented, especially to recently arrived Jews. The focus of the thesis is on the different personal experiences of Jews in Britain, against the more familiar high political context of the period. \n\nThe thesis does not dispute the existence of anti-Semitism, but shows that it was limited to traditional geographical areas and has been in many cases confused with a more general xenophobia towards any ‘outsider’ or ‘foreigner’. It also deals with what the study refers to as ‘pragmatic’ government decisions regarding Jews and highlights some non-Jewish reactions which have been seen as discriminatory, but in fact were often born out of naive ignorance or having no realistic alternative. Using different approaches to examine a wide and fragmented cross section of Jews, the thesis shows the internal struggle many faced when dealing with the issues of what it meant to be British, a Jew and for some, a desire to have a safe homeland in Palestine. Overall, it is a study in the transformation of Jewish society in Britain from being deferential and submissive to one of assertiveness and self-reliance born out of necessity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Burkitt, Nicholas Mark","Overy, Richard"],"dc:date":"2011-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The effect of\ntoluene doping was studied in detail and is explained by the electrochemical reaction,\nwhich takes place in the vicinity of the graphene and results in a gate voltage dependent\ndoping.\nSecond, the flicker noise in graphene and its relation to the scattering mechanisms\nwere studied. The flicker noise as a function of the carrier concentration was demonstrated\nto be sensitive to the scattering potential determining the resistance of the\ngraphene. Therefore, as it was suggested, the flicker noise can be used as a tool for\ndetermining the dominant scattering mechanism in graphene, although it was found\nthat the resistance and noise can originate from different scattering potentials.\nAlso, the flicker noise spectrum was shown to decompose into individual lorentzians\nat low temperatures (below ∼ 25 K), where the fluctuations of the resistance is supposedly coming from the random jumps of electrons between the conductive channel in the graphene flake and the nearby impurity states.\nThird, the transport properties of the bilayer/trilayer graphene structure were studied\nat different temperatures and different magnetic fields including the quantum Hall\nregime. Bilayer and trilayer parts of the sample revealed the signatures of the quantum\nHall effect predicted theoretically. The transport through the interface between bilayer\nand trilayer parts was also investigated. Signatures of the interface resistance were\nseen, although the observed behaviour is not explained. Under high magnetic fields\nthe properties of the interface longitudinal resistance were described qualitatively by\nthe classic transport equations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kaverzin, Alexey","Savchenko, Alex","Horsell, David"],"dc:date":"2011-11-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Young people’s experiences and understandings of the post-16 transition","bibo:abstract":"This thesis is concerned with the experiences and understandings of young people as they move from their final two years of compulsory education into a range of post-16 destinations including Further Education, work, apprenticeships and unemployment. The participants were all identified as being ‘hard to reach’ by school practitioners. The research responds to a need to deepen understanding of such young people ahead of the age of participation in education and training in England being raised to 18 in 2015.\n\nThe research was conducted in the South West of England. The empirical research was undertaken between January 2008 and April 2010 and comprised semi-structured interviews with 51 young people who were interviewed between one and three times during that period. The data presented in this thesis is focused on 11 of those young people who were each interviewed on three occasions. \n\nThe findings suggest similarities between the post-16 transition experiences of the young people participating here and those of young people in this age range, not identified as ‘hard to reach’. Notwithstanding these parallels, the research revealed that young peoples’ post-16 transitions and the aspirations they hold are often more nuanced than has been theorised in previous research. The findings raise questions about the implications of labelling young people, and 14-19 policy predicated upon assumptions regarding those who do not participate post-16. \n\nIn conclusion it is suggested that at a time of continued economic uncertainty and UK youth unemployment approaching one million , young people need more flexibility in the school and post-16 experiences that are available and actively encouraged, rather than increased levels of constraint.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, Darren Andrew","Lawy, Robert"],"dc:date":"2011-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The eponym of the ÍanbalÐ school (madhhab) of law and theology, AÎmad’s importance lies in his teaching as a jurisprudent and his practices as a zÁhid (renunciant), which attracted many students to his circle.  However, he is best known for his reputation as a defender of correct belief, and for firmly resisting the doctrine of three ÝAbbÁsid caliphs that the QurÞÁn was created, although he was imprisoned and beaten during the Inquisition known as al-MiÎnah (between 218/833 and c. 232/847).\nAs a result of AÎmad’s importance, a variety of different opinions and epistles were ascribed to him. Theologically, the most important among these are the Six Creeds and al-Radd ÝalÁ al-ZanÁdiqah wa-al-JahmÐyah which is a polemical epistle. In jurisprudence there were response collections from AÎmad’s students called al-MasÁÞil, eight of which are still extant, either partly or completely. These works are examined in this thesis.\nAÎmad’s theo-political ideas are critical to understanding the political thought of Sunnism in general, and the study analyses his doctrines on the importance of the JamÁÝah (Community), ÓÁÝah (Obedience) and al-Amr bi-al-maÝrÙf wa-al-nahy Ýan al-munkar  (commanding right and forbidding wrong).  AÎmad was a quietist thinker, but the main purpose of his quietism was in fact to save the unity of the Muslim community from internal fighting and protect the common people who always lacked security and suffered from threats of looting of their shops and houses. Though a quietist, AÎmad was not in favour of the rulers and avoided all kinds of connections to them, including not accepting their gifts or working with them. He became angry with his family when they accepted the caliph’s money.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al Sarhan, Saud Saleh","Gleave, Robert"],"dc:date":"2011-09-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A first-time adoption compliance review has been undertaken for the FTSE 100 non-financial IFRS 7 compliant firms. In contrast to prior studies, the results reveal that disclosure levels were high, and in some cases firms produce more disclosure than mandatorily required. As recent reviews of disclosure have shown, extant research lacks a coherent definition of quality that links to the original motivations for financial reporting. An argument has been built for adopting compliance levels as an appropriate proxy for the quality of disclosure. This study tests this definition via key stakeholders’ views both ex-ante and ex-post. A combination of content analysis of comment letters, survey data and semi-structured interviews was adopted. Though there is some evidence to the contrary, by and large, it seems that this definition of quality carries a level of integrity. Following this, a determinants study was undertaken investigating what factors drove the quality and quantity of these disclosures. It was found that higher levels of visibility (news stories versus analysts following), a share issue during the year and a higher volume of derivative assets held were statistically significant to quality. Those determinants significant to quantity were lower levels of managerial ownership and higher levels of news stories versus analyst following. However, of greater interest was the finding that the determinants of the quantity of disclosures were different to quality – and often in opposition. Thus, for the first time in a mandatory reporting environment, the findings cast doubt over the appropriateness of researchers adopting quantity as a proxy for quality. Finally, prior literature has shown that accounting standards requirements can be biased towards certain user groups as a result of the lobbying process. If this was the case for IFRS 7 then the compliance results presented could be unfairly skewed as proposals might be adopted to benefit those stronger lobbyists. It is pleasing to note that this study found that the IASB appears to have approached all groups’ responses fairly and appropriately. However, it should be noted that the evidence suggests that if the geographical origin of a response was from either the UK or from outside of the remaining countries of Europe and the US there was a significantly lower chance of the proposed amendment(s) being accepted. This study contributes to the literature by presenting results from a first full review of financial instruments reporting under IFRS 7, and by providing evidence that full, partial, non- and over-compliance are most likely explained by legitimacy theory, impression management and proprietary costs theory. In addition, this is the first study to review key stakeholders’ attitudes towards the financial instruments reporting requirements, thus helping to justify using the level of compliance as an appropriate measure of quality, whilst providing a cautionary conclusion about the possible inappropriateness of adopting quantity as a proxy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bamber, Matthew Alan","McMeeking, Kevin"],"dc:date":"2011-01-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Metabolite profiling and comparative proteomics were performed by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-QToF MS) and targeted analysis of plant hormones and flavonoids by liquid chromatography triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-QQQ-MS). These combined analyses revealed the effect of ascorbate deficiency and stress on metabolites and cell wall proteins.\nLC-QToF-MS based untargeted metabolite profiling methodologies were developed for analysis of metabolites on a large scale. Using this method about 3000-5000 metabolites (mass-retention time pairs) could be reproducibly detected in A. thaliana leaf extract and aligned between samples. Approximately 1000 metabolites were differentially expressed between WT and vtc mutants in different experiments. Of these, twenty eight compounds were confirmed to be differentially expressed by LC-QQQ-MS between WT and vtc mutants, and eight of these compounds were positively identified and validated with standards.\nThe plant hormones abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) have all been implicated in plant stress responses and differences in their accumulation in some of the vtc mutants have been reported. A systematic study of the response to stress of these hormones in several vtc mutants was carried out using LC- QQQ- MS. While some of the mutants showed increased SA and SA-glycoside accumulation, stress-induced ABA and JA accumulation was generally unaffected. Methods for identifying the metabolites in a targeted manner by LC- QQQ-MS was developed and were shown that all vtc mutants were impaired in the accumulation of anthocyanin in response to HL treatment. In strong contrast to anthocyanin, flavonol glycosides were not affected by ascorbate deficiency. Therefore, ascorbate deficiency has a specific effect on the anthocyanin biosynthesis.\nAscorbate occurs in the plant cell wall and isolation of apoplastic fluid showed that all vtc mutants have decreased apoplastic ascorbate compared to WT. Ionically-bound proteins were from the cell wall of A. thaliana leaves. Peroxidase specific activity in this fraction tended to be higher in vtc mutants than WT. High light intensity also increased peroxidase activity in WT and vtc mutants. To determine which peroxidase isoenzyme caused increased peroxidase activity, ionically-bound cell wall N-glycosylated proteins were isolated by Concanavalin A chromatography and analysed by LC-QToF-MS. Comparison of WT and vtc2-2 grown in low light and high light identified 937 peptides significantly different between WT and vtc2-2 and some are also affected by light intensity. Specifically, peroxidases 33 and 34 had increased abundance in vtc2-2.\nThe results show that ascorbate deficiency causes a detectable change in the metabolome of A. thaliana leaves, with specific effects on anthocyanin accumulation being detected. Ascorbate deficiency also influences the expression of cell wall proteins. Peroxidase activity is increased, and this response could be related to the increased pathogen resistance reported in vtc mutants.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sultana, Nighat","Smirnoff, Nicholas"],"dc:date":"2011-12-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":85343,"sim:weight":0.203354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631820,"sim:weight":0.189695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71821,"sim:weight":0.181733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631479,"sim:weight":0.180238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266520,"sim:weight":0.174147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108543,"sim:weight":0.159396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25887,"sim:weight":0.158595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76967,"sim:weight":0.156883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24544,"sim:weight":0.134034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26918,"sim:weight":0.131364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929927,"sim:weight":0.128899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222932,"sim:weight":0.128202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this paper is to explore the processes of Video Interaction Guidance (VIG).

It also examines what parents and EPs perceive as significant and helpful within the process of VIG. Results reveal that the interplay between the visual image and the nature and content of discussions appears to be qualitatively different when parents are more actively engaged in video review sessions. Parents perceived the intervention in different ways, which appeared to correspond with their level of engagement in shared review sessions. The limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed and the direct implications are dealt with in the overall conclusion in Paper 2 (pg. 93).\nAbstract\n\n\nEvidence suggests that Video Interaction Guidance (VIG) is an effective intervention that leads to positive behaviour change when used with parents and their children. This paper aims to evaluate the perceived impact of VIG when used with four parents and their children. Utilising a mixed methods case study methodology, it explores parents’ views of their experiences of the video intervention and examines whether any changes are maintained over time. Findings indicate that parents perceived some positive attitudinal and emotional changes. However, it was not clear that any changes were maintained over time and whether they could be solely attributed to the impact of VIG but were perhaps a result of a combination of other factors. A number of common themes emerged across cases that related to barriers and enablers of successful outcomes in VIG as perceived by parents and EPs. The direct implications of this study, suggestions for further research, and for Educational Psychology are discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gromski, Danya","Norwich, Brahm","Larkin, Shirley"],"dc:date":"2011-09-22","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The former theories focus on beliefs and attitudes, planning, intentions and goal focused actions. The latter focus on capacity to self-control actions in certain situations. Self-regulation theory considers the effort that people invest to control their own responses to achieve particular goals (Vohs \u0026 Baumeister, 2004). Within theories of addiction, self-control is fundamentally challenged. Incentive-Sensitization theory (Robinson \u0026 Berridge, 1993) suggests that cues become associated with incentive value and a sensitised motivational response. Despite the best of intentions to avoid a certain unhealthy behaviour, a learned automatic response becomes the norm. Only recently have aspects of eating become linked to addictive behaviour (Avena, Rada, \u0026 Hoebel, 2008; Benton, 2010) and the idea of building self-regulatory capacity is of increasing interest (Johnson, Pratt \u0026 Wardle, 2011). \n\nShort single bouts of exercise appear to reduce self-reported cravings, engagement in addictive behaviours, and salience of cues associated with the behaviour for smokers (Taylor, Ussher, \u0026 Faulkner, 2007), and rehabilitating alcoholics (Ussher, Sampuran, Doshi, West, \u0026 Drummond, 2004). Regular exercise may also have benefits on self-regulation of other behaviour (Oaten \u0026 Cheng, 2006; Ussher, Taylor \u0026 Faulkner, 2008). Studies of animals addicted to various substances also support the idea that physical activity attenuates consumption (e.g., Smith, Schmidt, Iordanou, \u0026 Mustroph, 2008). \n\nThe aims of this thesis were to examine the effect of a short bout of exercise on self-regulatory processes associated with snacking involving behavioural observation, self-report measures, direct and indirect measures of attentional bias. Also the effects of different intensities of exercise, level of stress, participant weight, smoking status, and period of abstinence were explored. \n\nIn Study 1, ad libitum chocolate consumption was measured in a simulated workplace (low and high stress situation via Stroop task). The effect of prior moderate intensity exercise (a 15 min-brisk walk) was compared with a passive condition in a randomised 2 x 2 factorial design, involving 78 abstaining regular chocolate eaters. The main findings of Study 1 were that the two (low \u0026 high stress) exercise groups ate significantly less chocolate than the passive groups. The manipulation of different stress situations did not influence the effect of exercise on chocolate consumption. \nStudy 2 and Study 3 involved a randomised counterbalanced cross-over design in which the effects of exercise were compared with a passive condition. In Study 2, the effect of moderate intensity exercise (a 15 min brisk walk) on self-reported craving and attentional bias (using a visual dot probe task, with chocolate and neutral images presented in matched pairs) (both measured before and after each condition) were assessed among different groups (normal and overweight people, and 1 day and \u003e 1 week (during Lent) chocolate abstainers) with a total of 58 participants. Exercise significantly reduced chocolate craving and attentional bias to chocolate images compared with a passive condition and the effects were similar irrespective of Body Mass Index and abstinence period. \n\nIn Study 3, given that abstinent smokers are at risk of emotional eating and weight gain, regular smokers and snackers were asked to abstain from smoking. Self-reported craving and attentional bias (using an eye tracking technology with short video clips) for both snack foods and cigarettes (presented alongside neutral images) were measured. The effects of two different intensities of exercise (i.e., 15 mins of moderate and vigorous intensity cycling) were examined among 23 temporarily abstinent smokers compared with a passive condition. The findings revealed that subjective snack cravings and strength of desire to smoke were reduced during and immediately after both moderate and vigorous exercise. In terms of attentional bias, initial attentional bias (% of first fixation) to snacking/smoking images were reduced after both intensities of exercise and maintained attentional biases (% of dwell time) to snacking/smoking images were reduced only after vigorous exercise.\n\nOverall, the series of studies found that a short bout of moderate intensity exercise appears to reduce cravings and attentional bias to snack-related food cues, and the effects were similar among different groups, different type/intensity of exercise, and different measures of cravings. The findings of this thesis have therefore suggested that compared with being sedentary a short bout of physical activity may help to enhance self-regulation of snacking among people with a habit of snacking, particularly with chocolate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Oh, Hwajung","Taylor, Adrian"],"dc:date":"2011-11-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In the current study, Arabidopsis thaliana ascorbate-deficient mutants (vtc1, vtc2, vtc3, and vtc4) were used to investigate the effect of ascorbate deficiency on the metabolic changes. \nNMR was used as an analytical technique for the metabolite profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana vtc mutants. A total of 45 NMR spectra representing wild type and four mutants of two different growth stages (rosette and flowering) were collected and spectral processed for exploratory analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate data analysis (hierarchical clustering) were used to find the differences between different strains and metabolite clustering patterns. Combinations of different parameters were used to find the best method for the analysis of NMR-based metabolites data. The method was developed which allowed making multiple comparison such as two growth stages and five strains. It was found the vtc mutants grouped separately from WT which contained the low ascorbate showing ascorbate deficiency might have some effect on the metabolic level.\nTwo interesting resonances 1.32 and 1.33ppm were separated which were negatively correlated with the ascorbate levels in the vtc mutants. These resonances (1.32 and 1.33) are putatively identified as threonine and lactate. Further investigations are needed to investigate the nature of relationship between ascorbate and threonine and lactate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Charles Johnson, Felicia","Smirnoff, Nicholas"],"dc:date":"2011-01-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

There is however, a dearth of information dealing with medieval Arabian-Persian-Indian seafaring in the Indian Ocean. Little focus has been placed on the language; in particular, the language of material culture or more specifically, nautical and maritime culture. The study attempts to understand medieval Arabic maritime terminology, the etymology, and the continuity of its use from the classical period to modern times. \n\nArabic literary sources: historical, encyclopaedic, geographical works, mariners’ travelogues and manuals are often our main sources for understanding maritime material–cultural terminology as Classical and Medieval Arabic Lexica are often void of definitions of material-cultural terminology. Hence, the study of maritime terminology in this dissertation is based mainly on the Classical and Medieval Arabic collection of mariners’ tales Kitāb \u0027Ajā’ib al-Hind (The Book of the Marvels of India) by Buzurg Ibn Shahriyār (d.399/1009). The study also compares the use of the terminology in this text to that used by contemporaries of Buzurg, namely the maritime travelogue/manual Akhbār al-Ṣīn wa l-Hind (News of China and India) (c.235/850), part of the work entitled Silsilat al-tawārīkh; al-Muqaddasī (d. 378/ 988-9) in Aḥsan al-taqāsīm fī ma\u0027rifat al-aqālīm (The Best Divisions for Knowledge of the Regions), and also the “Seven Voyages of Sindbād the Sailor” from the Alf layla wa-layla (Thousand and One Nights) of an unknown provenance and year. \n\nThe study focuses on the above mentioned texts alongside Classical and Medieval Arabic lexica including Ibn Durayd’s (d. 321/ 933) Jamharat al-lugha (Collection of Language), Ibn Manẓūr’s (d.1311-2) Lisān al-\u0027Arab (The Language of the Arabs) and al-Zabīdī’s (d.1791) Taj al-\u0027arūs min jawāhir al-qāmūs (The Crown of the Bride from the Precious Stones of the Ocean) as it determines which of the two resources is of more value in the study of medieval Arabian-Persian-Indian maritime culture and medieval Arabic material-cultural terminology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shafiq, Suhanna","Agius, Dionisius"],"dc:date":"2011-08-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108672,"sim:weight":0.370336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85242,"sim:weight":0.362167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108825,"sim:weight":0.35372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108374,"sim:weight":0.342396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108196,"sim:weight":0.297514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108728,"sim:weight":0.293384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108952,"sim:weight":0.274288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929878,"sim:weight":0.262493,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930470,"sim:weight":0.243226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108907,"sim:weight":0.220196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108154,"sim:weight":0.217842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108910,"sim:weight":0.187843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109149,"sim:weight":0.144721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84910,"sim:weight":0.144715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109153,"sim:weight":0.144438,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Specifically, it connects the execution and oversight of the General Survey in the northern and southern theatres, along with the intelligence it provided, with the actions of key decision-makers and influencers, including the Presidents of the Board of Trade (latterly, the Secretaries of the American Department) and key provincial governors.  \nHaving abandoned their posture of ‘Salutary Neglect’ towards colonial affairs in favour of one that proactively and more centrally sought ways to develop and exploit their North American assets following the Severn Years’ War, the British needed better geographic information to guide their decision making.  Thus, the General Survey of British North America, under the umbrella of the Board of Trade, was conceived.  Officially sponsored from 1764-1775, the programme aimed to survey and analyse the attributes and economic potential of Britain’s newly acquired regions in North America, leading to an accurate general map of their North American empire when joined to other regional mapping programmes.\nThe onset of the American Revolution brought an inevitable end to the General Survey before a connected map could be completed.  Under the excellent leadership of Samuel Holland, the surveyor general of the Northern District, however, the British administration received surveys and reports that were of great relevance to high-level administration.  In the Southern District, Holland’s counterpart, the mercurial William Gerard De Brahm, while producing reports of high quality, was less able to juggle the often conflicting priorities of provincial and London-based stakeholders.  Consequently, results were less successful.  De Brahm was recalled in 1771, leaving others to complete the work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Johnson, Alexander James Cook","Black, Jeremy"],"dc:date":"2011-09-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Although holiday decision-making has a long tradition in tourism research, the number of studies focused on how holiday decisions are formed within groups of travellers is relatively low considering the social character of pleasure travel. The majority of researchers continue to portray the individual’s holiday decision-making process at the expense of social interactions among group members. While research on family holiday decision-making is relatively well established in the consumer behaviour literature, the ways in which other decision-making units, such as groups of friends, make their holiday plans have been comparatively overlooked. This oversight occurs despite the fact that friends are common companions for leisure travel activities, especially for young people, who generally prefer to holiday with their peers. \n\nBased on empirical research through quantitative surveys (n\u003d412 and n\u003d200) and longitudinal in-depth interviews (n\u003d10), this thesis challenges the view that holiday decisions are usually made jointly, and instead suggests that specific holiday sub-decisions are often dominated by a single individual within a group setting rather than being equally influenced by all group members. The nature of joint decision-making is significantly related to the size and structure of travel parties; that is, decisions made by bigger travel parties, families and groups of friends could often be characterised as autonomic rather than syncratic decisions. Furthermore, group-based behaviour is a modification of individual behaviour, which makes individuals engage in activities they may not have done otherwise. Accordingly, compromise is the most frequently used ‘Non-coercive/Non-Confrontational’ conflict resolution strategy when making holiday decisions. The results of this thesis further show that tourist behaviour is highly context dependent, with external, situational and environmental influences, which mediate holiday decisions. Therefore, although the data demonstrate the existence of four distinct clusters of young holidaymakers, these segments are only representations of individuals’ attitudes and behaviours at a moment in time. A tourist’s identity is fluid and dependent on the context, which highlights the need for new contemporary perspectives on tourist decision-making.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marcevova, Kristyna","Prof. Coles, Tim","Prof. Shaw, Gareth"],"dc:date":"2011-08-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

While C. vulpis and E. aerophilus are endemic in foxes across the UK, A. vasorum is\nhypothesised to be spreading from current foci in the south of the country, warranting\nrepeated surveys of the fox population to monitor changes in distribution and prevalence.\n3. In this study we aimed to assess the change in range of A. vasorum across the UK since\nprevious study which used foxes from 2005-2006. We also aimed to analyse any changes in\nprevalence or associations with co-infection, fox condition and other factors since previous\nstudy using general linear modelling. Hearts and lungs of 103 foxes from four regions of\nthe UK were examined for nematode parasites. 23 foxes were from the English-Scottish\nborder region where A. vasorum has not previously been found.\n4. A. vasorum was not detected in the borders region, and had not significantly increased in\nprevalence in known foci. E. aerophilus was still the most common species found and UKwide\nprevalence was 62.5% higher in the present study than in previously study although it\nremains within the range of other European studies. There were significant relationships\nbetween fox body condition and E. aerophilus burden and A. vasorum presence, and\nbetween season and E. aerophilus burden. Presence of E. aerophilus was significantly\nassociated with decreased A. vasorum burden. These results differ from previous work\nfrom the UK.\n5. Veterinarians should be aware of the potential for northwards spread A. vasorum, and the\nrisks of infection from all three species elsewhere in the country. E. aerophilus may be\nemerging in the UK fox population, but future studies should confirm this using a\nstandardised methodology. Detailed study of fox density in different regions, and better\nsampling of urban foxes would also benefit future studies, while sampling of foxes from the\nborder region should be repeated to monitor spread.","bibo:AuthorList":["Brereton, Amelia Jane","Tomlinson, Alexandra","Bearhop, Stuart"],"dc:date":"2011-10-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The second section is a survey and anaylsis of Christian and Islamic voices in dialogue from the most recent century, comparing the two time periods and amplifying voices of ecumenical tone whose innovations and interpretations may without proper attention be missed by the academy. \nThe entire study concentrates not only on the ecumenical tones of dialogicians, but focuses on the interpretation of the Qur’an, highlighting key verses in the conversation. This study also amplifies the voice of the Qur’an itself in its historical context, as a dialogical voice. \nThis research finds that there is tremendous ecumenical ground between Christianity and Islam in the voices of their own scholars, extending from a period of declining ecumenism during the first three centuries of Islam, to a period of resurging ecumenism during the most recent century until now. This study also finds, highlighted among the ecumenical voices in the Christian-Muslim dialogue, that the Qur’an itself is possibly among the strongest of those voices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Block, Corrie Jonn","Netton, Ian Richard"],"dc:date":"2011-10-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Examining Gaskell in the context of Victorian philanthropy, I will argue that this is a relationship of far greater complexity than has previously been perceived.  Gaskell’s Unitarian faith will be of particular relevance as different denominations often had unique approaches to philanthropy, and I will begin by examining Gaskell’s participation with philanthropy organised by her congregation, taking the charity bazaar as my example of this.  Examining Gaskell’s three social problem novels in chronological order I will demonstrate that Gaskell rejects these forms of organised Victorian philanthropy, referred to as ‘associated philanthropy,’ in favour of developing her own vision of philanthropy in her novels.  I will examine how Gaskell’s participation with ‘associated philanthropy,’ and the individual pursuit of her own philanthropic interests, shapes the development of her philanthropic vision in her fiction.  I perceive her first novel, Mary Barton, as a tentative exploration of this vision, and by examining Gaskell’s three philanthropic novels in chronological order, I will demonstrate how Gaskell rewrites the traditional philanthropic relationship to offer a reciprocal form of philanthropy which has the ability to cross class boundaries in both directions.  I argue that Gaskell’s rejection of associated philanthropy was an integral part in the development of this vision, as inspired by her faith, she founds her own vision in a more personal approach.","bibo:AuthorList":["Armshaw, Louise Simone","Spencer, Jane"],"dc:date":"2011-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Yet despite this claim, there is relatively little focused academic literature on local government per se and its role in developing cluster-related innovation policy. The purpose of this dissertation is to help fill that gap by undertaking an analysis of how cluster-related innovation policy development occurs in the City of Toronto. The analysis focuses as much as possible on cluster-related innovation policy in order to differentiate it from other broader and earlier conceptions of innovation policy. \n     This dissertation makes two main research contributions. First, it offers a more focused critical empirical examination of cluster-related innovation policy development at the municipal government level in Canada through two Toronto cluster case studies, the Toronto Aerospace Cluster and the Toronto Fashion Cluster. The second contribution is the local government-relevant analytical framework that is developed which draws needed analytical attention to the particular interwoven dynamics of three variables involved, as a way of understanding cluster-related innovation policy development within two different kinds of clusters. \n     The primary research question explored is: How have the concepts and practices of cluster-related innovation policy at the local level changed in the City of Toronto roughly in the last twelve years? In order to answer this question three main arguments are advanced and examined. \n     The first argument is that cluster-related innovation policy at the local government level, though it has the potential for eventual success, and though it is often touted as providing a very effective mechanism for leveraging a city’s limited amount of fiscal resources, suffers from a lack of conceptual clarity because it is embedded in a range of other related policies described and promoted in other ways including economic development policy, prosperity policy, competitiveness, and industrial sector policies.                           \n     The second argument is that cluster-related innovation policy at the local government level is likely to have only limited efficacy and impacts unless there are explicit sources of multi-level governance financial support and strong multi-level governance coordination. \n     The third argument is that cluster-related innovation policy at the local level cannot be based on a one size fits all approach given that mega-cities such as Toronto face different challenges of scale and coordination, and given that clusters such as aerospace and fashion exhibit diverse innovation characteristics and coordination and cluster formation challenges.\n     A qualitative research methodology is employed which is built around the analysis of two case studies using both documentary evidence and sources and also confidential interviews. The first technique consists of a systematic exploration of existing documentation from the City of Toronto on their clusters. Federal and provincial documents are also utilized in the case study analysis. The second complementary technique employed consists of semi-structured confidential interviews. These interviews are used for a detailed investigation of participant views of cluster-related innovation policy, and policy processes, during the twelve-year period in the two case studies. The analysis is also placed within historical context through the development of two historical chapters. Two chapters showcase the development of these industries under earlier kinds of industrial, trade and social public policy prior to the case study analysis of each cluster.    \n     When the evidence for this first argument is examined, it seems to indicate that cluster-related innovation policy could have provided a very effective mechanism for leveraging the City’s limited amount of fiscal resources but fell well short of doing so, and thus this first argument is borne out empirically. The evidence for the second argument suggests overall that the federal government is not a focused cluster development player. Moreover, it is not engaged in terms of policy development, or coordinating policy development, among the three levels of government. Instead, the federal government tended to take a business climate approach rather than a focused cluster development approach, which does not help the city or municipality per se. The evidence for the third argument suggests that this argument is borne out broadly speaking. Several of the interviewees indicated that Toronto has to be treated differently when it comes to the development of such cluster policy, given the fact that it has to deal with issues of scale and coordination. And this does not mean just the City of Toronto proper, but also the Greater Toronto Area, the GTA. This is the case because arguably it is only in the major cities that one truly finds all of the necessary critical ingredients that can come together to produce a cluster-related innovation policy. \n     Thus the results of our empirical research clearly indicates that Canada’s innovation and related cluster policy architecture is going to have to change if Canada is to live up to its innovation policy and cluster development potential in the 21st century.","bibo:AuthorList":["Galvin, Patrick James","Doern, Bruce"],"dc:date":"2011-10-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Whilst most of the information on marine turtles has been obtained from nesting sites, turtles spend most of their lives at sea.\n\nThe conservation status of marine turtles in the southeast Pacific is poorly documented. This is particularly true for countries like Peru, where nesting events are very rare, although five species of turtles from populations from all over the Pacific basin, use these waters as foraging grounds. Little information exists on the threats to turtle populations in foraging areas or the magnitude of these impacts.\n\nSmall-scale fisheries are a globally important economic activity serving as a source of food and employment for ca. 1 billion people; however we show that they also have serious impacts on marine turtle populations from all over the Pacific basin in the form of incidentally captured marine turtles. \n\nThe five chapters that constitute this thesis are intended to increase our understanding of small-scale fisheries impacts on this taxon during their aquatic life stages. This work focuses on describing these fisheries, their impacts on marine turtles and proposes methodologies to monitor and assess the level of bycatch from small-scale fisheries. We also discuss alternative ways to prevent fisheries interactions and promote the involvement of artisanal fishermen in the southeast Pacific in implementing conservation solutions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alfaro Shigueto, Joanna Olga Gissella","Godley, Brendan","Broderick, Annette"],"dc:date":"2012-02-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

However, despite improvements in English language learning in primary state schools, no significant changes have been evident as regards the preparation of English teachers at this level. In conducting this research, my primary intention was to offer prospective and practising primary teachers a “voice” to express their own views regarding the content and teaching approach of a potential ELT module within teacher education curricula.\n\nThe research adopted a mixed-method sequential approach carried out in two phases between March and July 2010. Data were initially obtained from 296 in-service primary teachers and 124 student teachers through a questionnaire-based survey. Data obtained in the second phase through individual and focus group interviews with 9 in-service-teachers and 11 student teachers respectively were used to explain, interpret and further examine the findings of the survey.\n\nThe findings have highlighted the importance of theory and practice, showing evidence that both are necessary in order to avoid fragmented language teaching.  The study suggests, therefore, that providing student teachers with meaningful opportunities to form links between the taught theory and its practical application is a fundamental basis for a more holistic teacher approach to teacher education. This study has also provided evidence that participants view learning as a process embedded in a social context, within which knowledge is constructed through collaborative, awareness-raising tasks set by mentors whose mediating roles in the creation of desirable learning contexts is perceived to be crucial.  \n\n Although the findings of this research directly concern the Cypriot situation, they are likely to have broader applicability beyond Cyprus, especially in countries where early foreign language learning forms part of their educational agenda. Developing primary teachers’ language teaching knowledge and skills while considering the various types of support they receive during their pre-service education form part of a wider endeavour to ensure quality in early foreign language learning, an objective set by the European Union.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kourieos Angelidou, Stella","Cadorath, Jill","Wilson, Anthony"],"dc:date":"2011-10-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84939,"sim:weight":0.587701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108075,"sim:weight":0.564518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109069,"sim:weight":0.559612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821117,"sim:weight":0.508301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.45247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.448481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108417,"sim:weight":0.444315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85336,"sim:weight":0.406533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.379331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The reform has introduced innovative teaching methodologies, modern books, a new curriculum and the use of English as a medium of instruction (EMI) in mathematics and science classes. \n\nThe research carried out for this thesis investigated 11 Emirati female teachers. The data was collected from interviews and several informal observations carried out in a public middle school in a town outside Abu Dhabi city, UAE.  The rationale for this study is to critically investigate the effects that rapid reform is having on the performance of the female teachers in the classroom and the impact of this speedy reform on their professional and personal lives so as to highlight differences between reform theory and practice. This study is significant because few studies on female teachers in a Gulf educational reform environment have been undertaken and it is essential to uncover the foreign and non-egalitarian nature of the reform programme. Therefore, the study’s aims are to highlight teacher perspectives and teacher marginalization, EMI and consider whether the reform is being implemented successfully at the classroom level.  Of course, an important aim of this critical study has also been to raise the consciousness of those participating in the reform.  \n\nThis study has revealed mostly negative perceptions regarding the Abu Dhabi education reform programme, in particular with teachers’ perceptions of the work environment and the new pedagogy. It has also disclosed several instances of teacher marginalization as the result of a top-down reform and has exposed a prevailing sentiment of teacher disempowerment because of the presence of foreigners operating in the country. Teacher perceptions regarding EMI have been numerous in particular with cultural issues relating to the use of EMI in mathematics and science classes.

Most of the items are not signed by an author, and have no known record of publication or performance.\n    These technically anonymous items have received minimal scholarly attention in the three-plus decades since their recovery, and what comment there has been has not entirely agreed upon the collection\u0027s authorship, purpose, or even era of composition. This thesis takes a confident position on those debates by investigating the unsigned manuscripts and their contents through a variety of techniques.\n    This study reviews the collection\u0027s known history, past commentators\u0027 findings and conclusions, and the physical and textual properties, and comes to an authorial conclusion based on a fresh palaeographic investigation; it then offers a biography of the proposed writer. It statistically analyses the collection\u0027s material, palaeographic, and metrical traits, in search of trends that might show a development over time. It applies modern electronic resources to investigate the collection\u0027s textual interrelationships and plausible literary sources, and uses contemporary history and the proposed author\u0027s biography to suggest conjectural allusions in the writing. Together, those avenues of analysis allow for a best-guess ordering and dating to be proposed for the collection\u0027s contents. Turning specifically to the dramatic texts, the thesis then considers the proposed author\u0027s potential theatrical resources, searches the manuscripts for evidence of possible professional theatrical use, and gathers dramaturgical information from the texts themselves to form an opinion about how plausible contemporary performances would have been; this is supplemented with the findings from the first modern stagings of all of the dramatic texts, which establish what minimum physical needs the plays would demand in performance, and identify where there are dramaturgical issues that could limit the plays\u0027 theatrical practicality. The study\u0027s findings up to that point then allow for the collection to be positioned within their period\u0027s larger context of authorial and theatrical activity, conclude whether the writer achieved anything unique, and, identifying the collection\u0027s major recurring thematic elements, propose a rationale for the writer\u0027s authorial activity.\n    In summary, this thesis sets out to determine the conditions that brought the unsigned Castle Ashby texts into existence, and to suggest why they were written at all.","bibo:AuthorList":["Beattie, Luke Timothy","Mangan, Michael"],"dc:date":"2011-08-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Large amplitude magnetisation dynamics of a single square nanomagnet have been studied by TRSKM. Experimental spectra revealed that only a single mode was excited for all bias field values. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that at larger pulsed field amplitudes the center mode dominates the dynamic response while the edge mode is almost completely suppressed. The magnetisation dynamics occurring in a system comprised of two laterally separated magnetic nano-discs were also investigated. The polar Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect was used to measure the dynamic response of each disc independently so as to demonstrate that dynamic dipolar interactions between non-uniform spin wave modes in the different discs may be identified from the difference in their phase of oscillation. Results show a stronger dynamic dipolar interaction than expected from micromagnetic simulations highlighting both the need for characterisation and control of magnetic properties at the deep nanoscale and the potential use of dynamic interactions for the realization of useful magnetic nanotechnologies. \nTRSKM measurements were made simultaneously of the three Cartesian components of the magnetisation vector, by means of a quadrant photodiode polarisation bridge detector, on partially built hard disk writer structures. The rise time, relaxation time, and amplitude of each component has been related to the magnetic ground state, the initial torque, and flux propagation through the yoke and pole piece. Dynamic images reveal “flux-beaming” in which the magnetisation component parallel to the symmetry axis of the yoke is largest along that axis.  A comparison of the magnetisation dynamics excited with different pulsed excitation amplitudes was also made. The results shows that more effective flux beaming is observed for higher pulse amplitudes.\n\nLastly the microwave emission of Tunnel Magnetoresistance (TMR) nanopillars has been measured using a four probe contact DC electrical transport measurement technique as a magnetic field is applied in the plane of the film at different angles (ϕ_H ) with respect to the easy axis. Experimental spectra revealed that a more complicated spectrum containing several modes is observed as ϕ_H is increased. The modes were identified as edge and higher order modes from the statistical distribution of modes from different devices and micromagnetic simulations. The in-plane and out-of-plane components of the Spin Transfer Torque (STT) were estimated by analytical fitting of experimental data for the lowest frequency edge mode for the value of  ϕ_H where the amplitude of the said mode was a maximum and its frequency a minimum. The estimated values are larger than expected perhaps due to the macrospin approximation made in deriving the analytical model. \nThe results presented in this thesis can contribute to the understanding of magnetisation dynamics in industrially relevant data storage devices as well as the realization of a dipolar field coupling mechanism for arrays of nanooscillators.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gangmei, Prim","Hicken, Robert J"],"dc:date":"2012-02-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Overall, this  is intended to examine the role of faith-specific or tradition-specific assumptions and sources in shaping the stance on euthanasia that is taken by  certain Western Christian thinkers  and scholars in Islamic Medical Ethics. Following an initial overview of some of the central concerns of the thesis in the introduction (Chapter I), I will look at a range of select Western Christian perspectives (Chapter II) and certain Western and Eastern Islamic perspectives (Chapter III) on euthanasia.  In these chapters, I will investigate how various sources are used by particular Western Christian and  Islamic scholars to formulate their perspective for or against euthanasia.  In Chapter IV, I will compare the approaches of these Western Christian and Islamic ethicists to determine points of overlap and distinction. Based on this comparison, it may be contended that the Western Christian literature on euthanasia is in some respects more developed than the Islamic literature. Chapter V will take account of some of the types of argument that are found in the Christian literature but for which there is at present no fully developed counterpart in Sunni Islamic literature.  For example, the notion of respecting the elderly, as it specifically relates to opposing euthanasia, is discussed in the Western Christian ethics literature reviewed, but is not considered at least in Islamic Medical Ethics sources examined in this thesis. On this basis, Chapter V will offer an expanded Western Sunni Islamic perspective on euthanasia, which engages with strategies of argument drawn from the Western Christian literature, so providing a contribution to the literature in the developing discipline of Islamic medical ethics.  The conclusion to the study will identify the possibilities and nature of dialogue on this issue between faiths, and between monotheistic and other ethical perspectives.  So a secondary objective is to examine the possibility of convergence of thought among Christians and Muslims not just on medical ethical issues, but on a range of further issues from a Western point-of-view.  In this way, the thesis also aims to make a broader contribution to interfaith dialogue as well as the study of method in ethics directed toward a Western audience.","bibo:AuthorList":["Motlani, Rishad Raffi","Wynn, Mark Robert"],"dc:date":"2011-08-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":2736657,"ep:Repository":45,"dc:type":["Thesis or dissertation","Doctoral","PhD","PhD in Politics"],"bibo:shortTitle":"China, Pariah Status and International Society","bibo:abstract":"Pariah status in international society denotes an international social hierarchy and differentiation of states caused by power differentials between state groups along the material and normative spectrums. From the late Qing era to the present day, China’s engagement with international society has largely been marked by a sharp fall from the ‘Middle Kingdom’ to a pariah, followed by a recent rise to great power status.  This thesis traces and analyses China’s experience as a pariah in international society since 1839, and explains China’s responses to the normative boundaries and behavioural standards set by members of international society. To this end, this thesis addresses two themes. \n\nTheme One (Chapter 1, 2, 3, 4) provides an account of the sociological history of pariah state, on which basis it conducts an empirical study on China’s pariah past.  Theme Two (Chapter 5) brings in a sociological account of status to understand the fall and rise of states (particularly that of China), and to explain state responses to the normative boundaries alongside their status change in international society. Moreover, it challenges the material-power based power transition theory on China’s rise and destiny, and argues for an alternative status-led account. In general, this thesis resonates greatly with English School theorists and social constructivists in terms of the understanding of and approach towards international relations. In a broad sense, it adopts a combined sociological and historical approach towards the study of the international, specifically that of pariah and status.\n\nThe main contentions of this thesis are: first, pariah is a social, relational and historically contingent term. Pariah states are socially made through a process of rule making, rule-application, and behaviour-judging, with the rule-makers being those who are positioned at the higher ends of both material and normative power spectrums. The criteria for pariah are not fixed, but subject to change as they are conditioned by the changing international normative/material structures and dynamics among actors. Second, state status has both material and social implications in international society. It derives from the internal/domestic attributes of the state as well as the external/international. The attainment of status hinges upon material power capacity, state identity, behavioural legitimacy, and international perception thereof. Third, empirically, the fall and rise of China in international society is not merely a process of China’s material power decline and elevation relative to others, but was also accompanied by its social mobility downward and upward. China’s responses to the international normative boundaries are not purely determined by material power incentives. Instead, it is the complex interplay between the material and the social that accounts for China’s constant struggle between compliance with the standardised behavioural codes prescribed in the standard of civilisation, and attempts to contest them by inserting its own civilisational values.","bibo:AuthorList":["Li, Meiting","Dunne, Tim","Wight, Colin"],"dc:date":"2012-01-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

One area of growing concern has been for the impacts of small-scale fisheries on these species. Over the past decade it has become increasingly clear that these under-studied fisheries have sizeable levels of catch and bycatch of many threatened and endangered species of sea turtles, seabirds and small cetaceans. This thesis presents a collection of chapters that investigate aspects related to the interactions of small-scale fisheries with threatened marine vertebrates. \n\nWe identify sizeable rates of bycatch of small cetaceans and seabirds for multiple small-scale longline and gillnet fisheries in both Peru and Ecuador. Catch rates of small cetaceans by the Peruvian small-scale driftnet fleet are estimated to exceed 10,000 dolphins and porpoises annually. A trial of acoustic alarms (pingers) in this same fishery showed a 37% reduction in small cetacean bycatch while not reducing target catch and represents a promising bycatch mitigation measure. Seabird bycatch was also found to be high in both longline and gillnet fisheries and included a wide range of seabird species including the critically endangered waved albatross (Phoebastria irrorata). Through post-capture satellite tracking of loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) we show that these turtles are present in pelagic waters off the coasts of Peru and Chile for extended periods during which they are at risk of repeat interactions with small-scale longline fisheries operating throughout their foraging habitat. Through scan and focal sampling of the endangered marine otter (Lontra felina) we also show that otters making den sites in human fishing communities face additional risks due to entanglement in fishing gear or interactions with feral animals but, if properly managed, these sites could serve as stepping stones for marine otters along the coast.\n\nThe results presented here, gathered using a wide range of techniques, including onboard observer and shore-based monitoring, satellite tracking, bycatch quantification, and bycatch mitigation experiments, represent an attempt to better characterize and quantify the interactions of small-scale fisheries with threatened marine vertebrates toward identifying solutions that can lead to sustainable fisheries and populations of these protected marine species.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mangel, Jeffrey Charles","Godley, Brendan"],"dc:date":"2012-02-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84300,"sim:weight":0.616074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9521,"sim:weight":0.338929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84275,"sim:weight":0.277532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513386,"sim:weight":0.208027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29919,"sim:weight":0.189613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14691,"sim:weight":0.175475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.150102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84263,"sim:weight":0.141482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, with both age and gender acting as possible risk factors, the incidence of running related injuries and associated conditions is high among this group. With the predominance of debilitating conditions such as knee joint osteoarthritis acting at the knee joint, knowledge of lower limb biomechanics during running will provide insight into possible risk factors and potential management strategies. Three biomechanical and one magnetic resonance imaging study focussed on the specific running gait of mature females and the effect of footwear on lower limb joint kinematics and loading. The biomechanical studies used synchronised ground reaction force and lower extremity kinematic data to provide three dimensional running data and knee moments for each female. The long term study objectives were to 1) determine whether the running gait of mature females could be a predisposing factor to injuries and conditions at the knee joint, and 2) determine if changes in footwear could modify biomechanical variables associated with the development of injuries and overuse conditions among this group.\nIn Study One, a direct comparison of mature and young female running gait was used to identify any biomechanical movement characteristics specific to the mature group that could predispose to injuries and debilitating conditions. It was found that rearfoot eversion, ankle dorsiflexion, knee internal rotation, and knee external adductor moment that are associated with increased loading of the lateral knee joint and possible medial knee joint osteoarthritis development, were significantly higher among the mature females compared to the younger group (p\u003c0.05).\nA common management strategy for running related conditions is the adaption of footwear. Therefore Study Two investigated the effect of a motion control running shoe on the running gait of young and mature females, with a specific focus on the variables associated with knee joint injury and osteoarthritis development. The results showed a motion control shoe to reduce certain biomechanical variables (rearfoot eversion and knee internal rotation) associated with mature female runners. However, one variable (knee external adductor moment) commonly associated with increased medial knee loading and osteoarthritis development, remained high among the mature females.\nOne specific method used to reduce the knee external adductor moment, is the implementation of a lateral wedge in running shoes. Therefore, Study Three assessed the singular effects of a medial wedge, a lateral wedge, and then the effect of an orthotic combining both interventions on the running gait of mature females. Results demonstrated non significant changes in any kinematic variable with the medial or lateral wedge, although the lateral wedge was shown to reduce the knee external adductor moment. The orthotic intervention however produced significant reductions in rearfoot eversion, knee internal rotation, and knee external adductor moment previously found to be high among mature female runners.\nAlthough all mature females studied had previously been characterised as free from symptoms of knee injury or osteoarthritis, a final investigation was undertaken to assess the condition of the knee joint (Study Four). Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the knee were taken for ten of the mature females. Results indicated that eight out of the ten females had early stage osteoarthritis present, with an average 79% of features presenting on the medial side of the knee joint. Additionally, there was a strong positive correlation between knee osteoarthritis and the knee external adductor moments measured in the ongoing biomechanical study (Study Three).\nThese studies have shown that the running gait of mature females is significantly different to that of younger female runners, and could predispose the mature group to injury and knee osteoarthritis development. The trends in kinematic adaption to a motion control shoe have shown promising results, and indicated the potential for footwear to reduce rearfoot eversion and knee internal rotation among mature female runners. However, a specific orthotic, incorporating both medial and lateral support has been found to reduce biomechanical features of gait associated with overloading at both the medial and lateral knee joint. The positive correlation between the knee adductor moment and signs of osteoarthritis for an asymptomatic population suggests that the knee adductor moment may be a useful predictive tool for identifying female runners at risk of osteoarthritis development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lilley, Kim Louise","Dixon, Sharon","Stiles, Vicky"],"dc:date":"2012-02-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Following the concept across disciplinary boundaries, from a longue durée history perspective, it explores how virulence was shaped through two distinct, although sometimes overlapping, “styles of reasoning”. Located at the intersection of several distinct research domains in biology and medicine, the concept of virulence provides, in addition, a window into the complex and changing relations between evolutionary biology and the health sciences (broadly construed) over the past two centuries. Moving back and forth between field experiments and the laboratory, this work examines, through the lens of historical epistemology, the emergence of what I call the molecular and the ecological styles, and their respective conceptual practices. It focuses on the ways in which these styles operationalize the distinction between virulent or avirulent organisms in sometimes opposite sense: Whereas in the molecular (or endogenous) style the expression of virulence is explained by properties of internal structures of the infectious agent (e.g. polysaccharide capsule, virulence gene, or pathogenicity island), the concept of virulence in the ecological (or exogenous) style reflects, in contrast, either a lack of adaptation between two species (avirulence hypothesis) or the existence of one or more ecological compromises between, say, the mode of transmission of a pathogen and its host’s recovery rate (trade-off model). Both styles can be said to originate in the medical bacteriology of the late-nineteenth century, but while the former grew mostly out of the work of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch in Europe, the latter was primarily shaped by Theobald Smith in the United States. Nearly a century later, the introduction of the category of emerging infectious disease within public health discourses in the mid-1990s facilitated a rapprochement between the two styles that had, so far, remained apart. Employing the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic as an example in which to illustrate the trajectory of the molecular and the ecological approaches, the diversity of explanatory schemes developed to account for the pandemic’s exceptional virulence points toward an unresolved, and yet productive, epistemic tension between the two styles, on the one hand, and the intrinsic polarity of the concept of virulence itself, on the other.","bibo:AuthorList":["Methot, Pierre-Olivier","Dupré, John","Müller-Wille, Staffan","Gayon, Jean"],"dc:date":"2011-12-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

One\nsuch mechanism is the use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to automatically develop\nrobot controllers and occasionally, robot morphology. This area of research is referred\nto as evolutionary robotics (ER). Through the use of evolutionary techniques such as\ngenetic algorithms (GAs) and genetic programming (GP), ER has shown to be a promising\napproach through which robust robot controllers can be developed.            \nThe standard ER techniques use monolithic evolution to evolve robot behaviour: monolithic\nevolution involves the use of one chromosome to code for an entire target behaviour.\nIn complex problems, monolithic evolution has been shown to suffer from bootstrap problems;\nthat is, a lack of improvement in fitness due to randomness in the solution set\n[103, 105, 100, 90]. Thus, approaches to dividing the tasks, such that the main behaviours\nemerge from the interaction of these simple tasks with the robot environment\nhave been devised. These techniques include the subsumption architecture in behaviour\nbased robotics, incremental learning and more recently the layered learning approach\n[55, 103, 56, 105, 136, 95]. These new techniques enable ER to develop complex controllers\nfor autonomous robot.           Work presented in this thesis extends the field of evolutionary robotics by introducing Gene\nExpression Programming (GEP) to the ER field. GEP is a newly developed evolutionary\nalgorithm akin to GA and GP, which has shown great promise in optimisation problems.\nThe presented research shows through experimentation that the unique formulation of\nGEP genes is sufficient for robot controller representation and development. The obtained\nresults show that GEP is a plausible technique for ER problems. Additionally, it is shown\nthat controllers evolved using GEP algorithm are able to adapt when introduced to new\nenvironments.\nFurther, the capabilities of GEP chromosomes to code for more than one gene have been\nutilised to show that GEP can be used to evolve manually sub-divided robot behaviours.\nAdditionally, this thesis extends the GEP algorithm by proposing two new evolutionary\ntechniques named multigenic GEP with Linker Evolution (mgGEP-LE) and multigenic\nGEP with a Regulator Gene (mgGEP-RG). The results obtained from the proposed algorithms\nshow that the new techniques can be used to automatically evolve modularity\nin robot behaviour. This ability to automate the process of behaviour sub-division and\noptimisation in a modular chromosome is unique to the GEP formulations discussed, and\nis an important advance in the development of machines that are able to evolve stratified\nbehavioural architectures with little human intervention.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mwaura, Jonathan","Keedwell, Edward"],"dc:date":"2011-12-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Using a theoretic construct presented in the area of philosophy in the 1990s by cognitive theorist Gilles Fauconnier called ‘mental space’, a concept exploring a person’s natural inclination to construct a comprehensible idealized cognitive model (ICM) of any given situation in order to understand his or her role in it (Fauconnier 1994:8), I examine how Fauconnier’s concept can be applied to building a film narrative and specifically how it can be applied to a screenwriter’s understanding and breaking down of the components of film genre. I also employ the work of scholars focused on the audience’s reception, especially the reception of film genre.  In the practical section of my practice-led PhD, the writing of the first acts of three screenplays that share location, similar core cast of characters and plot points but are constructed in three distinctly different film genres (western, horror, romantic comedy), I endeavor to apply elements I have termed the ‘mental space of film genre’ in order to determine the adjustments and changes necessary to move narrative from one genre to another in order to fulfill various genre perimeters and genre expectations.

Its focus is on the political emergence of ‘Muslim-Democrat’ parties. This term was coined by the scholar Vali Nasr and refers to a new sub-type of party actor in the spectrum of political Islam that employs Islamic religiousity in its electoral appeal but operates within the normative framework of liberal democracy. The central question driving this thesis is to uncover how Turkey’s Muslim-Democrat parties have had a positive effect in advancing the institutionalization of Turkey’s party system. This thesis attempts to contribute to the broader debate regarding the compatibility of Islamist parties and democratic politics in demonstrating that the former, when adopting a moderate format akin to the ‘Muslim-Democrat’ ideal type, can have a positive effect in advancing processes of party system institutionalization. This effect would then be critically discussed within the context of its impact on broader democratic consolidation. The AKP, Turkey’s incumbent party, is chosen as the case study of a Muslim Democrat party. \n\nThe theoretical basis for the empirical element of this thesis is informed by the research  framework for party system institutionalization that was formulated by Mainwaring and Scully in the context of Latin American ‘third-wave’ democracies. They posit four specific factors to examine the institutional strengths of democratic party systems. This framework is used to examine the development of the Turkish party system and the impact of the Islamist parties, especially Muslim-Democrat parties, on these processes. The bulk of this thesis uses statistical analyses of aggregate electoral as well as attitudinal survey data as well as examining the political discourse of the election manifestoes of Turkey’s Islamist and Muslim-Democrat parties using content analysis as well as discourse analysis. The findings of this analysis conclude that Muslim-Democrat parties like the AKP have indeed contributed towards party system institutionalization in Turkey both in terms of stabilizing inter-party competition and social rootedness as well as increasing the legitimacy of democratic civilian politics. In that sense, their effect on party system institutionalization has had a beneficial effect on Turkey’s democratic consolidation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Herzog, Marc","Banducci, Susan"],"dc:date":"2011-05-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The research question is how (if at all) do primary school pupils change following a residential adventure education experience, how does any change relate to their experience during the residential and what implications does that have for the provision of residential adventure education?\n\nIt is a three phase study.  Phase 1 is quantitative: a survey to assess whether there is a correlation between the extent of residential opportunities and whole school performance measures.  Phase 2 is qualitative: a series of interviews with headteachers, parents and policy makers to discover their perceptions of the impact of a residential programme.  Phase 3 is quantitative: designing and testing an instrument to measure the impact on pupils of different aspects of a residential programme and comparing this with their classroom attainment and their social and emotional development.\n\nNo relationship was found between the extent of residential opportunities and whole school performance measures, although it was found that opportunities are inversely correlated with deprivation.  \n\nInterview data produced a rich source of evidence for the way in which different aspects of a course combine together to produce a powerful impact.  Complexity theory was used as a theoretical perspective to suggest that a non-linear step change in self-confidence could arise naturally and possibly inevitably as a result of the fact that residential adventure education is a complex system.\n\nAnalysis of the pupil impact survey showed that many different aspects of the experience combine to create the impact but that it can reliably be separated into four components: living with others, challenge, teacher relationships and learning about self.  There was a significant correlation between the improvement in individual pupils’ classroom attainment over the course of a term and the impact that the residential had on them.  There was a significant improvement from pre-course to post-course in pupils’ prosocial behaviour and a significant reduction in perceived hyperactivity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Randall","Postlethwaite, Keith","Osberg, Deborah"],"dc:date":"2012-01-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Positive associations between bite wounding and disease status in the Eurasian badger Meles meles have led to the suggestion of bite wounding as an alternative route of Mycobacterium bovis (bovine TB) infection to aerosol infection of the respiratory system. Understanding the social behaviours behind transmission routes is important for the effective management of infection. This study investigated the incidence of bite wounding in a naturally infected badger population with regard to (1) the evidence for bite wounding as a route of bovine TB transmission between badgers, and (2) the social behaviour of infected and uninfected animals. The results were consistent with bite wounding being a true route of transmission: M. bovis infected bite wounds were randomly distributed across all body locations, independently of those locations normally associated with respiratory infection, and positively associated with the incident event of bovine TB infection in badgers, with no association to positive respiratory-related cultures. Badgers with established disease (as detected by microbiological culture) were more likely to have bite wounds than those that were culture negative, which may be a reflection of abnormal increased ranging behaviour of infected badgers. Both bite wound infected individuals and infected individuals with bites may be important for bovine TB transmission to cattle and should be taken into consideration when planning a bovine TB management programme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Daines, Rosie Laura","Bearhop, Stuart"],"dc:date":"2011-10-18","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The empirical chapters take a different theoretical body of literature to demonstrate the extent to which mediation alters human perception. The thesis is informed by research participants who took part in an experimental visual methodology that sought to open up new ways of studying the senses.  The empirical chapters cover a consideration of the phasing in and out of attention of equipmental prosthetics for learner divers, a phenomenological study of the reorganisation of the senses underwater, a Bergsonian take on the intersubjective nature of recollection upon encountering material relics at a wreck site. The construction of docile diving bodies are considered, in relation to appropriate ways of moving and thinking about the ocean’s inhabitants, before the final empirical chapter outlines the mediative role of videographic souvenirs, as they polish memories of previous experience and alter relations to place. The thesis concludes by drawing attention to the way in which understandings of underwater space are constructed before, during and after real-time perception of the ocean and its various inhabitants. Consequently, it is noted that underwater experience is both highly subjective and intertextual, being furnished by the associations and atmospheres that each learner diver brings to the encounter and being re-presented to others by means of what each diver takes away.","bibo:AuthorList":["Merchant, Stephanie","Cloke, Paul"],"dc:date":"2012-01-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The primary focus of this thesis is the large number of unaccompanied children who were officially evacuated to the County under the auspices of the Government Evacuation Scheme during the Second World War.  However, Chapter Six discusses the evacuation of mothers and accompanying children, unofficial (private) evacuees and private school parties.  The majority of evacuated children arriving in Devon originated from the London area and southeastern counties.  In addition large numbers of children were also evacuated to the County from Bristol and within the County from Plymouth (Devon) during 1941 and briefly from Exeter in May 1942.  Each of the three national evacuation waves is considered individually throughout the text as they are quite distinct in complexion, a fact frequently ignored in generalised accounts which tend to focus on reaction to the initial wave.  \n\nThis thesis argues that:\n                     1. lack of regional and local research has resulted in evacuation largely being viewed in generalised and stereotypical terms without due regard for the socioeconomic and geopolitical variance between those areas involved or the particular localised features of the evacuation process\n                     2. the acclimatisation of evacuated children was particularly successful in Devon and drift back less than the national average\n                     3. local evidence supports the argument that contemporary national reports of impoverished, dirty and ill mannered evacuees were frequently exaggerated\n                     4. evacuation was central in accelerating postwar reform in areas of education, child care and welfare \nThe civilian evacuation during World War Two was a remarkable event in the history of modern Britain.  Interest in the subject has recently increased but there is enormous scope and need for further research both to broaden our understanding of the nature and impact of evacuation and to test entrenched views.  The over-arching aim of this thesis is to contribute to this exploration.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hess, Susan Jane","Thorpe, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2006-07-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This will be achieved by pursuing two themes. The first is a map regression that will identify the core farmland (that is the land that was ‘anciently’ enclosed), while the second establishes an interpretative framework that will allow selected Domesday metrics to be interrogated. The Domesday metrics will be used to corroborate the results of the map regression.\n\nFive case study areas have been selected to cover a series of different pays within the county, extending from the floodplains in the south-east across to the top of the Blackdown Hills and up to the fringes of Exmoor. Each case study area was created around two parishes, and their tithe maps and associated apportionments have been transcribed into a GIS to serve as the basis of the map regression.\n\nThe map regression will follow two paths. The first analyses the fieldscape, removing evidence of ‘modern’ enclosure and arriving at a map of the land that was enclosed early in the historic period, while the second concentrates upon the settlement patterns, trying to establish a counterpart to the map of the fields. The Domesday data pertaining to the agricultural exploitation of the land and to the population will be interpreted to provide two products: one that may be used to corroborate the ‘Domesday’ map of the fieldscape and the other to both inform, and assess the postulated settlement pattern of the same date The establishment of continuity is fundamental to the success of this project and a lot of effort is expended attempting to identify links between the Domesday and tithe data. Additional mechanisms that may also promote continuity have been identified and are utilised throughout. In addition to the use of the limited records, the work in each case study area is supported by palynological analyses from pollen sequences within the locale and attention has been paid to the existence of ancient woodland in each parish.\n\nWorking in a county that has a dearth of early records, the combination of map regression with corroborative evidence from Domesday works very effectively at a parochial level, but difficulties in determining the extents of the Domesday manors complicate a similar check at that more local level. Credible maps for each parish, which can probably be dated to ca. 1086, have been produced, using a methodology that may be adapted for use elsewhere.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sandover, Richard John","Rippon, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2012-01-27","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Firstly, it adds to the existing knowledge of radicalisation: it discusses the concept, and contextualises it within other forms of social phenomena such as drug-related crime. Secondly, it proposes a menu of indicators which predict or forewarn of the risk of radicalisation. Thirdly, it establishes perceptions of success at street level of modern local policing methods, namely Neighbourhood Policing and the National Intelligence Model, at identifying risk. Fourthly, it establishes a ‘toolkit’ of options which might be used by practitioners to ‘switch-off’ the radicalisation process. I argue that urban unrest, radicalisation and terrorism share common roots, with a number of key social pre-conditions existing prior to their onset: a sense of injustice, a lack of political representation, declining perceptions of legitimacy in state authorities, relative deprivation, (which may include unemployment, and a gap between expectation and achievement), discrimination and high levels of drug related crime, and I thus propose a theoretical ladder of escalation. I critically analyse policy responses arising from five seminal events, and I isolate five ‘critical success factors’ from them, suggesting that the problem in general terms is a failure to implement these success factors, thus contributing to the crisis. I revisit ‘tension indicators’ first developed following urban unrest in 1960’s America, and I link them to the critical success factors and the common roots theory. Using quantitative and qualitative primary data which consists largely of face-to-face interviews with community members, police officers, council workers and others involved in the interaction between the state and communities at street level in Oldham, Greater Manchester, I test these proposals and their links. I conclude that Neighbourhood Policing is largely successful; however the National Intelligence Model is flawed in its ability to deliver risk mitigation in this context.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gale, James Robert","Tupman, William"],"dc:date":"2012-02-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Willard’s works have become increasingly attractive to emerging generations of Christians protesting the perceived excesses and hegemony of mainstream evangelical culture. Willard presents a positive alternative to contemporary versions of evangelicalism seen by many as increasingly devoted to soteriological escapism, modern consumerism, individualism and sectarianism. Alternatively, Willard proposes a return to the original (proto) message of good news (evangel) articulated by Jesus in the New Testament. For increasing numbers of disaffected evangelicals with postmodern sensibilities, this protoevangelical vision offers a more robust doctrine of God, a return to the primacy of discipleship to Christ, and the experience of a holistic and integrated life in the Kingdom of God. Ethnographies of four evangelical organizations applying Willardian theology provide insight into the current evolution within American evangelical theology and praxis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Black Jr., Gary Elbert","DeLashmutt, Michael","Reed, Esther"],"dc:date":"2011-12-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

To this end it uses Charlton Heston as its focus in a re-appraisal of existing methods of accounting for the star phenomenon in cinema. It also concomitantly re-assesses existing accounts of the significance of Charlton Heston as a film star. This thesis posits a robust method for identifying the specificities of the star’s contribution to a film’s meanings and effects across the body of their work by drawing on Andrew Britton’s understanding of the ‘star enactment’. Present approaches through which to engage with the details of a star’s performance are considered in detail and the weaknesses of those that seek to impose external schemas onto such discussions are highlighted. The difficulties with approaches that attempt to account for the star as a signifying phenomenon through the concepts of acting and performance are also considered. Existing methods which may allow for a fruitful investigation into the significance of the star enactment, such as the commutation test, are re- formulated in this study and their benefits are demonstrated through their application to key Heston star enactments. These new understandings are also made possible through the application of an ‘ekphrastic’ method of rendering film moments. Previous readings of Heston’s star figure are also re- appraised, and their conclusions questioned, through closer reference to the evidence of details from films. The fruitfulness of this method for analysing and commenting on film is thus demonstrated and Heston’s relationship to genre and its effect on performance style is also considered in order to be able to confidently assert the specific features of the Heston aesthetic.","bibo:AuthorList":["Limmer, Katherine Anne","Neale, Steve"],"dc:date":"2011-04-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Between-individual differentiation within groups causes physiological buffering, giving altruists higher fitness than cheaters in variable environments.  Altruists increase from rarity.  Reciprocal feedback between a genotype frequency and an abiotic state may be equivalent to kin selection.\n\nAt contemporary degassing rate, biotic silicate weathering enhancement 10 – 20 times greater than present would have been required for a biologically-triggered snowball Earth.  However, biotic enhancement could have compensated by declining abiotic silicate weathering rate at low temperatures – sufficiently to accentuate a tectonically-driven glaciation.\n\nMarine carbonate speciation causes a slushball ocean to become a net CO2 source at large reservoir sizes, making glacial duration shorter than a hard snowball by a factor of the atmospheric CO2­ degassing fraction.  Equilibrated oceans require a carbonate weathering:burial ratio Wcarb : Bcarb \u003e 1 for deglaciation by CO2(g) increase.\n\nIf adequate biotic silicate weathering enhancement rapidly occurs after deglaciation, subsequent reglaciation will occur within 3 – 5Myrs.  The contrast with the ~50Ma separating Neoproterozoic events invokes the elapse of a coevolutionary “succession time”, before which biotically-triggered reglaciation is improbable.  Low post-glacial silicate weathering is consistent with Si-depleted cap carbonates.  Phanerozoic reduction in glacial susceptibility resulted from physiological evolution of biotic weathering and/or calcification.\n\nEmergence of terminal cellular differentiation in Ediacara/Metazoa required an environmental context E, provided by Neoproterozoic glaciations, in which the high fitness cost was adaptive.  Restriction of the biosphere to refugia experiencing extreme, repeated founder effects raised kin selection for altruism.  Between-group isolation limited cheat migration, accentuating group viability selection for altruism.  Both processes occurred globally, over multi-million year timescales; explaining subsequent proliferation of Ediacaran macrobiota.","bibo:AuthorList":["Boyle, RA"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

For this investigation, 8 shallow cores (\u003c1 m) were recovered from various locations in the estuary. These cores were subsequently logged, photographed and divided into approximately 5 cm depth intervals. The geochemistry and mineralogy of 68 samples from the cores were analysed. Bulk sediment geochemistry was determined by XRF and data for Ba, Cu, Pb and Zn are presented here. The mineralogy of the samples was determined by XRD. In addition, the samples from two cores were selected for mineralogical analysis using automated SEM-EDS (QEMSCAN®). The data show a sediment depth related geochemical trend with typically the lowest concentrations of Ba, Cu, Zn and Pb at the bases of the cores. Several of the sampling sites reveal a marked peak in the concentration of Pb and Zn mid-core; however, Cu values are low and invariant throughout. Postdating the Pb-Zn peak, there is a subsequent elevation in Ba in many of the cores studied, at a sediment depth of between 10 and 20 cm. Maximum concentrations of Ba reach 3360 ppm; Pb, 2220 ppm; Zn, 887 ppm and Cu, 258 ppm. Detrital minerals present include: barite, rutile, ilmenite, zircon, monazite, pyrite, cassiterite, sphalerite, galena and chalcopyrite. Framboidal pyrite is the only diagenetic mineral observed. The geochemical results are consistent with the historical mining records in the catchment, with barite mining postdating Pb-Zn mining. Both episodes of mining have released particulate mine waste, which has accumulated within the estuarine sediments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Simons, B.","Pirrie, D.","Rollinson, G.K.","Shail, R.K."],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

For the interpretation of Helen’s myth in solo playwriting, I wrote a script that contextualised in a contemporary world the most significant characters of Helen’s myth which are: Helen, Menelaus, Hermione, Paris, Hecuba, Priam. This first practical research project investigated how characters that were contemporary reconstructions of Menelaus, Hermione, Paris , Hecuba, Priam, Telemachus were affected by Helen as an absent figure, a figure that was not present on stage but was remembered and discussed by characters. For the interpretation of Helen’s myth in collaborative playwriting, I asked three female performers to analyse the character of Helen and then conceptualise and write their own Helen character. The performers’ analyses and rewritings of Helen inspired me to write a script whose story evolved around three Helen characters that were dead and interacted with one another in a space of death. This script formed part of my second practical research project that explored the ways of making Helen’s character present (both scripts that culminated out of my two practical research projects are included in the section of the Accompanying Material). I analyse the process of writing the scripts of the first and second practical research project through the use of Jungian archetype theory. In the first chapter of the thesis, I explore what an archetype is according to Jungian theory and then explain how this theory enables me to comment on the process of reinterpreting the myth of Helen of Troy through the writing of the two scripts. In the second chapter, which is the commentary on the first practical research project, I show how archetype theory provides a theoretical tool with which I can clarify and analyse how I reinterpreted and/or reworked the archetypal emotional energies of Menelaus, Hermione, Hecuba, Priam, Paris, Telemachus in the writing of new characters. In the third chapter, which is the commentary on the second practical research project, I investigate how the archetype theory helped me identify the key emotional experiences of the performers’ Helen characters, experiences which I organised and developed further in the writing of my own Helen characters. I conclude my thesis by arguing that my scripts cannot provide a final interpretation of Helen’s myth because they still lack a certain overarching theme or concept.","bibo:AuthorList":["Souris, Ioannis","Ley, Graham"],"dc:date":"2011-11-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is only relatively recently that the value of the coastal heritage resource has been recognised and consequently there have been few attempts to produce a quantitative assessment of this resource and to evaluate the threats with which it is faced. This thesis examines the background to coastal management and the development of coastal archaeological research in the United Kingdom. It assesses the range of perceived threats to the coastal heritage and the means of ranking or prioritising sites in terms of their significance and vulnerability.\nSix coastal areas of the Isle of Wight are selected as case studies representing geomorphological diversity and rich and varied archaeology. Using data from the county Historic Environment Record together with a range of datasets including historic mapping, aerial photographs and LiDAR surveys within ArcView GIS, the techniques used to calculate past coastal recession and heritage loss are assessed. The results are then used to predict future losses, applying formulae which are regularly used in shoreline management planning and using Defra (2006e) projections of sea-level rise.\nThe results indicate that it is relatively easy to produce a quantification of past coastal recession and heritage loss, and to use this data to predict future losses, but it is suggested that the results should be used with caution because of the errors inherent to the datasets and the unpredictable nature of coastal erosion. The current means of managing the heritage of the coast are discussed and recommendations are made for future work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Loader, Rebecca Dawn","Van de Noort, Robert"],"dc:date":"2011-09-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

They allow examination of the trade-offs between true and false positive\nrates as misclassification costs are varied. Examination of the resulting graphs and calcu-\nlation of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) allows assessment of how well a classifier is\nable to separate two classes and allows selection of an operating point with full knowledge\nof the available trade-offs.\nIn this thesis a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is used to find clas-\nsifiers whose ROC graph locations are Pareto optimal. The Relevance Vector Machine\n(RVM) is a state-of-the-art classifier that produces sparse Bayesian models, but is unfor-\ntunately prone to overfitting. Using the MOEA, hyper-parameters for RVM classifiers are\nset, optimising them not only in terms of true and false positive rates but also a novel\nmeasure of RVM complexity, thus encouraging sparseness, and producing approximations\nto the Pareto front. Several methods for regularising the RVM during the MOEA train-\ning process are examined and their performance evaluated on a number of benchmark\ndatasets demonstrating they possess the capability to avoid overfitting whilst producing\nperformance equivalent to that of the maximum likelihood trained RVM.\nA common task in bioinformatics is to identify genes associated with various genetic\nconditions by finding those genes useful for classifying a condition against a baseline. Typ-\nically, datasets contain large numbers of gene expressions measured in relatively few sub-\njects. As a result of the high dimensionality and sparsity of examples, it can be very easy\nto find classifiers with near perfect training accuracies but which have poor generalisation\ncapability. Additionally, depending on the condition and treatment involved, evaluation\nover a range of costs will often be desirable. An MOEA is used to identify genes for clas-\nsification by simultaneously maximising the area under the ROC curve whilst minimising\nmodel complexity. This method is illustrated on a number of well-studied datasets and ap-\nplied to a recent bioinformatics database resulting from the current InChianti population\nstudy.\nMany classifiers produce “hard”, non-probabilistic classifications and are trained to find\na single set of parameters, whose values are inevitably uncertain due to limited available\ntraining data. In a Bayesian framework it is possible to ameliorate the effects of this\nparameter uncertainty by averaging over classifiers weighted by their posterior probabil-\nity. Unfortunately, the required posterior probability is not readily computed for hard\nclassifiers. In this thesis an Approximate Bayesian Computation Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo algorithm is used to sample model parameters for a hard classifier using the AUC\nas a measure of performance. The ability to produce ROC curves close to the Bayes op-\ntimal ROC curve is demonstrated on a synthetic dataset. Due to the large numbers of\nsampled parametrisations, averaging over them when rapid classification is needed may\nbe impractical and thus methods for producing sparse weightings are investigated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Clark, Andrew Robert James","Everson, Richard"],"dc:date":"2011-12-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In this the-sis, an optimization-based worst-case analysis framework is developed for\nspace applications. The proposed framework has been applied and success-fully validated on a number of European Space Agency funded research\nprojects in the areas of flexible satellites, hypersonic re-entry vehicles, and\nautonomous rendezvous systems.\nFirstly, the problem of analyzing the robustness of an Attitude and Orbital\nControl Systems (AOCS) for a flexible scientific satellite with a large num-ber of uncertainties is considered. The analysis employs a detailed simula-tion model of a flexible satellite and multivariable controller, together with\na number of frequency and time domain performance criteria which are\ncommonly used by the space industry to verify correct functionality of full-authority multivariable satellite control systems. Second, the flying qualities\nanalysis of a re-entry vehicle is investigated for a number of complex sce-narios involving different types of uncertainties and disturbances. Specific\nmethods are utilized to deal with analysis problems involving probabilistic\nuncertainties, physically correlated uncertainties and highly dynamical dis-turbances. In another study, an integrated analytical/optimization-based\nanalysis framework is proposed for the robustness analysis of AOCS for\na telecoms satellite with flexible appendages. We develop detailed Linear\nFractional Transformation (LFT)-based models of the uncertainties present\nin a modern telecom satellite and apply µ-analysis to these models in or-der to generate robustness guarantees. We validate these models and re-sults by cross-checking them against worst-case analysis results produced\nby global optimization algorithms applied to the original system model. Fi-nally, the optimization-based framework developed in this thesis is employed\nto analyze the robustness of the Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC)\nsystem for autonomous spacecraft. This study considers the autonomous\nrendezvous problem over the terminal flight phase in the presence of a large\nnumber of realistic parametric uncertainties and a number of safety criteria\nrelated to the capture specification. An integrated analytical/optimization-based approach was also developed for this problem so that the computa-tional cost of simulation-based analyses can be reduced, through leveraging\nresults from robust control tools such asµ-analysis.\nThe main contributions of the thesis are (a) to provide convincing demon-strations of the usefulness of optimization-based worst-case analysis on a\nnumber of different space applications, each of which involves highly com-plex simulators developed by leading industrial companies from the Euro-pean Space sector, and (b) to show how optimization-based analysis meth-ods may be combined with analytical tools from robust control theory to\ncreate a more integrated, efficient and reliable verification and validation\nprocess for space applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wang, Wenfei","Bates, Declan"],"dc:date":"2011-12-20","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This combined electromagnetic-micromagnetic simulation technique is particularly important for modeling electromagnetic interaction with lossy magnetic material in the presence of current and magnetic sources, particularly at very high frequencies. The efficient implementation involves simple two-point spatial interpolations that are applicable to two and three-dimensional FDTD grids, and uses a stable iterative algorithm for the time integration of the LLG equation. A ferromagnetic resonance numerical experiment on a rectangular Permalloy prism excited through its cross-section by a non-uniform pulse field from a transmission line was carried out for the purpose of verifying the combined FDTD-LLG computations. The numerical results were in good agreement with linearised analytical solutions of the LLG equation for uniform and non-uniform precession modes. This paper also presents a brief investigation on the use of non-staggered FDTD grid schemes to model magnetic material using the LLG equation, and indicates that the classical FDTD staggered scheme offers simplicity in implementation and more accuracy for modeling wave interaction with lossy magnetic material than the non-staggered schemes based on Maxwell’s equations formulation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Aziz, Mustafa M.","Kong, JA"],"dc:date":"2009","doi":"10.2528/PIERB09042304","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Although fantasy films can be found in every decade of the last century, the genre only became persistently successful from the late 1970s onwards. Perhaps the relatively recent prominence of fantasy goes some way to explain why the genre lacks the academic discourse that other film genres have encouraged. Another reason why fantasy has evaded considerable discussion as a genre could be because of the difficulty in defining it. Fantasy can encompass numerous types of films, and features an array of different thematic and visual styles. Previous studies examining fantasy either fail to consider the mode as a genre, or only consider a limited array of films. \n\nUsing Tzvetan Todorov’s assessment of The Fantastic as a framework, this thesis examines fantasy films from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. I reassert fantasy’s position as a genre rather than a mode or impulse. Analysing a wide range of films from this period, this thesis outlines the preoccupations of the genre and identifies the various cycles and sub-genres encompassed by the term ‘fantasy’. These categories include those that concern the style of film and those that concern the intended audience. Deconstructing the fantasy genre in these sub-genres makes it more manageable to appraise the genre as a whole. Consistent patterns emerge in the examination of these films, ranging from archetypal characters to a fixation with subversion. The 1980s was a critical time for fantasy cinema as it was the first sustained period of frequent successful films. Fantasy was the most commercially successful genre of the decade; Hollywood’s output in this period still reverberates in today’s industry. Thus, the fantasy genre is most worthy of the critical discussion afforded to other genres.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ghai, Tara","Neale, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2011-09-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Notable contemporary actor training institutions in these countries train the actor-students for representational performances in representational settings. In this study, methodologies are examined for training actors who will perform on open stages or in presentational settings. The subject matter of this study fits into the broader field of performance studies, with an emphasis on training and the body in performance, with a particular focus on performing on open stages such as the New Globe. This thesis is not intended to negate the benefits derived from the representational actor training available, but to create a methodology which can be infused or taught concurrently with readily available actor training curricula. The argument is made that often in contemporary actor training the examples taught and paradigms used are Shakespearean, although Shakespeare did not write his plays with the intention of representational performances. Whilst the primary focus of this study centres on presentational actor training for the New Globe stage, the findings are applicable to other open stages or presentational settings that present the same or similar challenges.\n\nThis qualitative research through practice utilizes two of the current models for actor training taught at the New Globe. These methodologies were documented, practiced, taught and examined. This thesis was aided by the historical research conducted on Shakespeare performances, their presentational performance settings, and contemporary presentational performance spaces available. Possible training methodologies that can address the unique demands of open stage work have also been surveyed. The two new models, lazzi of the commedia dell’arte and capoeira, are introduced as applications to enhance the study’s findings.\n\nAt the end, it is clearly understood that there is a need for others to build on this work, to accept some tenets, to challenge others, and to suggest innovations not previously considered. The training process is an ongoing dynamic that will benefit from scrutiny and improvement.\n\nAs a result of this written presentation, there should be clarity between those actor training programmes that prepare actor-students for the open stage and those that prepare them for the proscenium stage and settings. Without denigrating the value of the more common and highly regarded actor training programmes for the proscenium stage, a claim is made for the need to give greater attention to performances on the open stage and to the preparation necessary to adequately equip the actors who expect to perform there.","bibo:AuthorList":["Zizek, Ivan","Daboo, Jerri"],"dc:date":"2011-03-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It does so by embedding the analysis in a survey of the evolution of broader Saudi socio-political dynamics; drawing in particular on Gramsci, it asks whether the system is moving from a form of patrimonial state to one of ideological hegemony, and whether the KACND is a catalyst in this transition or may even be part of the apparatus that is driving this transition, including its indirect or unintended effects. \n\nTo that end, the thesis examines the mutual relationship between KACND and the key Saudi social constituencies, with their attendant issues. In particular, it explores the extent to which the KACND’s activities directly and indirectly impact on internal cross-constituency communication and discourse in the Kingdom.\n\nThe thesis explores the legitimisation of state-society dialogue in Saudi Arabia, focusing on the direct and indirect consequences of the National Dialogue process with reference to the role and activities of KACND. It examines the expanding activities of KACND, including the evolving range of issues discussed as part of the institution’s activities, and the scope of participants.  It highlights the shift from ideology-based National Dialogue Meetings such as on national unity and women’s rights, to service-based National Dialogues such as on employment and health. It also examines the newly established Cultural Discourse and assesses the impact of this initiative as a space for ideological debate. \n\nThe study is based on extensive fieldwork in Saudi Arabia from 2009 to 2011, referencing information and official documentation not previously available, and drawing on findings from a wide range of focus groups, interviews, and participant observation with National Dialogue participants, KACND officials, government ministers, lawyers, journalists, scholars and members of minority constituencies","bibo:AuthorList":["Thompson, Mark Colin","Nonneman, Gerd"],"dc:date":"2012-01-26","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

NF1 has been described as a condition without parameters; physical features, cognitive symptomatology, and complications such as malignancy, are highly variable, both within and between families, and over the lifetime of affected individuals. This thesis explores the significance of the recent classifications of NF1 as a ‘genetic syndrome’, in terms of the subjecthood of affected individuals, their family experiences and the way it is managed within the healthcare system. The research is based on qualitative semi-structured interviews of NF1 individuals, their families (n\u003d30) and healthcare professionals who work with NF1 (n\u003d11) and employs Grounded Theory and Narrative Analysis inspired methods of analysis. As such, it provides an empirical investigation of many of the sociological theories which have been developed in response to genetic disease, particularly genetic responsibility, biocitizenship and the medicalization of the family. \nNF1 was still experienced by patients and treated by the healthcare system, as a condition without parameters i.e., as a disparate set of symptoms with uncertain meaning, rather than as a ‘whole’. The majority of the respondents - regardless of the severity of NF1 - rejected NF1 genetic identities, employing diverse downplaying strategies to normalise it. NF1 was salient at certain critical junctures in individuals’ lifecourses, especially in relation to reproductive choices, disclosure and management of pressing symptoms. Family experiences with genetic conditions, the relations of family or kinship, health behaviours, familial surveillance and disclosure did not necessarily follow the lines of biomedical knowledge and genetic inheritance. The analysis also revealed a degree of mirroring between the structure of the healthcare provision for NF1 and patients’ constructions of the condition, for example the lack of illness identity. The example of NF1 shows that the identification of the genetic basis of a condition does not necessarily provide patients and healthcare professionals with more parameters to manage it.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carrieri, Daniele","Farrimond, Hannah","Kelly, Susan"],"dc:date":"2011-10-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This thesis focuses on studying performances of the Hakka Contemporary Theatre created by female directors (Hakka and Non-Hakka) in Taiwan to observe how they combine western modern theatre forms with Hakka traditional and cultural elements and further transformed the specifics of Hakka culture on stage and represented various images of Hakka women. Through applying theories in relation to diaspora discourse, the hybridity of post-colonialism and postcolonial feminism and theatre study as the foundation of academic research, I attempted to critically examine the hybrid forms and development of the Hakka Contemporary Theatre to explore in depth the meaning of Hakka culture represented in theatre. \nIn this thesis, I firstly offer performance analysis and draw on hybridity discourse and feminism in relation to post-colonial study to discuss three elements: the interaction and negotiated relationship between Hakka women (including female directors and the Hakka actresses), Hakka culture, and modern theatre forms. Furthermore, as part of my research, I critically reflect upon a practical performance project I have undertaken to illustrate how Hakka culture could be presented as subject and be constructed as the subjectivity of the Hakka ethnic group in post-colonial Taiwan.

Stainless Steel/CoCr hybrid samples were also manufactured and tested to investigate the advantages of functionally graded materials (FGMs).\n\tAl alloy research began with examining the requirements for successful Al alloy consolidation in SLM and through experimentation it was found that Al alloys with good welding properties were the best choice: pure Al was found to be completely unsuitable. 6061 Al alloy was then used as a base material to manufacture Al-Cu alloy samples. Single layer SLM samples were produced first, which resulted in recognised Al-Cu microstructures forming. Multilayer Al alloy SLM research resulted in the discovery of the theorised ability to manufacture Al-Cu alloy parts with a nanocrystalline Al matrix with dispersed Al2Cu quasicrystals, resulting in a material comparable to a metal matrix composite that showed excellent corrosion resistance and compressive strength. \n\tFinally, a demonstration part was made to test the capability of the SLM process producing an aerospace type geometry using a customised Al alloy. Observations during manufacture and post process analysis showed that Al alloys were susceptible to changes in mechanical properties due to the geometry of the manufactured part.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jerrard, Peter George Eveleigh","Hao, Liang"],"dc:date":"2011-08-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

To answer this question, first we develop a theoretical framework to explain the growth process in the context of financial development assuming that human capital is heterogeneous in terms of the skills and education people have. Then, by using the data sets based on five-year averages over 1960-2010 and 1980-2010, covering 107 developed and developing countries, we empirically investigate the extensions of the theoretical framework developed earlier. These extensions cover the relationships between:\n1. Income inequality and economic growth\n2. Financial development, human capital and income inequality, and\n3. Financial development, human capital and poverty\nWe provide empirical evidence using modern panel data techniques of dynamic and static GMM. The findings elucidate that income inequality and economic growth are inter-dependent on each other. There exists an inverse relationship between initial inequality and economic growth. The changes in income inequality follow the pattern identified by Kuznets (1955) known as Kuznets’ hypothesis. The results also show that financial development helps in reducing income inequalities and in alleviating poverty, only when there is a sufficient level of human capital available. On the basis of our findings we develop the term \"effective financial development\" which means that financial development is effective in accelerating growth levels, reducing income inequalities and alleviating poverty only if there is a sufficient level of human capital available.\nThe empirical study covers multiple aspects of financial development like private credit extended by banks and other financial institutions, liquid liabilities and stock market capitalization. The results of the empirical investigations are robust to multiple data sets and various indicators of income inequality, financial development, poverty and human capital. The study also provides marginal analysis, which helps in understanding the impact of financial development on inequality and poverty at different levels of human capital.\nThis research study of effective financial development can be a useful learning paradigm for the academics and researchers interested in growth economics and keen to learn how poverty and income inequality can be reduced effectively. This study can also be useful for the policy makers in the financial institutions, because it provides robust empirical evidence that shows that financial development cannot help in alleviating poverty and in reducing inequalities unless there is a sufficient level of human capital available. The findings can be useful for policy makers, particularly in the developing countries where high levels of income inequalities and poverty are big problems. This study explains the mechanism of how effective financial development can be used to reduce income inequalities and to alleviate poverty. It also explains the process of inter-linkages between financial development, human capital, inequality, economic growth and financial instability. The policy makers can also take advantage from the marginal analyses that illustrate the minimum levels of private credit and primary and secondary schooling above which the effects of financial development and human capital become significant in reducing inequalities and poverty.","bibo:AuthorList":["Asad, Humaira","Maloney, John","Davidson, James"],"dc:date":"2012-02-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The investigation consists of analysis of two trends of thought which reformulate the ideas and projects of an earlier generation of dissidence. These trends, which have adopted a clearly more ‘accommodationist’ discourse towards difference of opinion, peaceful coexistence, political competition, equality, pluralism, and gender inclusiveness, have adapted themselves to a new context of social revolution.\nThis social revolution has resulted from the expansion of links with the outside world, and this has been deepened through the process of ‘reintellectualisation’. This term used by scholars of Muslim politics such as Dale Eickelman is used in the dissertation to contextualise the rise of discourses of moderation. In particular, this reintellectualisation relates to two processes, which are gradually changing the culture in the direction of more public debate, participation and acceptance of values of dialogue and diversity in general. The first is the media revolution which increased the flow of information and the other is the massification of university education abroad. These two combined factors contribute to a quasi-cultural shift in Saudi society. This dynamic is not acknowledged by Orientalist scholarship that treats the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as incompatible with change.\nThe key objective of the dissertation is to analyse the discourses of moderation of two prominent trends of thought, which are called here ‘pragmatists’ (not liberals) and ‘puritanical’ (not conservative). It is through this investigation that the key values they both associate with moderation become clear. The investigation uses discourse analysis of primary data both spoken and written. These two combined sources disclose a number of preliminary observations. The pragmatist trend is not fully secular and is still influenced by the politico-religious identity of the Kingdom. Its discourse of moderation relies on Western values and concepts but these values and concepts are not in any way anti-Islamic. The puritanical trend puts the politico-religious tradition into sharper focus, showing attachment to the agenda of da’wa and the normative framework of Islam’s socio-moral order. However, this trend shows signs of moderation that is no longer concerned with issues of jihad, and is venturing into areas of political reform having to do with just government, equal citizenship, and forms of inclusiveness within the normative system of Islam.","bibo:AuthorList":["AL Yahya, Eid","Sadiki, Larbi"],"dc:date":"2011-12-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Many institutions employ native English speaking teachers, referred to as either NESTs or NS, for language classes and insist that content teachers operate through this second or other language (L2), to the detriment of ‘non-native’ English speaking teachers in terms of recruitment, and also to the detriment of the students who must study their major subjects via a foreign language. NS teachers are expected to enforce a monolingual classroom environment where English is compulsory and use of the students’ first language is penalised. The U.A.E. is also engaged in spreading this monolingual culture to primary and secondary schools. \n\nThis mixed methodology study evaluates faculty and management perceptions of the English medium status quo and current concerns within the TEFL/ TESOL profession. As well as surveying faculty opinions via a quantitative questionnaire and then a qualitative appraisal of written comments, interviews with senior management aided a critical appraisal of so-called ‘common-sense’ (Tollefson, 2002) policies and assumptions. The quantitative stage indicated discrepancies between different groups of faculty and the qualitative analysis of written comments and interview data allowed for some, often contradictory, themes to emerge.\n\nIt will be suggested that many faculty were unconvinced that monolingual classroom environments were efficacious. EMI was challenged on the grounds that studying through another language adds to the learner’s cognitive burden (Troudi, 2009) and makes mastery of content subjects more difficult and contingent upon the student’s language skills. The management interviewees conceded these issues but felt that Content and Language Integrated Learning in English was vital for students who must function in an increasingly globalised market place. Little thought was given to what this might mean for the status of Arabic.\n\nIt was recommended that Arabic should be reinstated as the medium of content instruction, that English be taught as a foreign language only, and that the way in which English is taught should be critically overhauled to make best use of the diverse skills of NESTs and NNESTs alike. It was also suggested that countries such as the U.A.E. are more likely to achieve the modernity they seek by following a model where the L1 is the language of instruction, while English fulfils its parallel role as a foreign language and international lingua-franca.","bibo:AuthorList":["McLaren, Peter Bowman","Troudi, Salah"],"dc:date":"2011-09-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":8746601,"ep:Repository":45,"dc:type":["Thesis or dissertation","Doctoral","PhD","PhD in Physics"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Magnetisation and Transport Studies of Carbon Based Nanostructures","bibo:abstract":"This thesis presents investigations in to the properties of bulk graphite, graphitised silicon carbide and exfoliated graphene. The background physics and theory relevant to the investigations is detailed. This is followed by descriptions of the equipment and methods used during experiments presented within this thesis. \n\nMillikelvin de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas experiments were performed for several types of graphite. These types included forms of natural, kish and highly orientated pyrolitic graphite. Oscillations for two sets of carriers (holes and electrons) were observed with varying strengths between the types. This suggests that the mobility of the charge carriers in graphite can vary significantly depending on the formation of the graphite bulk. Hall measurement results support this statement, as the electron to hole mobility ratio appears much greater in natural graphite than in highly orientated pyrolitic graphite. \n\nAnalysis of the oscillations for each sample indicates that the electrons have a higher mobility than the holes, and that the effective mass of the holes is lower than that of the electrons. Depending on the sample, the mobility of the holes was found to vary between 1.07-\u003e1.42 m^2/Vs and the mobility of the electrons between 1.64-\u003e16.0 m^2/Vs. The effective masses of the charge carriers were found to be 0.031+-0.007 m0 and 0.046+-0.003 m0 for holes and electrons respectively.\n\nThe nature of the carriers for the different types of graphite was determined. It was found in the de Haas-van Alphen experiments that the phase of the carriers varied between samples. However, in the majority of cases, the electrons were shown to be Dirac fermions. In Shubnikov-de Haas experiments, the electrons demonstrated an indeterminate nature. In both types of measurement, the holes were found to have an indeterminate nature. \n\nDe Haas-van Alphen experiments were also performed on two graphitised silicon carbide samples. The sample fabricated at The University of Leeds exhibited a complicated background magnetisation. This is not characteristic of a carbon system and so indicates a lack of a carbon film. The sample fabricated by the Georgia Institute of Technology exhibited a magnetisation akin to ZYB grade highly orientated pyrolitic graphite. \n\nSheet magnetoresistance measurements were also performed on a more recent graphitised silicon carbide sample, fabricated at The University of Leeds. Weak localisation was observed as well as a large number of non-oscillatory features. These features were attributed to the absence of a defined Hall-bar geometry and the presence of multiple graphene domains between surface contacts.\n\nMagnetotransport and activation energies of exfoliated graphene flakes were also investigated. The charge carrier mobilities at 240K for a particular sample were found to be 20,670+-30 cm^2/Vs for holes and 22,770+-40 cm^2/Vs for electrons. These mobilities rose to 25,600+-200 cm^2/Vs for holes and 25,900+-200 cm^2/Vs for electrons by 2.5K. This observation implies that the holes experience stronger phonon scattering than the electrons.\n\nThe activation energies for filling factors nu\u003d+-2 and nu\u003d+-6 were found at several magnetic fields for the sample. The activation energies allowed for determination of the broadening of the Landau levels. The broadening of the nu\u003d+-6$ levels were found to be constant as a function of magnetic field, with Gamma_{+-6}\u003d260+-40 K. The nu\u003d-2 level also showed a constant value for the broadening, Gamma_{-2}\u003d620+-40 K. However, for nu\u003d+2, the activation energy approached the bare Landau level separation at high magnetic fields. This implies a zero-energy Landau level that is narrower than the higher levels. Further to the mobility asymmetry at high temperatures, the difference in broadening between the nu\u003d-2 and nu\u003d+2 sides of the zeroth Landau level suggests that there is a form of scattering which affects the holes more than the electrons near the Dirac point.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hubbard, Stephen Brian","Usher, Alan"],"dc:date":"2012-03-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

I intend to examine the career of a single cinematographer, in order to demonstrate whether a dinstinctive cinematographic style may be defined.  The task of this thesis is therefore to define that cinematographer’s style and trace its development across the course of a career.  The subject that I shall employ in order to achieve this is the émigré cinematographer Eugen Schüfftan, who is perhaps most famous for his invention ‘The Schüfftan Process’ in the 1920s, but who subsequently had a 40 year career acting as a cinematographer.  During this time Schüfftan worked throughout Europe and America, shooting films that included Menschen am Sonntag (Robert Siodmak et al, 1929), Le Quai des brumes (Marcel Carné, 1938), Hitler’s Madman (Douglas Sirk, 1942), Les Yeux sans visage (Georges Franju, 1959) and The Hustler (Robert Rossen, 1961).  During the course of this thesis I shall examine the evolution of Schüfftan’s style, and demonstrate how Schüfftan has come to be misunderstood as a cinematographer of German Expressionism.  The truth, as I will show, is far more complex.  Schüfftan also struggled throughout his career to cope with the consequences of exile.  In this thesis I will also therefore examine the conditions of exile for an émigré cinematographer, and in particular Schüfftan’s prevention from joining the American Society of Cinematographers.  I intend to demonstrate how an understanding of cinematographic style can shed new light on a film, and to give renewed attention to an important cinematographer who has been largely ignored by film history.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Tomas Rhys","Hayward, Susan"],"dc:date":"2011-10-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Organised around an examination of Olivier’s four Shakespearean film adaptations (including the unmade Macbeth), the project focuses on the ways in which the concept of \u0027Shakespeare\u0027 – signalled throughout by its italicisation – is appropriated through Olivier’s image in relation to the industrial and cultural contexts of the wartime and post-war British film industry. It also examines articulations of Shakespearean selfhood and related reappropriations of the filmic image in Olivier’s life writing, exploring how Olivier engages with his own star persona. In examining the relationship that exists between broader industrial-cultural appropriations of \u0027Shakespeare\u0027 and a sense of a star’s personal connection with the national poet, the thesis explores (in addition to the film texts) extratextual materials such as fan letters, publicity documents, theatre and film ephemera, magazine interviews, newspaper criticism, industrial reports and personal and professional correspondence in order to interrogate the national-cultural function of a star text whose image is aligned to \u0027Shakespeare\u0027. \nThis thesis seeks to make an original contribution to Shakespeare on screen studies by constituting the fullest study of Laurence Olivier’s cinematic Shakespearean career to date. In introducing and analysing previously unseen archival material (including screenplays and shooting scripts relating to the unmade Macbeth), the thesis informs our understanding of the evolving history of British Shakespeare production and, therefore, of the history of Shakespeare on screen. Rethinking Olivier’s cultural currency as a Shakespearean star in 2012 and in the space of the archive, the thesis also contributes to the theoretical thinking underpinning Shakespearean performance studies and archival studies. Finally, the thesis opens the way for further considerations as to how (and to what effect) the Shakespearean star operates as a national and transnational phenomenon.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barnes, Jennifer Ann","Aebischer, Pascale"],"dc:date":"2012-02-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These fluctuations are conceptually related to the so-called ‘timing, and ‘hot issues’ markets. This thesis conducts a comprehensive examination of the determinants of timing of IPOs and rights issues in the UK, seeking to inspect and compare the main factors that drive these fluctuations. Specifically, I compare the extent to which the favourable business and economic conditions, bull market timing, investor sentiment, and decreasing adverse selection costs can explain these fluctuations. For IPOs, the overall findings show a strongly and robustly significant evidence in support of adverse selection costs hypothesis. Economic conditions, bull market timing and investor sentiment hypotheses are also important determinants of IPOs timing, but of less significance and robustness. For rights issues, the timing story appears different. The empirical evidence is mostly consistent with the bull market timing hypothesis. Investor sentiment proxy is supported but not robustly consistent across various tests. By contrast, the economic conditions and information asymmetry proxies generally exhibited inconsistent findings. \n\nIt has been recently posited that equity-issuing firms behaviourally time their offerings to exploit stock mis-valuations and investor over-optimism. If so, this behavioural timing is expected to be reflected in a direct relation between mis-valuation of IPOs and right issues and poor post-issue stock returns. This mis-valuation is examined (i) directly via calculating a ratio of the price to an intrinsic value of the firm (as a proxy for relative overvaluation) and (ii) indirectly via looking at the intensity of equity issuance activity since investor over-optimistism and stock over-valuations are expected to substantially differ between hot and cold issues markets. \n\nThe findings suggest that both IPOs and rights issues are significantly over-valued compared to other non-issuing firms. More importantly, the post-issue stock returns are found to be significantly and robustly different between IPOs and rights issues launched during hot issues markets compared to those launched during cold and normal issues markets, which strongly supports the behavioural timing hypothesis. However, the overall findings derived based on the post-issue stock returns conditional on relative overvaluation are less consistent with the behavioural timing hypothesis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ali, Heba Ahmed Abass","Gregory, Alan"],"dc:date":"2012-04-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Their history goes from Romanticism up to modern-day tourism. With the majority dating to the past 30 years, they do more than simply present (re)constructed outdoor sceneries based on archaeology. They have an important role as education facilities and many showcase archaeology in a variety of ways. Compared to other museum categories, archaeological open-air museums boast a wide variety of manifestations. This research assesses the value of archaeological open-air museums, their management and their visitors, and is the first to do so in such breadth and detail. After a literature study and general data collection among 199 of such museums in Europe, eight archaeological open-air museums from different countries were selected as case studies. They included museums in a very varied state with different balances between public versus private funding levels on the one hand, and on the other the proportion of private individuals to educational groups among their visitors. The issue of ‘quality’ was investigated from different perspectives. The quality as assessed by the museum management was recorded in a management survey; the quality as experienced by their visitors was also recorded using a survey. In addition on-site observations were recorded. Management and visitors have different perspectives leading to different priorities and appreciation levels. The studies conclude with recommendations, ideas and strategies which are applicable not just to the eight archaeological open-air museums under study, but to any such museum in general. The recommendations are divided into the six categories of management, staff, collections, marketing, interpretation and the visitors. They are designed to be informative statements of use to managers across the sector.","bibo:AuthorList":["Paardekooper, Roeland Pieterszoon","Hurcombe, Linda"],"dc:date":"2012-02-14","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In-depth interviews (n \u003d 25), inclusive of case studies (n \u003d 3), with women between the ages of 29 and 66 allowed insight into the subjective contours of participant’s lives, and their particular biographical trajectories culminating in WRN participation.  Several types of narrative analyses were applied to the emergent data, and results from these revealed insights into if, why, how, and when women engaged with health and ‘active ageing’ messages across the life course.  Despite a prevalence of health knowledge, participants tended to report long periods of inactivity throughout their lives – citing the often documented barriers to physical activity such as a lack of time and caregiving responsibilities.  However, a vast majority of participants also cited an utter lack of confidence with respect to physical activity, often stemming from highly influential poor early experiences.  Embodying a perceived ‘non-sporting’ identity for as long as they had, they were foreclosed to the idea of physical activity despite simultaneously feeling pressure to participate.  For many, it was particular life events - or ‘critical moments’ – that brought participation in physical activity to the forefront (i.e., birthdays, relationship issues, bereavement, and health scares).  A consideration of these within this thesis explores the complex link that exists between health consciousness and action.  In addition, alternative narratives about who could be a runner (within WRN advertising and by word of mouth) ‘hailed’ participants to reconsider their foreclosed narratives, by offering a ‘fun and non-competitive’ atmosphere for people ‘of all ages, sizes, and abilities’.  Once pushed to action and within the WRN setting, participants described learning about themselves and their bodies, and thus developed the capacity to tell new stories.  As such, through a narrative lens, this thesis introduces the stories that participants responded to (or not), and the stories that they used to tell, felt able to tell, and – in some cases – learned how to tell about health, about ageing, and about running/physical activity.  Conclusions from this work have implications for both policy and practice, advocating for the necessity of comprehensive insight into people’s perceptions and lived experiences of (active) ageing within the context of life history, current life stage, and the everyday.","bibo:AuthorList":["Griffin, Meridith Brooke","Phoenix, Cassandra"],"dc:date":"2012-03-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The interpretation of evidence of culturally modified mammoth bone tools has varied widely across both time and space.  At different times and in different places, flaked bone toolmaking has been interpreted across the geographic expanse of the North American continent, from Beringia to central Mexico, and through a vast timeframe, from 120,000 years ago, until as recently as 10,000 years ago.  \nThe study of these purported flaked bone tool assemblages has taken many forms, and has involved efforts to understand broken mammoth bone assemblages by drawing analogies to stone toolmaking strategies, by understanding the multitude of taphonomic processes that affect archaeological bone assemblages, and by attempting to differentiate the effects of natural and cultural processes.\nThis thesis reports on a series of experiments designed to lend new actualistic evidence to the debate surrounding flaked bone toolmaking.  These experiments include investigations into the effect of different environmental conditions on the degradation of bones, the flaking characteristics of both fresh and frozen bones, and the effect of rockfall as a taphonomic process on bones exposed to different real-world environments.\nThese experiments, paired with a body of previous research, provide a basis in actualistic and taphonomic research that allows for the reassessment of archaeological and paleontological broken mammoth bone assemblages.  This thesis includes the reassessment and detailed taphonomic analysis of four mammoth bone assemblages relevant to understanding cultural bone modification and the effect of non-cultural taphonomic processes.  New interpretations of zooarchaeological assemblages from Lange/Ferguson (South Dakota, USA), Owl Cave (Idaho, USA), Inglewood (Maryland, USA), and Kent’s Cavern (Devon, UK) reveal new data that revise the understanding of the nature of these assemblages, and the effect of both natural and cultural bone fracturing agencies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Karr, Landon Patrick","Alan, Outram"],"dc:date":"2012-02-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The focus of the sampled texts and their analysis is the different relations between God and the real things of this world. \nThe method that is applied in the selection of the texts of this research relies on Pierre Bourdieu’s approach to the study of cultural production. It assumes a relational and dynamic intellectual field which creates interlinked differences and similarities. This is the reason for sampling texts which are assumed to be reasonably marginal to the main cultural establishment. \nThe kalām of the early stage, exemplified by the texts of the Zaydī al-Qāsim al-Rassī and the eastern Ibādīs, is found to emphasise the radical separation between the creator and the created. The development of this relation, which is explored through an intertextual reading of Qurʾānic exegesis, bridges the fissure, between creator and created, through the process of re-interpreting the terms of creation. The act of creation itself becomes an act of transformation, and the objects of creation become eternal ‘non-existent things’ that acquire the quality of existence. In the philosophical works of Jābir Ibn Ḥayyān, the things of this world are also reduced to transformations within the one substance that encompasses the intelligible and the material world.   \nThe results of this research show that there is a great degree of diffusion of ideas in this early stage of Islamic culture, from an assumed centre to the margins, and vice versa. The general tendencies in the texts considered reflect, on the one hand, a critique of multiplicity of principles, particularly dualism, and an emphasis on God’s unity, through different interpretations of tawḥīd. On the other hand, the sought unity itself established God’s radical transcendence from the real world, thus leading to another form of dualism dividing the world and the absolute other. The process of opposition to dualism seems to have eventually produced two forms of affirming and defining unity. Both forms define the existent things in terms of substance (jawhar), however, the kalām model expresses it in atomistic terms whilst the alchemical model of Jābir expresses it in terms of a hylomorphic model. One of these redefines the meanings of the existent and the non-existent things in term of subsistence, and the other, develops the idea of a single substance with different gradation in being.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ali, Ghazoan","Rizvi, Sajjad"],"dc:date":"2012-01-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

I respond to scientific considerations mainly at the level of the philosophy of science, particularly from David Hume and related commentators such as John Mackie and Elliott Sober. Theological aspects are considered in light of Reformed Calvinism with influence coming from Augustine and Paul. Interestingly, it is also evident that there is an Augustinian influence in the philosophy of science and I will highlight some of this in this thesis, especially with regard to the work of Alvin Plantinga and Michel Polanyi. In chapter two I look at Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion and identify various objections raised, for instance by Mackie. In this chapter I then consider the claim that the design argument can only be a weak or remote analogy to human intelligence and offer two ways forward. In chapter three I look more broadly at claims by Michael Ruse that Intelligent Design cannot be good science because it doesn’t follow the rules of methodological naturalism. In response, I consider Plantinga’s claim that Christians can move to Augustinian science and do not need to hold to naturalistic methodology in science. I also consider the thinking of Paul Feyerabend relating to criticism of methodological monism in science because it restricts scientific discovery. I also discuss concerns raised by Imre Lakatos because he believes a degree of dogmatism is necessary in science in order to hold to objective truth and avoid relativism. I then offer some thoughts as to what an Intelligent Design research programme might look like. In the fourth chapter I look at theological aspects of Intelligent Design. I discuss the question of whether it is possible to search for evidence for design apart from revelation and divine grace, and discuss difficulties highlighted by a number of theologians. I then consider the divine action debate in relation to Intelligent Design, and in the final part of the theology chapter examine question of theodicy that arise for Intelligent Design, again in light of Calvinism with its Augustinian-Pauline influence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sibley, Andrew Mark","Southgate, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2012-02-24","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These areas have been addressed for a number of years within the developed market context, whereas the same research for companies in developing countries is largely non-existent in Western literature.\n\nThe first topic is the ETR and MTR analysis. The ETR analysis offers an overview of the actual tax burden for listed companies in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), together with the Statutory Tax Rate (STR) analysis, which incorporates the tax structure aspect of tax preferences from 1994 to 2006. In 2002, the State Council stopped unauthorised corporate tax rebate from local government and 2002 became a breaking point of the corporate tax analysis. The ETR and STR analyses reveal that companies benefitted widely from tax preferences before 2002 regardless of their industry or region. However, after 2002, the ETRs increased significantly overall and the industrial and regional ETR differences are much more significant. The tax preferential industries and regions’ companies are still in the lower ETR and STR range, but the non-tax preferential companies’ ETRs and STR increased significantly after 2002. This evidences the effectiveness of Chinese tax preference policies. The MTR estimations are the first Chinese company specific MTR estimations. The MTRs were estimated from 1995 to 2002 and the MTRs results are generally consistent with ETR results, except that the MTR estimations jointly depend on the company Net Operating Loss (NOL) occurrences, income and STR. \n\nThe second topic is the determinants of ETR. An alternative view of ETR determinants is proposed. It incorporates the accounting-tax conformity theory and identifies a tax rate preference as the new ETR determinant variable to fit the Chinese taxation context. Five explanatory variables are hypothesized in associating company characteristics after controlling the company location, industry and sample period dummy variables. These explanatory variables are tax rate preference, non-operating expenses, investment gain, provision for impairment and government ownership. The ETR determinants model is also examined by OLS regression (cross-sectional), and fixed-effects and random effects regression (panel data analysis). The results show that all of the explanatory variables are statistically significant coefficients with expected signs. The results also demonstrate that the proposed ETR determinant model is superior to previous determinant models.\n\nThe third topic is implicit tax research. The results are evidence of the existence of implicit tax at the corporate level. The relationships between the company Pre-tax Return of Equity (PTROE) and tax preference variables and other control variables are also examined. The results demonstrate that there is a negative relationship between PTROE and tax rate preference when considering the companies aggregately in a large scale; and there is a positive relationship between PTROE and income related tax preference when considering the companies individually. The contradictory results indicate that in reality, the imperfect market conditions impede the realisation of implicit tax at the individual company level.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cao, Jifeng","James, Simon"],"dc:date":"2012-03-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In particular, we study how laser dynamics are influenced by laser-coupling strength, $\\kappa$, the natural frequencies of the uncoupled lasers, $\\tilde{\\Omega}_j$, and the coupling between the magnitude and phase of each lasers electric field, $\\alpha$. Equivariant bifurcation analysis, combined with Lyapunov exponent calculations, is used to study different aspects of the laser dynamics. Firstly, codimension-one and -two bifurcations of relative equilibria determine the laser coupling conditions required to achieve stable phase locking. Furthermore, we find that global bifurcations and their associated infinite cascades of local bifurcations are responsible for interesting locking-unlocking transitions. Secondly, for large $\\alpha$, vast regions of the parameter space are found to support chaotic dynamics. We explain this phenomenon through simulations of $\\alpha$-induced stretching-and-folding of the phase space that is responsible for the creation of horseshoes. A comparison between the results of a simple {\\it coupled-laser model} and a more accurate {\\it composite-cavity mode model} reveals a good agreement, which further supports the use of the simpler model to study coupling-induced instabilities in laser arrays. Finally, synchronisation properties of the laser array are studied. Laser coupling conditions are derived that guarantee the existence of synchronised solutions where all the lasers emit light with the same frequency and intensity. Analytical stability conditions are obtained for two special cases of such laser synchronisation: (i) where all the lasers oscillate in-phase with each other and (ii) where each laser oscillates in anti-phase with its direct neighbours. Transitions from complete synchronisation (where all the lasers synchronise) to optical turbulence (where no lasers synchronise and each laser is chaotic in time) are studied and explained through symmetry breaking bifurcations. Lastly, the effect of increasing the number of lasers in the array is discussed in relation to persistent optical turbulence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Blackbeard, Nicholas","Wieczorek, Sebastian","Erzgraber, Hartmut"],"dc:date":"2012-01-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In light of this, this thesis tests the performance and market valuation of CSR indicators by using a comprehensive set of KLD indicators. \n\nChapter Three of this thesis examines the effect of CSR on financial performance by incorporating CSR into the investment process. As no clear break point is found for the normalised KLD score, the net KLD score is used as an alternative portfolio metric. In addition, most KLD indicators are found to have insignificant alphas for the high-scoring, low-scoring, and long-short portfolios—meaning that investors do not earn abnormal returns through a long-short strategy. Moreover, insignificant alphas are recorded for most of the indicators under the best-in-class approach—meaning that the application of industry classification does not affect results. Finally, both the conditional Ferson and Schadt (1996) model and conditional three-factor model are used as robustness checks, with most indicators having insignificant alphas for these conditional models. As such, the results imply that there is neither outperformance nor underperformance when using portfolios formed with CSR scores; however, there are significant differences in factor loadings between high-scoring and low-scoring CSR portfolios. \n\nChapter Four uses a framework consistent with the Peasnell (1982) and Ohlson (1995) model to examine whether CSR is reflected in share prices. The CSR indicator is treated as the “other information” variable, and the association between CSR and market price is estimated by controlling for book value of equity, net income and dividends. Although the market is found to value different KLD indicators differently, most of the indicators are found to have positive impact on market value (except for corporate governance and human rights). R\u0026D and advertising expenditure are both added to the valuation model for robustness checking purposes. Some of the CSR indicators—and especially for the case of environment—are not valued during the earlier stages, but become increasingly valued over time. The ten industries are also found to have varying effects on market valuation. In summary, high-scoring CSR firms display higher valuations than low-scoring CSR firms, and thus it can be concluded that a socially responsible agenda does not conflict with maximising shareholder value.\n\nSince most of the CSR indicators in Chapter Four lead to positive market price valuations, Chapter Five aims to disaggregate the value effect into the separate components of ROE ratio, the implied cost of capital (ICC) and growth rate. Three different methodologies are used to test the relationship between CSR, ICC and the long-run growth rate. The relationship between CSR and growth rate is positive with all of the methodologies. However, the different methodologies return differing results for the relationship between CSR and ICC, which may be due to the different assumptions made by each approach. Furthermore, it suggests that long-run growth rate differences in general may be more important than ICC differences. Finally, most KLD indicators are found to have significantly higher P/V and ROE1 ratios for the high-scoring CSR portfolios than for the low-scoring CSR portfolios.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yan, Xiaojuan","Gregory, Alan","Whittaker, Julie"],"dc:date":"2012-02-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Criminal responsibility theory broadly adheres to ‘rational choice’ models of the moral self which subsume individuals’ emotionally embodied dimensions under the general direction of their rational will and abstracts their behaviour from corporeal reality.  Linking individuals with their behaviour based only on such understandings of ‘rational choice’ and abstract descriptions of behaviour overlooks the phenomenological dimensions of that behaviour and thus its moral significance as a lived experience.  To overcome this ethical shortcoming, engagement with the aesthetic as an alternative discourse can help articulate the ‘excessive’ nature of lived reality and its relationship with ‘orthodox’ knowledge; fittingly, the comics form involves interaction of rational, non-rational, linguistic, and non-linguistic dimensions, modelling the limits of conceptual thought in relation to complex reality.  Rational choice is predicated upon a split between a contextually embedded self and an abstractly autonomous self.  Analysis of the graphic novel Watchmen contends that prioritisation of rational autonomy over sensual experience is symptomatic of a ‘rational surface’ that turns away from the indeterminate ‘chaos’ of complex reality (the unstructured universe), instead maintaining the power of rational and linguistic concepts to order the world.  This ‘rational surface’ is maintained by masking that which threatens its stability: the chaos of the infinite difference of living individuals.  These epistemological foundations are reconfigured, via Watchmen, enabling engagement beyond the ‘rational surface’ by accepting the generative potential of this living chaos and calling for models of criminal identity that are ‘restless’, acknowledging the unique, shifting nature of individuals, and not tending towards ‘complete’ or stable concepts of the self-as-responsible.  As part of the aesthetic methodology of this reconfiguration, a radical extension of legal theory’s analytical canon is developed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Giddens, Thomas Philip","Skinner, Stephen","Coyle, Sean","Richardson, Janice"],"dc:date":"2011-09-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The focus of the research is the relationship between the tenants and the professional staff, in corporate environments where delivery of a user-focused service is purported to be the shared goal.  The aim has been to explore with tenants and staff their experiences of trying to make tenant involvement work at a strategic level within the organisation.\nMy research seeks (a) to unravel the methods used by the different actors to influence activities and outcomes, and (b) to examine their effects on the power balance in and between the groups of people in question. Clegg’s 1989 ‘Circuits of power’ theory is used to plot and analyse the processes involved in the transformation (or not) of power within the culture and practice of tenant involvement and the empowerment (or not) of the tenants who work with staff at the heart of these corporate cultures.  In addition I use Somerville’s 1998 typology of empowerment to illustrate the potential for organisational change.\nI gather a wide range of material, using a detailed questionnaire, 17 case studies plus a further three of national level involvement initiatives, and an analysis of 112 Housing Corporation and Audit Commission inspection reports (from 2003 and 2008).  To this I add my own experience as a participant observer in a range of settings over the period.  This thesis is intended to shed some light on why the same barriers continue to exist and why so many involved tenants and their housing associations are still struggling to make involvement really make a difference at this level, despite a decade of intensive regulations and inspection of involvement activities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hay, Deborah (Debbie) Ann","Davie, Grace"],"dc:date":"2011-10-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Principally, it tells the story of one partnership, between two primary schools in rural Devon and urban Tanzania, nested within a network of partnerships and governed by DfID’s Global School Partnership (GSP) programme.  The cross-continental nature of the school partnerships called for a multi-sited, ethnographic approach, informed and shaped by postcolonial and feminist principles.  Partnerships comprise a range of practices, most significant of which were the reciprocal teacher visits that punctuated, and energised, the partnership calendar, presenting spaces for encounter.  The emotional and embodied encounters formed the backbone of the partnerships, and produced narratives that were circulated amongst the partnerships and re-presented to audiences in the home country.  Firstly, school partnerships engendered the production of moral subjectivities, which were underscored by broad discourses of citizenship, global citizenship, and moral education.  With its objective to foster global citizenship, the global partnership occupied an ambiguous position within this discursive framework.  Secondly, the encounters presented moments in which narratives of education, teaching, and learning were produced, contested, negotiated, and in some cases, reworked by the participating teachers.  As a cultural device, the GSP was both indicative, and constitutive, of the discourse surrounding the neoliberal realignment of the education sector around the world, and provided a productive lens through which to reflect upon the contemporary transformation of the institution.  Importantly, the GSP presented a significant site in which neoliberal stories of aspiration, hard work, and global outlooks, became intimately entangled with ‘caring’ stories of concern and responsible citizenship. Most scholarship has focused on the role of secondary and tertiary education sectors in the production of the knowledge economy, but this ethnography finds that nascent discourses and imaginaries of the ‘global’ citizen are already being established and performed in primary schools around the world.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wyness, Lynne Diane","Cook, Ian"],"dc:date":"2012-05-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These transitions make up a significant portion of the diurnal cycle and are known to affect the spread of pollution due to the properties of turbulence in the residual and stable layers, resulting in phenomena such as lofting, trapping, and fumigation.\\\\\n\nTwo main simulation techniques are presented for the purpose of modelling the dispersion of passive tracers in both convective and evening transitional boundary layers: Lagrangian stochastic (LS) modelling for 1D, inhomogeneous, non-stationary turbulence; and large-eddy simulation (LES) with a particle model tracing pollutant paths using a combination of the resolved flow velocities and a random displacement model to represent sub-grid scale motions.\\\\\n\nIn the convective boundary layer, LS models more accurately representing the state of turbulence, and including the effect of skewness, are shown to produce dispersion results in closer agreement with LES. By considering individual particle trajectories, a reflective top boundary in LS models is shown to produce un-physical, sharp changes in velocity and position. By applying a correction to the vertical velocity variance based on representing the stable potential temperature gradient above the boundary layer, particles are contained within the boundary layer in a physically accurate way. \\\\\n\nAn LS model for predicting dispersion in time-varying, skewed turbulence is developed and tested for various particle releases in transitional boundary layers with different rates of decay, showing an improvement in accuracy compared with previous LS models. Further improvement is made by applying a correction to the vertical velocity variance to represent the effect of a positive potential temperature gradient developing over the course of the transition. Finally, a developing stable boundary layer is shown to have a significant trapping effect on particles released near the surface. \\\\","bibo:AuthorList":["Taylor, Alexander Charles","Beare, Robert","Thomson, David","Thuburn, John"],"dc:date":"2012-02-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The managerial factors that influence the acquisition integration are investigated and their relationships with the post-acquisition performances of the target SOEs are explored. There are three research questions: How do acquisitions influence the identity, culture and commitment of the target SOE employees? What are the factors that determine an employee’s post-acquisition identification? What are the relationships between acquisition management and post-acquisition performance? Case studies are adopted as the main research methodology in order to provide an in-depth answer to these research questions. Statistical analysis is used in order to provide clear evidence of the factors influencing post-acquisition identification and the effect of acquisitions on the performance of SOEs.\n\nThe findings of this research indicate that acquisitions have significant negative effects on the performance of target SOEs and these negative effects are mainly due to inappropriate managerial strategies adopted by Western acquirers. Further, although not significant, a positive correlation between acquisition management and acquisition performance has been found in this research, a finding which is in line with the prediction of theories and consequently, supports the assumption that acquisition management contributes to acquisition performance. All factors (pre-acquisition identification, cultural incompatibility, communication, a sense of continuity, fast reform and negative emotion) are significantly related to post-acquisition identification when age, education, salary, size, employee position and organisational tenure are controlled. Different from previous studies, which found that the individual-organisation relationship influences employees’ organisational identification in the Western context, this research finds that social relationship is a vital factor in influencing Chinese employees’ identification. Also, social relationship is a unique factor fostering Chinese employees’ positive identity, but not the shared social identity as has been found in the Western context. These findings imply that social relationship is a distinct factor in fostering employees’ organisational identification in China and consequently, in predominantly collectivistic countries. \n\nFurther, this research shows that the point held in previous studies that out-group is not necessarily discriminated against in collectivistic cultures when group membership is salient due to the collectively-oriented feature is not applicable in acquisitions because people of collectivistic cultures show a strong in-group identity, a strong motive to distinguish insiders (i.e. in-group members) from outsiders (i.e. out-group members), and a strong resistance to uncertainty. These responses are driven by the characteristics of collectivistic culture such as collective-orientation and high uncertainty avoidance.  \n\nThree particular issues emerged that may be useful for acquisition management in China. The first is the recruitment of employees at the post-acquisition stage. Selecting people as managers of post-acquisition organisations cannot be based only on their ethnic groups or multi-language capability, but also on other factors. To run post-acquisition companies, it is better to employ people who are professionals in the industry with multi-cultural working experience than those returned overseas Chinese who have been away from China for a long time and ethnic Chinese who lack managerial experience in China. The second issue is that middle-aged and older employees find it difficult to accept changes due to their deeply rooted culture. Younger employees can more easily accept the changes than middle-aged and older employees because their values are more or less in accordance with those of Westerners. The third issue is that due to the fact that the M\u0026As do not require employees to completely abandon or change their old identity, and social relationship is a unique factor in fostering organisational identification in China, these factors contribute to a sense of continuity perceived by Chinese employees and consequently lead to a positive correlation between pre- and post-acquisition identification in the acquired SOEs, which are positioned as having dominated status in acquisitions. The implications are discussed at the end of this thesis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chen, Xi","Steve, Brown","Zhenxu, Tong"],"dc:date":"2011-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Wilson suggested that spirituality can be understood as “just one more Darwinian enabling device”. In opposing this reductionism, the current enquiry develops a model of a relationship between spirituality and evolutionary theory which offers an understanding of spirituality based on evolutionary theory without reducing the former to the latter.\nFor the purposes of this enquiry, “spirituality” is taken to entail an awareness of and response both to a transcendent dimension to human existence, and to the ethical dimension. Its universality is suggested by the ubiquity of religion in human history and prehistory, although in contemporary Western society spirit¬uality is no longer the prerogative of the specific canonical religions. From a theological perspective, an understanding of the universality of spirituality despite the diversity of religious traditions is provided by the approach of religious pluralism. The model also draws on Alvin Plantinga’s model of our being endowed with a sensus divinitatis, but modifies it in two ways: i) rather than our having an inbuilt sense of the divine as God, the current enquiry proposes that we have an inbuilt sense of the transcendent (termed the sensus transcendentis); ii) this sensus transcendentis is a product of evolutionary processes.\nThe discipline of evolutionary psychology holds that the human mind is best understood as a suite of “mental modules”, psychological adaptations which evolved in response to the challenges posed by the total environment (physical, social and biotic) during the long reaches of human evolution. In the proposed model, the sensus transcendentis is one such module, opening us to meaning, purpose and value which transcend the material environment whilst being embedded within it. Evidence is provided to support the contentions both that we possess a sensus transcendentis, and that it has evolutionary origins. Possible implications for theology and for religious faith arising from the proposed model are discussed.\n\nKey words: adaptation, altruism, evolution, evolutionary psychology, Hick, mental module, Plantinga, religious pluralism, sensus divinitatis, sensus transcendentis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Skinner, Richard Norman Frank","Wynn, Mark"],"dc:date":"2012-03-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Through their consistent representation and exhibition, freaks became a part of mainstream culture. Due to their regular reproduction, freak narratives and images often perpetuated the lives of freaks long after their deaths; thereby creating freak legacies. This thesis employs the theoretical concept of generativity, drawn from John Kotre’s work, to investigate the role of freaks and freak legacies in late nineteenth-century culture. Generativity is the process which allows the continuation of lives after death, through the creation and perpetuation of legacy. Through their regular representation and reproduction in print, I argue, freaks were generative in that they contributed to the perpetuation of their own and others’ legacies in late nineteenth-century Britain. In particular, the generativity of freak narratives for medical and popular press readerships is considered to demonstrate the multiple ways freak representations were constructed to suit broad and diverse audiences.\n\tThe first two chapters of this thesis examine popular representations of freaks and the last two look at medicine’s interaction with freak bodies. The first half of this thesis establishes the mainstream status of freaks by exploring their numerous representations in a diverse range of popular print sources. The first chapter demonstrates some of the ways popular media engaged with freaks and their legacies. In the second chapter, the popular appeal of freaks is further explored through a case study of the two UK visits of the Barnum and Bailey circus at the end of the nineteenth century. Particular attention is paid to the generative use of freaks in building the famous showman Phineas T. Barnum’s legacy. Then, the next half of this thesis turns to medical culture to explore the professional engagement with anomalous bodies. Chapter three explores the intricacies of the medicine –freak relationship by demonstrating medicine’s attempts to assert authority over freakish bodies. The final chapter examines the importance of legacy to the medical profession and offers an analysis of three freak case studies which demonstrate this aim. These case studies also make up a chapter in Popular Exhibitions, Science and Showmanship, 1840-1910, which is due to be published by Pickering and Chatto in 2012.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pettit, Fiona Yvette","Kember, Joe"],"dc:date":"2012-02-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":84996,"sim:weight":0.165835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109074,"sim:weight":0.15319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53655,"sim:weight":0.139667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":262419,"sim:weight":0.122641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109002,"sim:weight":0.113757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Thus, the media has been a potent weapon in the story of the Palestinian people’s struggle for freedom. This thesis examines the Hamas media strategy in three different periods, and in its historical and analytical context. The first period begins with the outbreak of the Palestinian intifada in 1987 and ends in 1993. In this period, Hamas was strictly a secret/underground organisation. The second stage is from 1994 to 2005. This period witnessed the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority in 1994 and the second intifada. The third period begins after the 2006 elections, where Hamas came to the power after its victory in the PLC elections. The thesis uses an empirical investigation, which relies on two qualitative methods: interviews and document analysis. It illustrates how the Hamas media strategy developed over the mentioned periods and outlines the overall media strategy. The research critically assesses four elements of the Hamas media strategy, which were the media message (discourse), the media objectives, the infrastructure, and the target audience. The present research concludes that Hamas, since 1987, has developed a media strategy based on the four mentioned elements. In particular, it finds that the idea of the resistance is the key element of the Hamas media discourse. Political and ideological/religious agendas and impulses drive Hamas’s discourse. Second, it finds there are two types of objectives tactical and strategic. The former are subject to the context, while the latter is based on ideological political agendas. Third, it finds there are five ‘circles’ of the target audience, which Hamas considers in its media strategy. Finally, it finds that the Hamas media infrastructure expanded from 1987 to the present by using the maximum capacity of the media outlets and benefited from the new media institutions under the rubric of the ‘independent media’. Overall, the thesis is the first in-depth academic study on Hamas\u0027 media strategy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abdelal, Wael","Sadiki, Larbi","Harcourt, Alison"],"dc:date":"2012-03-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

High quality exfoliated natural graphite and large area epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide are investigated with femtosecond and picosecond ultrafast pulses in the near--infrared. A bespoke technique for suspending exfoliated graphene is also presented.\n\nIn Chapter 3, the third--order nonlinear susceptibility of graphene is measured for the first time and shows a remarkably large response. Degenerate four--wave mixing at near--infrared wavelengths demonstrates an almost dispersionless emission over a broad spectral range. Quantum kinetic theory is employed to estimate the magnitude of the response and is in good agreement with the experimental data. The large susceptibility enables high contrast imaging, with a monolayer flake contrast of the order 10^{7} times higher than for standard reflection imaging. \n\nThe degenerate four--wave mixing technique is utilised in Chapter 4 to measure the interface carbon signal of epitaxially grown graphene on silicon carbide. Comparable third--order signal from the silicon carbide bulk prevents true interface imaging. Excluding the third--order emission from detection by elongating the emission to outside a band--pass filter range allows for pure interfacial luminescence imaging. Features within the two growth faces are investigated with Raman spectroscopy.\n\nNonlinear measurements are an increasingly popular tool for investigating fundamental properties of graphene. Chapter 5 investigates the influence of ultrafast pulses on the nonlinear response of graphene. High instantaneous intensities at the sample are shown to reduce the nonlinear emission by a factor or two. Comparing the Raman peak positions, widths and intensities before and after irradiation points to a huge doping of the samples, of the order 500 meV.\n\nIn Chapter 6 the relaxation of photoexcited carriers is measured via time--resolved pump--probe spectroscopy, where a layer dependence of hot phonon decay is observed. Single layer flakes are observed to relax faster than bilayers and trilayers, with an asymptote reached at approximately four layers. Removing the substrate and measuring fully suspended samples reveals the same trend, suggesting that substrate interactions are not the cause of the enhanced decay. The decay mechanism is therefore intrinsic to graphene, perhaps due to coupling to out--of--plane, flexural phonons. The thickness dependence of epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide is compared to that of exfoliated flakes where the layer dependence is not observed. Phonon relaxation times, however, are in good agreement.\n\nPredictions for future investigations into this novel material based on the works here are suggested in Chapter 7. Preliminary pump--probe measurements at high carrier concentrations are an example of such progress, which will offer an insight into further decay mechanisms in graphene.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hale, Peter John","Hendry, Euan"],"dc:date":"2012-03-29","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The cases of the AKP and the PKS show that both have different levels of moderation due to the different contexts of their social and political environments. The AKP has to deal with an extreme interpretation of secularism in Turkey that influences the party’s members to refrain from any confrontation with secular strongholds. The PKS has more freedom to express its ideology in the Indonesian democratic political system; hence the party is able to develop internal organisational procedures and programmes based on religious principles. To anticipate difficulties arising from from moderation, the AKP uses an organisational approach to give space for open and dynamic internal management and reduce the role of ideology significantly. The PKS still utilises its ideology in managing the impact of moderation by defining religious values as principles of organisation in parallel with organisational principles. Both parties are relatively successful in convincing their members to trust the party and its leaders in different ways. Party vision and personal charisma are more apparent for the AKP, although the PKS has to rely on interpretation of ideology as the main source of trust. By placing more emphasis on organisation, the AKP employs definition of violation toward party’s rules and decisions based on an organisational approach. In contrast, the definition of violation in the PKS relies on both religious and organisational principles. As a result, the AKP implements policies to dismiss members based on unambiguous principles with relatively insignificant opposition. The PKS has to deal with complaints of dismissal since the policies are taken based on interpretation of procedures and reasons. It is also proven that the AKP is able to convince voters by offering programmes to meet popular demands without relying on a religious agenda. While the PKS has been successful in developing an effective and solid party, it still has many problems in gaining support during elections as its pragmatic adjustment moderation also generates confusion internally and externally.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hidayat, Syahrul","Niblock, Tim"],"dc:date":"2012-01-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This ontology sees evolution as an epistemological concern, with every evolutionary act occurring as a response to environmental pressures and producing a knowledge of that environment. This knowledge, it will be argued, in light of conclusions drawn from an engagement with Object Oriented Ontology, can be tested only via repeatable successful action with that which might be known. Such evolutionary concerns, it will be further argued, are equally applicable to our artefacts.\n\tThe third chapter will focus on metaphor and critical theory to consider how e-reading in particular might function as a material metaphor, enabling productive thought.

Pursuing the ASEAN single market means that ASEAN shares with the European Union (EU) the common interests of developing regional economic integration, taking action to combat the cost of market fragmentation.\n\tThe aim of this thesis is to put forward suggestions directed at the realisation of the ASEAN single market in the field of economic integration and cooperation in the business sector based upon the experience of the EU in developing its internal market. To achieve this objective, the thesis investigates current conditions for business cooperation and collaboration and analyses existing barriers to effective cooperation in ASEAN. In the framework of a comparative analysis of the two regional developments where it is relevant, the analysis is mainly based on library-based research complemented by the socio-legal research method of interviewing ASEAN experts and also, businesses within ASEAN.\n\tThe major barriers identified in cross-border business activities are based on ASEAN Member Countries’ protectionist techniques to control foreign inward investments. The ‘ASEAN Way’ of consensus-based decision-making and a lack of   compliance and enforcement mechanisms and of working judicial institutions obstruct the development of efficient mechanisms for the purpose and also, the efficacy of the AEC initiatives and the ASEAN industrial economic cooperation schemes. Considering the limits of the related ASEAN instruments in facilitating corporate collaboration and promoting intra-ASEAN trade and investments, four different areas of mechanisms drawn from the EU’s experience are considered. After conducting an evaluation of the viability and the potential benefits of those mechanisms in ASEAN, the thesis proposes that the most useful area, promising practical benefits, would be the introduction of uniform and universally recognised business entities to facilitate collaboration and cooperation within ASEAN. Recognition of such entities as national entities within every Member Country will help to obviate these protectionist tendencies and improve the development of intra-ASEAN trade.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kim, Soyeon","Drury, Robert R.","Garde, Amandine"],"dc:date":"2011-07-19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The Gulf region and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the Southeast Asian region are the focus of study. The defence and security circumstances of the two regions and the responses of the regions’ governments severally and cooperatively are examined. The study has had to take account of the geographic, historical, ethno-cultural differences between the two regions. These are shown to be influential in their respective security responses. Nonetheless, the thesis demonstrates how the regions can be understood in terms of a common theoretical framework. \n\nThe study is undertaken primarily within the framework of the theory of ‘Regional Security Complex’ (RSCT), as developed by Buzan and Waever in Regions and Power. Regional security complexes are areas of internal “security interdependence” and securitisation. The theory (RSCT) is discussed critically. ‘Security Communities’ is a major comparative feature of the study. Amitav Acharya develops this approach in Constructing a Security Community in Southeast Asia. Emphasis is on the “creative construction” of a ‘security community’. The Gulf Cooperation Council may also be viewed in this way. ‘Regional security complex’ and ‘regional security community’ are not alternative theories of regional inter-state relations. The second is superstructural on the prior facts of regional security complexity. The GCC is a partial response to regional security and is a securitising actor in the region.  ASEAN is an attempt at region-wide inclusiveness and conflict avoidance.\n\nInstitutional management of security is described.  The two regional approaches differ as beliefs that the “enmity/amity balance” is amenable to official regional policy and action: the Gulf and GCC are apparently locked in a dominant ‘enmity’ scenario; ASEAN seeks to establish a regime of ‘amity’. Whether ASEAN is notably less militarily oriented than the Gulf is questioned. States’ insistence on national security ‘resilience’ and ASEAN norms of ‘sovereignty’, ‘non-interference’ and conflict avoidance’ impede regional security development. ASEAN’s progress towards an ‘ASEAN Security Community’ is examined. \n\nThe study discusses practicalities of these policies. The application and limitations of ‘Revolution in military affairs’ (RMA) are discussed. The military are viewed as a principal operational actor in any regional security response to conditions of regional security complexity. An examination of state-military relations is based on the concepts of ‘grand strategy’ and ‘military doctrine’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Khalifa, Talal Mohammed","Niblock, Tim"],"dc:date":"2012-03-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It is presented as a series of engagements with landscape, writing, and poetry; affective mapping, chasing memory-prompts, bookmarks and the shock of the poetic. The journeys seek to return to an ‘open’ idea of the geographical imagination, negating a negative, reductionist form of geography; shifting the focus away from sociologically determined notions of mobility. A resident of England for all his life, but with Welsh heritage, Edward Thomas believed he belonged nowhere. His texts: little time capsules, admixtures of social commentary, environmental action, and personal musings, are archaeological exercises, presenting a complicated picture of loss, demonstrating the value of artistic imagination. Loss - and subsequent estrangement from the world - would become his poetic source. This thesis is about trying to understand the relationship between poetry - indeed all ‘land writing’ - and place. How it affects in-place, what it does in-place? To understand this relationship properly it was necessary to consider why, as humans, we write? To find out what the subjective condition of the poet, or writer, emerges out of - in order to relay the experience of meeting poetry in-place. Edward Thomas began as a nature writer and became a poet after much agonizing. This made him a useful subject (object) (neither). Furthermore he suffered a long period of introspection and had a knowledge of Freud and psychoanalysis - which he underwent in 1912. This was played out in what Edna Longley (2008) terms; ‘poetic psychodrama.’ His poems often feature a split self or switch between patient and analyst (Longley, 2008). The Other Man, is his doppelganger, who he plays himself off against: the poems are, as such, multi-voiced, counterpointed, intersubjective. Deleuze and Guattari wrote in A Thousand Plateaus (1988: 3): ‘since each of us was already several, there was already quite a crowd.’ Edward Thomas knew this all too well. From the beginning of this ambulatory homage my psyche became inextricably linked with his.","bibo:AuthorList":["Riding, James Frank","Wylie, John","Romanillos, Pepe"],"dc:date":"2012-02-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

These are concerned with women’s feminist activism as well as with recognition and reconciliation approaches which address ethno-national contexts, and in particular the ongoing status of military occupation. In analysing their interconnections, my aim is to show their relevance to any strategies which have attempted to move beyond the current impasse towards the identification of effective peaceful political alternatives. In the course of this research, I take account of the most significant academic writing relevant to this area, and direct attention to those past and contemporary women’s initiatives which have striven to question such a reality.\nI underline the Palestinian and Israeli Jewish women’s role in tackling the major arguments concerning the ways through which diverse forms of ethno-nationalism have obstructed the achievement of recognition and reconciliation in the land of Palestine. In this framework, women’s and feminist critical positions have been at the core of socio-political activism, reflecting on alternatives for a meaningful resolution of the conflict. By examining the relevant material and by consideration of the outcomes of my fieldwork (mostly based on semi-structured interviews), I extend my study to both the historic practical examples and the philosophical debates, which seek to deconstruct the founding pillars of both nationalisms. \nBased around a critical analysis of the existing feminist literature, my research focuses on exploring viable political tools used by women activists to overcome conflicting ethno-national narratives, as well as to provide innovative approaches and practices applicable to the reconciliation process between Palestinians and Israeli Jews. Considering both parallel and joint women’s initiatives, and the internal heterogeneity within each side, my contribution seeks to highlight the importance of engaging with women’s and feminist activism in the Palestinian-Israeli background, since it can be seen as one of the few remaining political visions able to challenge the status quo. On an academic level, and also within peace-oriented movements, in spite of its difficulties and failures, the women’s feminist voice has continued to develop theoretical analyses along with practical approaches of resistance, in its attempt to counter the worsening of the ‘normalised’ reality in Palestine/Israel.","bibo:AuthorList":["Daniele, Giulia","Pappé, Ilan"],"dc:date":"2011-11-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The study grew out of some problems I was confronted with as part of my professional practice regarding the outcomes for children in a school that was failing to meet Government Targets in attainment.\nIn the study I worked with the staff and 9 – 11 year old children in six primary schools in rural, town, suburban and inner-city contexts. The total number of children was 305. The children were tested using the CASQ and YLOT and a range of other measures. Cronbach alpha internal consistency coefficients (coefficient alpha) and test-retest coefficients for the subscales and overall scale of the CASQ and YLOT were calculated. The validity of each measure was explored using evidence from: test content; internal structure; relations to other variables; and from the consequences of testing. Lastly the use of the YLOT as a proxy and nature of any associations between the measures used was explored looking at individual; school and community level data.\nThe study found that the YLOT has good psychometric properties and could be used as a basis for further work both professionally and for research. The Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient for the whole scale was 0.81. The psychometric properties of the CASQ were poor in that the subscales had very low reliability coefficients and the aggregated total scale reliability coefficient was still too low at 0.53 to be able to recommend the use of the CASQ. Before the CASQ could be used there would need to be extensive work to increase its reliability and validity through lengthening the test or changing the format of the questions to reduce their specificity.\nThe use of the YLOT as a proxy indicator of mental health and associations with school and community level data were discussed. The YLOT could provide an indication of well being particularly in relation to childhood depression. The community level data were not sensitive enough to discern hypothesised associations between communities and the children attending the schools sited in the communities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Richards, Andrew John","Norwich, Brahm","MacLeod, Flora"],"dc:date":"2012-02-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This paper is one of two. This study focused on YP with Social, Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties (SEBD) and their views and experiences of the system of support to help them remain in EET. An adapted co-operative inquiry (CI) methodology was employed which emphasised participation\nThis research aimed to address this gap by giving voice to the YP and their views of the education system. Additionally, the views of the YP were sought to deepen our understanding of YP’s needs and level of support they require to remain in EET.\nThe research took place in a unitary authority in the South West of England. The participants in paper one were five male students who had left specialist provision for YP with SEBD following completion of year 11. Ages ranged from 16.5-17 years. Their views were elicited through individual semi-structured interviews which were analysed using a thematic analysis approach (Braun and Clarke 2006).\nThe key finding from paper one was the value YP placed on relationships they formed with practitioners who supported them. For many of the YP Grovehill School (SEBD) was their first positive experience of the education system. The YP making the transition into mainstream EET expressed the view that there was no support in place once they left Grovehill. Additionally, the lack of practitioners in post-16 that\nknew and understood their needs, coupled with feelings of a lack of belonging and acceptance in their new environment, were identified as particularly challenging.\nThree out of the five participants became NEET before the end of their second year of post-16 EET. The YP identified the presence of Erica, a learning mentor as the most important source of support. However when the YP were unable to access Erica it was evident that the lack of a wider system of pastoral support presented as a significant challenge for this vulnerable group.\nFindings from papers one and two were assimilated and the implications for improving future policy and practice were considered in the final section of paper two. Consideration was also given to the role Educational Psychologists (EPs) and how EPs could inform future ways of partnership working to secure positive outcomes for YP with SEBD.\nPaper Two: An exploration of practitioner’s view of the current system of support for YP with SEBD making the transition into post-16 mainstream education, employment and/or training\nAbstract\nThe aim of this paper was to explore practitioner’s views and experiences of the system of support in place to meet the need of YP with SEBD making the transition from specialist to mainstream post-16 EET.\nThis small scale study was conducted in a unitary authority in the South West of England. A total of eleven participants took part in the semi structured interviews (six males and five females). The participants were selected to represent the range of provisions offered to YP with SEBD in post-16 EET. Semi-structured interviews were used to elicit their views. A thematic analysis approach to analysis was adopted.\nFindings were that practitioners identified the importance of cultivating caring relationships, however, a distinction emerged in the FE setting were the focus was on behaving like an adult and conforming to an existing system. Disparities also emerged between settings value and beliefs systems, which appeared to shape the teaching practice and interaction with YP. The lack of support practitioners receive from outside agencies to understand and support YP with SEBD emerged as important factor. Additionally, issues such as the impact of the change of environment from specialist to mainstream EET and school culture emerged as salient features. The dilemma of inclusion versus attainment was found to be a significant\nchallenge for practitioners when trying to meet the needs of the YP. Findings which related specifically to transition identified; across settings there was a lack of a formal transition plan and limited access to resources and funding in post-16 settings. Within FE settings the lack of accessible pastoral support was identified as a key area for development. Finally, all participants identified the need for a clear strategic vision to inform future practice.\nSystems theory provided a useful conceptual framework to understand the complexity of the interlinked factors which impact on YP access, or lack of access to support to help them remain in EET. Shared themes were identified across the phases of the study which identified that it is not one single factor, but rather a combination of interlinked factors which contribute to YP becoming NEET. The information gathered showed participants across the settings recognised the need for greater partnership working and help for practitioners to help them understand and support YP with SEBD. The study also illuminated the need for better communication between practitioners and the wider system of support. Additionally, the study identified a clear role for EPs in supporting YP and practitioners and implications for EP role are discussed. The study has provided a timely insight into the current system of support for YP with SEBD in light of the move for YP to remain in EET up until the age of 18.","bibo:AuthorList":["O\u0027Sullivan, Lorraine Mary","Maxwell, Tim","Richards, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2011-09-30","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This thesis will explore and analyze factors and reasons behind the problem of the cohesion of the Islamic political parties by associating it with the existence of party institutionalization. For this purpose, this thesis would be a study of comparative institutionalization of Islamic political parties, particularly between the National Wakening Party (PKB) and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS). PKB is a good exemplar for an Islamic party that experienced severely fragmented parties. In fact, this party has became the largest among Islamic political parties and including one of the worst fragmentations among all new political parties in Indonesia. Meanwhile, PKS has been able to maintain its internal discipline and unity, although factionalism and fragmentation have become commonplace during the first decade of the Reform Era. This thesis believes that the more a party have been institutionalized, which is indicated by the existence of procedural leadership in decision-making process, the effectiveness of internal conflict resolution mechanism, the continuation of systematic cadrerization and the commitment to the shared values, there is a bigger chance of the party to preserve its cohesion. On the other hand, the less a party have been institutionalized which is indicated by the ineffectiveness of procedural leadership, the failure of internal conflict resolution mechanism, the impediment of systematic cadrerization, and the failure to provide ideology as the guidance of policy and uniting values, there is more possibility for the party to be fragmented.","bibo:AuthorList":["Noor, Firman","Niblock, Tim","Nonneman, Gerd"],"dc:date":"2012-03-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

All passages containing these words from the time period were located, translated and analysed according to specific criteria concerning the usage and interpretation of the term. The resulting exploration was then split into five main sections: physical compulsion, moral compulsion, cosmology, circumstantial compulsion and the personification of compulsion. These sections were then examined according to both context and subtle differences in the meaning of ἀνάγκη terms within these contexts. The vast majority concerned some form of violence, physical force or fear of violent repercussions. Although the focus was on the interpretation of texts dating to before 400 BCE, owing to their fragmentary nature but considerable importance, the cosmological texts had to be examined in conjunction with later texts in order to shed more light on the meaning of ἀνάγκη in this context. Statistical analysis was performed on the 466 texts located and they were further analysed to track variations across time and genre-specific usages. Several types of usage were seen to develop only towards the end of the fifth century after 450 BCE including the notion of relative compulsions; the necessity for revenge and compelled alliances were seen to develop at this time. Recommendations were made with regards to the best and most appropriate translations; the majority of passages would require either the translation of coercion, constraint or compulsion for ἀνάγκη with the exception of the adjectival ἀναγκαίος which can mean blood relatives or similarly obligated individuals. The translation of necessity, although generally the given interpretation of ἀνάγκη was seldom appropriate since it did not grasp the entire meaning of the term in context.","bibo:AuthorList":["Green, Alison Clare","Seaford, Richard"],"dc:date":"2012-02-28","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It investigates the inherent contradictions in the position of EMP in an Arab-medium university by drawing on the socio-political and economic factors shaping English language education policy in Syria. It also critiques “mainstream” ESP through examining the “purpose” in English for Medical Purposes. Rather than viewing learning as an end product, this study suggests that learning English is part of a dynamic process of learning to become a doctor in Syria and as part of constructing the 21st Century Syrian “doctor” identity.\n I draw on aspects of poststructuralism and complexity theory to take the analysis of English for Specific Purposes beyond issues of needs analysis, content, and materials development. ESP, from its outset, has been proposed for decades as a commodity that meets students’ linguistic and communicative needs. However important these concerns are for the development of the discipline, as I argue in this thesis, ESP seems to adopt a “mechanistic” approach by predetermining “needs” and “purposes” which fails to account for the complexity of human beings’ behaviours and responses in educational contexts. The deterministic conceptualisation of ESP places rigid boundaries between ESP and the reality of the medicine profession, therefore, fails to meet students’ needs which transcend boundaries of classroom in aspiration for recognition by the medical community worldwide. English for Medical Purposes, in this study, goes beyond “specific purposes” to account for the role of English as a foreign language in constructing doctor identity and in the process of becoming a doctor.\n Data in this qualitative research were collected through focus groups with students of medicine in Tishreen University, semi-structured interviews with medical tutors and management officials in the Faculty of Medicine and the Higher Institute of Languages, as well as ESP teachers. Policy documents were analysed, and field notes were taken in classroom and hospital observations. Based on the analysis of these sources, a deeper understanding of EMP at Tishreen University is reached through the lens of poststructuralism and complexity theory. Finally, this thesis ends by drawing an ESP/Applied Linguistics relationship among the implications the findings have for policy makers, teachers and medical students, alongside recommendations for future ESP research directions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Farhat, Dima","Wright, Anthony","Osberg, Deborah"],"dc:date":"2012-04-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

For this end, the study attempts to answer questions like how Turkey can manage to be European, whether it has a sufficiently strong civil society, how a country that has suffered from a lack of civil actors participating in the democratic process could be accepted into the EU, and whether, and how, the country has changed since its application decades ago.  \n\n          In analyzing the role of Turkish civil society, this thesis establishes a general historical framework of Turkey’s relations with the European Union.

Public and Private Representations of Men and Marriage 1770 - 1830","bibo:abstract":"Men have been largely absent from the literature of eighteenth-century matrimony, their role and performance being inferred from examination of female experience. The aim of this thesis is to remedy that omission by exploring two representational forms:  the public - contained in fiction, advice literature, periodical, newspaper and adultery case reports; and the private, a range of unpublished correspondence and diaries, almost all of which are being cited for the first time. Together, the two bodies of material reinforce the cultural history of developing affectivity which has been one of the principal trends of work within both history and criticism over the last 40 years. They focus attention on the domestic environment increasingly occupied by men, and the effect of this emphasis on perceptions of masculinity. In these respects they support the drive of historians such as Amanda Vickery and Karen Harvey to “write men back into a history from which they have been written out”. Critical reflections and the place of fiction and other literature as sources of social history comprise a second strand of the thesis. A third area of concentration will be the influence of public media on personal behaviour. Historical research into various aspects of contemporary culture – including domestic violence, prostitution, children’s upbringing – have explored what people did without exploring the rhetorical influences that might explain why people did things. Direct evidence of reading practices and therefore of these effects is limited but nonetheless important.\nWith its focus on marriage and after an Introduction that sets out some of the key issues, the thesis is divided into two parts: Before Marriage and After Marriage. Within each part there is further division into chapters devoted respectively to considerations of relations between men and women to be found in the public prints and those available through correspondence and diaries archived in a number of local Record Offices.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fielding, Michael","Spencer, Jane","Power, Henry"],"dc:date":"2012-02-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
