The story of the burnt-down roundhouse (trench D) became increasingly clear, with the smaller underlying roundhouse (c. 12.5m in diameter) more fully exposed and the structure of the later ring-ditch house revealed. A key discovery was that part of the building had been reused prior to its destruction, with structural modifications and intense activity in the south-east of what was by then a fairly ramshackle building.  After the fire, a cobbled surface was laid over the area; this may have been the focus for the Pictish activity on the site, as later scooped buildings seem to be ranged around this yard.\r\nTrench AH examined a well-preserved ring-ditch house some 15.5 m in diameter.  Unusual features included a monumental double-door entrance, one side of which was closed off or restricted, and a partition separating the entrance passage from the ring ditch.  At the end of the house\u0027s life a series of pits was dug across the dooreay, with burnt material being deposited in them and in the ring ditch.  this is probably a symbolic decommisioning of the structure.  The trench also produced our best evidence yet for Pictish buildings. The vestigial remains are best interpreted as floor hollows from two buildings at right angles, with associated features suggesting a cruck roof and a central hearth.  A range of striking finds in this trench included a painted pebble, a glass marble or pin head and a short dagger in its sheath.\r\nA return to the area west of the coin hoards finally confirmed that a large ring ditch house lurked there too, wiht the 2000 hoard directly in front of its ?blocked doorway.  Over this was a series of spreads, rich in charcoal and clay, which probably represent demolition debris from an unrelated later structure in the vicinity; the area was subsequently levelled by cobblilng.  Elsewhere in the trench, a much smaller post-ring building some 5 m in diameter was found.\r\nIn a separate campaign, the medieval corn-drying kiln previously sampled in 2004 was more fully exposed and found to be well-preserved.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hunter, Fraser"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":97583,"sim:weight":0.593364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97594,"sim:weight":0.563554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1397390,"sim:weight":0.184596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57243,"sim:weight":0.152219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10461,"sim:weight":0.141232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666123,"sim:weight":0.13796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48272,"sim:weight":0.0935466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50219,"sim:weight":0.0932025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109144,"sim:weight":0.0869379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50006,"sim:weight":0.0774547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":134981,"sim:weight":0.075088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11144,"sim:weight":0.0691771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108591,"sim:weight":0.0691309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108731,"sim:weight":0.0647274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710492,"sim:weight":0.0637984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One of these is probably earlier than the coins, which indicated the hoard was not a one-off contact.

The site is known from aerial photographs, and metal detecting has recovered part of a Roman silver coin hoard.  Results so far suggest this was an important site during the Iron Age, with substantial houses and a rich finds assemblage.  There was also a sizeable Medieval settlement in the field, perhaps due to its proximity to Birnie Kirk.\r\nFieldwork in 2000 had three aims - to examine another area of the settlement; to continue the metal-detecting survey; and to try to locate the remainder of the Roman hoard.  Stripping of an area some 26 x 27 m revealed the remains of at least four Iron Age roundhouses and a probable workshop.  There was also a Medieval building and yard overlying further Iron Age remains.  In places the deposits are well-preserved and have not suffered badly from ploughing.  Dating those features should be a big help in understanding the development of the site during the Iron Age.\r\nMetal-detecting revealed a range of finds including part of an Iron Age bridle bit,an unusual discovery whcih points again to the importance of the site.  Excavation of trial trenches at the findspots of the two Roman brooches found in 1999 drew a blank, and these seem to be isolated finds.\r\nPlotting the findspots of coins found in previous years showed a concentration in one area of the field.  A trench was excavated here and the remains of the hoard were found, still in the pot it was buried in.  The hoard contained over 300 denarii, ending with coins of Septimus Severus of AD 196-7.  Careful excavation recovered organic remains associated with the hoard - a lining of bracken, and fragments of leather and string possibly from a lid or pouch.  The hoard is one of a number known from Scotland north of the Antonine Wall, and is best seen as part of a Roman policy of giving gifts or bribes to powerful chiefs in return for their loyalty.  Many questions remain, in particular why the hoard was buried there, and further work in 2001 will try to tackle this problem.\r\nTrial excavations beside Birnie kirkyard wall found no sign of an earlier enclosure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hunter, Fraser"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":97583,"sim:weight":0.593364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97594,"sim:weight":0.563554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57243,"sim:weight":0.152219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1397390,"sim:weight":0.149793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666123,"sim:weight":0.13796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48272,"sim:weight":0.0935466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50219,"sim:weight":0.0932025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50006,"sim:weight":0.0774547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":134981,"sim:weight":0.075088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11144,"sim:weight":0.0691771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108591,"sim:weight":0.0691309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109144,"sim:weight":0.0678732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108731,"sim:weight":0.0647274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710492,"sim:weight":0.0637984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Fieldwork in 2001 had four aims: to test the presence of a palisade east of the site; examine two further sets of cropmarks; explore the setting of the hoard; and continue the metal-detecting survey.\r\nThe palisade had been suggested from aerial photographs, but extensive trial-trenching found no trace of it.  This allowed the eastern boundary of the settlement to be established, giving it a sizeable area of some 150 x 110 m.\r\nTwo trenches examining cropmark traces revealed the remains of three Iron Age roundhouses.  These had unusually well-preserved occupation deposits.  Dating these will be important in clarifying the date range and nature of the site.\r\nExamining a large area to the west of the 2000 coin hoard showed that it lay in an area of dense occupation, close to a substantial roundhouse.  Owing to the complexity of the remains they were only partly disentangled.  Completely unexpected was the discovery of a second Roman silver coin hoard, only 10 m away from the first.  This is unparalleled in Scotland, and raises all kinds of questions about how long-lived the contact with Rome was, and why the hoards were buried here.  Further work is planned to tackle some of these issues.\r\nMetal-detecting produced a range of finds which expand our picture of the site.  Most notable was an intact and unusual Roman brooch, the third from the site, which shows that there was contact with Rome over some time.  Finds from the Medieval settlement overlying the Iron Age one were also recovered, including a silver coin and lead spindle whorls.

In the Roman Iron Age it was a key centre in the local area, in touch with the Roman powers to the south; this is seen in a range of Roman goods, notably two hoards of late second century silver coins, part of a policy of bribing the tribes beyond the frontier to keep the Roman frontier secure.\r\nIn 2003 the final small-scale season of exploratory excavations took place, setting the scene for larger-scale work in future years.  The main focus was on a large ring-ditch roundhouse, c. 15.5 m in diameter, which had been partly exposed in 2001.  The structure appeared to be single-phase with an entrance to the ENE; the central cooking pit had gone through several different forms.  The good preservation of the remains meant the excavation was not finished, and it will be continued in 2004.\r\nThe sequence of deposites uncovered in 2002 over the southern roundhouse in trench O was also explored.  This turned out to be a complex series of events later than the roundhouse, associated with a hearth and cooking pits.  It probably lay within a rectangular post-built building.\r\nAnother focus was on the non-circular buildings on the site, which appeared on aerial photographs as sub-rectangular \"blobs\".  These are likely to represent a medieval settlement, but a key question is whether this building type stretches back into the Pictish period, providing a continuity with the earlier settlement.  Two blobs were sectioned in 2003.  Neither produced artefactual dating evidence, but both had charcoal-rich layers suitable for radiocarbon dating.  Both comprise worn sub-rectangular hollows subsequently filled with ash-and charcoal-rich debris.

It was a two-phase structure with very insubstantial foundations, a worn sub-rectangular floor hollow, and a central cooking pit later replaced by an external one.  To the north lay an iron-working areas, as yet of unknown date.\r\nOne roundhouse (area M) was of ring-groove construction, 11.5 m in diameter, with an internal structural post ring.  The wall was probably of wattle panels, with a more solid post-built structure flanking the east-facing double door.  It had a central cooking pit surrounded by various other features, with a series of radial chambers or small rooms around the edges.  The deposits within the building come mostly from its demolition; at this point cattle skulls were placed in it as votive offerings.

The main focus was a large house (c. 16 m in diameter), occupied around the time of the coin hoards, which had burnt down and was very well-preserved.  Its full extent was exposed, with an entrance to the south-east, central hearth and internal ring of large structural posts.  Preservation was best to the rear, where a ring-ditch lay against the outer wall.  In the western half of the building the destruction deposits revealed burnt turfs from the roof and substantial charred timber fragments from the structure of the building.  In the eastern half the layers overlying these burnt deposits were removed.  Finds included Iron Age yellow glass beads, a sherd of Roman coarse ware (the first Roman pot from Birnie), and two pieces of cannel coal jewellery, another first for the site.  These show the inhabitants had connections across the Moray Firth - the nearest source of raw materials is Golspie in Sutherland.\r\nAnother house partly examined in 2000 was fully exposed.  Any internal features had been ploughed away, but a three-phase ring-groove 13.8 m in diameter was revealed, with an eastern entrance.  It is probably a house which was reused as an enclosure.\r\nExcavation of a sub-rectangular feature showed it was the sunken floor of a turf-walled building with no earth-fast foundations.  It went through a series of phases, the lateste with a cobbled floor.  Similar features have been interpreted as medieval, but the finds from this structure suggest a late Iron Age of Pictish date.

A series of pits contained fragments of clay crucibles and moulds for axes pins and bangles.  One pit contained the charred remains of a large oak object, perhaps a charred tree trunk from use as an anvil.  In another pit, saddle quern and rubber fragments had been deliberately buried, apparently as part of a ritual.\r\nA successful series of visits for local schools was held, and around 300 people attended an Open Day.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hunter, Fraser"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":97583,"sim:weight":0.593364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97594,"sim:weight":0.563554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1569183,"sim:weight":0.222503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1569188,"sim:weight":0.194703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57243,"sim:weight":0.152219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1397390,"sim:weight":0.149793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666123,"sim:weight":0.13796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48272,"sim:weight":0.0935466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50219,"sim:weight":0.0932025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50006,"sim:weight":0.0774547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":134981,"sim:weight":0.075088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11144,"sim:weight":0.0691771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108591,"sim:weight":0.0691309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109144,"sim:weight":0.0678732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108731,"sim:weight":0.0647274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710492,"sim:weight":0.0637984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Good progress was made with the burnt-down roundhouse - the layers are complex, interleaved and varied, but they tell fascinating stories.  Many of them derive from burnt turf, and it seems both walls and roof were turf-built, with collapsed wattle revetting from the inner wall face found at the base of the deposits.  In place some possible floor deposits survived, but there is little sign of occupation debris.  As a result, finds were sparse but choice - notably the terminal of a gold ribbon torc and an exotic amber bead, confirming the site\u0027s status.\r\nThe late Bronze Age metalworking area located in 2005, was explored more thoroughly.  There is no substantial workshop structure, and the activity was quite ephemeral.  Two curved slots are probably temporary shelters or wind breaks.  Along with mould fragments for pins, bangles and axes was debris from spearheads and perhaps swords.  This will be a key assemblage for this period.\r\nTo the north-east, a possible iron-working area first seen in 2004 was examined.  This revealed a well-preserved iron-smelting furnace complex, with stone foundations and a clay superstructure.  It had met a catastrophic end, with the clay walls collapsing.  A shallow horseshoe-shaped erosion gully aligned on the furnace probably arises from associated activity.  In the south-west of the trench, a four-post structure was found, probably a typically Iron Age grain storage building.\r\nTowards the north-west corner of the site, a large trench was opened over the remains of a possible medieval building exposed in 2000.  This proved hard to trace, but a massive later prehistoric ring-ditch house was found.  Within the house are a pair of clay iron-smelting furnaces, though they may not be contemporary with the building.

{"identifier":97580,"ep:Repository":76,"dc:type":["Monograph","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Excavations at Birnie, Moray, 2007.","bibo:abstract":"The 2007 excavations at the later prehistoric site at Birnie examined four areas.  Continued excavation of the burnt-down roundhouse (trench D) revealed extensive remains of chared timbers from the roof and possibly an upper floor.  Substantial structural posts were also found, some squared; other structural elements included a mortice and tenon joint.  Finds included a range of glass beads, a rotary quern stone and a series of stone tools.  The bulk of the destruction deposits in the western half have now been excavated, revealing the ring groove of an earlier, smaller house.  The south-east quadrant was also examined, with removal of the much less extensive destruction deposits revealing a series of large pits and an oval stone feature, yet to be excavated.  In the north-east quadrant, there are hints of an overlying rectangular structure defined by slight cobbeled spreads.\r\nContinued excavation of the large ring-ditch house examined in 2000 and 2006 (trench AB) revealed a series of rebuilds, with evidence of at least three structures c.18-19m in diameter on the same site.  Two had eastern entrances, but at one stage there was a north-westerly doorway.  There were no surviving floor deposits, but finds suggest a later Iron Age date. The pair of iron-smelting furnaces found in 2006 were shown to post-date the house.  They may be connected with other later features, including a paved arc and a series of post-sockets, perhaps of medieval date.\r\nThe third trench (AF) examined the area where the coin hoards came from.  This confirmed there were no structures connected with the hoards, and revealed two other unusual deposits: a pit with a high-quality barely-used whetstone at its base, and another pit with an intact inverted Iron Age pot.  Unusually for the area, it was decorated.  These and previous finds support the notion that this area was a focus for votive offerings.  The hoards and the two finds from this year are near-equally spaced on a slightly curving line.\r\nThe final trench (AG), to the south-west of previously excavated areas, produced very few features, confirming the limits of the site in this direction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hunter, Fraser"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":97583,"sim:weight":0.593364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97594,"sim:weight":0.563554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1569183,"sim:weight":0.222503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1569188,"sim:weight":0.194703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1397390,"sim:weight":0.186367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57243,"sim:weight":0.152219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10461,"sim:weight":0.14414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666123,"sim:weight":0.13796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74638,"sim:weight":0.122426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108731,"sim:weight":0.0950628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48272,"sim:weight":0.0935466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50219,"sim:weight":0.0932025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109144,"sim:weight":0.0873769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50006,"sim:weight":0.0774547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":134981,"sim:weight":0.075088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11144,"sim:weight":0.0691771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108591,"sim:weight":0.0691309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710492,"sim:weight":0.0637984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":97582,"ep:Repository":76,"dc:type":["Book Section","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Electric Telegraph to e-Scotland: Networking remote and rural communities","bibo:abstract":"There are said to be parallels in the impact that the advent of the telegraph and the internet had on their respective societies.  This chapter looks at two examples of state intervention and subsidy in the development of those two communications infrastructures in remote and rural areas of Scotland, at either end of the revolution in electric communications. Both applied the technology of the day to break down geographical barriers, to increase connectivity, to spread information, and to enhance social and business links. Both initiatives grew in part out of a government concern that Scotland should not fall behind the level of technological provision available in other European countries, thereby disadvantaging Scottish business as well as citizens (a comparison with the state-owned telegraph systems in Belgium, Switzerland and France informed the 1868 Telegraph Act, and the development of a broadband infrastructure across a range of European Union countries has been quoted by the Scottish Government). The emphasis in both cases was on affordable wide-ranging availability to benefit individuals as much as business, though with an understanding that business needs would be the driver and would provide the bulk of the finance to establish and maintain the infrastructure.  \r\nThe first was a product of nationalisation with the expansion of the telegraph network from 1870 to 1872 driven by demand. Following is an analysis of that demand and its impact, alongside a description of the development of the network across remote and rural areas over the two years of the scheme. \r\nThe second examines the rationales behind Scottish Government initiatives since 2001 to extend broadband provision and outlines the technical solutions devised in partnership with commercial operators and funding bodies to reach non-commercially viable areas and to stimulate take up.","bibo:AuthorList":["Taubman, Alison","Veitch, Kenneth"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":758551,"sim:weight":0.506031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52988,"sim:weight":0.482968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1928322,"sim:weight":0.476745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710017,"sim:weight":0.4737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95181,"sim:weight":0.47347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93252,"sim:weight":0.471858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":197869,"sim:weight":0.461116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93350,"sim:weight":0.460273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60413,"sim:weight":0.458252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94106,"sim:weight":0.454372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60387,"sim:weight":0.451773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46134,"sim:weight":0.451118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93339,"sim:weight":0.448943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":212524,"sim:weight":0.446423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15207,"sim:weight":0.444657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95752,"sim:weight":0.42557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84828,"sim:weight":0.419338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.418645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930159,"sim:weight":0.418238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60357,"sim:weight":0.415934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Several showed signs of later activity. Trench AL looked at burnt deposits uncovered in a previous trial trench. It revealed a substantial ring-ditch house, 16 m in diameter, which had been repaired and rebuilt before burning down, preserving some wonderful structural charcoal. Later activity in the same area included two stone hearths. In the east part of the trench, a small post-ring was located from a house c.7.6 m in diameter. In the SW corner a rectangular erosion scoop, perhaps a yard, was found. Isolated features included one which had a large fragment of a fired clay structure, perhaps from a kiln or furnace, dumped in it.\r\nFurther work on the trench D burnt-down house confirmed the phasing from 2008, and added further detail- notably what seems to be a collapsed partition from the reuse of the building. To the east, trench AM produced another burnt-down ring-ditch house, c. 13.5 m in diameter. Again there was evidence of later activity, with a hearth set into the destruction deposits, although with no surviving trace of any associated structure. Trench AN returned to roundhouse N and revealed a complex, lengthy sequence of post-roundhouse use, including hints of an overlying, lightly built structure around a cooking pit.\r\nAn unusual house was revealed in trench AP. This exposed a building which seems to have two entrances. It comprises a ring-groove 10.2 m in diameter, with no internal post-ring for support the wall took all the weight. Again there was evidence of activity after the house had become structurally unsound. Two further trenches (AO and AQ) confirmed the eastern extent of the site, with a marked fall-off in feature density. AO included an enigmatic small enclosure with a large pit dug through its centre.\r\nAmong a rich range of finds, pride of place goes to a Romano-British penannular brooch from trench AM.\r\nIn a separate, short season earlier in the year, further work was carried out on the medieval corn kiln on the site\u0027s western edge, while a trial trench down the hill on which Birnie Kirk sits revealed a tantalising wealth of archaeology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hunter, Fraser"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":97583,"sim:weight":0.593487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97594,"sim:weight":0.56367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133532,"sim:weight":0.30285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1569183,"sim:weight":0.222087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1569188,"sim:weight":0.194744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57243,"sim:weight":0.15225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1397390,"sim:weight":0.149807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666123,"sim:weight":0.137007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48272,"sim:weight":0.0936874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50219,"sim:weight":0.0932218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50006,"sim:weight":0.0774707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108591,"sim:weight":0.0692343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109144,"sim:weight":0.0679609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108731,"sim:weight":0.0648572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710492,"sim:weight":0.0631972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":97588,"ep:Repository":76,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Hugh Miller: fossils, landscape and literary geology","bibo:abstract":"The bicentenary of the birth of Hugh Miller (1802–1856) in Cromarty (in northern Scotland) has enabled a reappraisal of this fine spare-time geologist, in turn stonemason and banker, and eventually Edinburgh newspaper editor. In Cromarty he had the usual advantages and limitations of a local collector far from metropolitan centres. But Miller was different from other collectors: he was author of classic books such as The Old Red Sandstone, making famous the Old Red Sandstone fishes and Jurassic marine fossils of the area around Cromarty. Miller’s ironically titled autobiography My Schools and Schoolmasters recommended geology as an improving recreation. His writings are suffused with the thrill of discovery and the wonder and beauty of fossils, inspiring future geologists such as John Muir (1838–1914), pioneer of environmental conservation, and George Jennings Hinde (1839–1918), microfossil researcher. In his often autobiographical writings Miller made geology an integral part of the world as he saw it: he was not ‘just’ a ‘popularizer’, but (as he always wanted) a literary man in the all-encompassing Victorian manner. Geology merged with local history and folklore - all ‘libraries’ of the past. But his writings remain rooted in insightful observation – as scientist and poet – of specimen and scenery, from microscope slide to landscape, and in careful reconstruction, for instance, of fossil animals from fragmentary remains. When Miller dealt with wider issues of God in creation and the truths of geology, he deployed his fossils, as in Footprints of the Creator (1849) which attacked the reheated Lamarckian evolutionism of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844). But, contrary to the common misconception that he was driven to suicide by a conflict between science and religion, Miller simply saw these as different facets of the same truth. Indeed, he notably defended geology against religious literalists. Miller’s fossil collection is now mostly in the National Museums of Scotland, Edinburgh, with some specimens in the new Hugh Miller museum, Cromarty, which derives from that founded by his son, also called Hugh (1850–1896), a professional geologist with the Geological Survey. This appraisal reveals further depths to Hugh Miller’s appreciation of geological specimens, and to the significance of his surviving collection. Miller’s relationship with the material world of objects shows remarkable consistency and an unwillingness to compartmentalize: Miller’s fossils exemplify the deep continuity of his world.","bibo:AuthorList":["Knell, Simon J.","Taylor, Michael A"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J L R Agassiz.

Rogadines attack a variety of both macro- and microlepidopteran taxa, although the speciose genus Aleiodes almost exclusively attacks macrolepidopterans. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic history of the Rogadinae, revise their higher-level classification and assess the evolution of their host ranges and mummy types. We also assess the divergence times within the subfamily and discuss the reasons for the extraordinary evolutionary diversification of Aleiodes.\r\nResults: Our Bayesian analyses weakly support the monophyly of the subfamily. A clade comprising all Aleiodes species and some other taxa is not nested within the tribe Rogadini as previously supposed, but instead is recovered as sister to the Yeliconini,with the remaining Rogadini genera being recovered as sister to the Stiropiini. The Rogadinae is estimated to have originated during the mid to late Eocene, 36.1–51.62 MYA. Molecular dating gives a more recent origin for the Aleiodes clade (17.98–41.76 MYA) compared to the origins proposed for two of its principal lepidopteran host groups (Noctuidae: 60.7–113.4 MYA; Geometridae 48–62 MYA). The Bayesian ancestral reconstruction of the emergence habits from the mummified hosts weakly recovered an anterior emergence as the ancestral condition for the subfamily. Producing a hard mummy has evolved at various times independently, though most of the species with this biology belong to the Aleiodes clade.\r\nConclusion: Based on our results, we erect the tribe Aleiodini nov. to include Aleiodes and Heterogamus stat. rev. Cordylorhogas, Pholichora and Hemigyroneuron are synonymised with Aleiodes. The molecular dating of clades and the ancestral reconstruction of host ranges support the hypothesis that radiation within Aleiodes s. s. was due to host recruitment leading to host range expansion followed by speciation, and not to parasitoid-host coevolution. Within the Rogadinae, variation in the site of emergence from the mummified host probably evolved as a consequence of the mummy\u0027s site and mode of formation, and the extent of mummy tanning/hardness to the degree of protection needed in relation to the cost of providing it.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shaw, Mark R"],"dc:date":"2008-12-03","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Godfray HCJ Parasitoids.

{"identifier":97591,"ep:Repository":76,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Charles W. Peach, palaeobotany and Scotland","bibo:abstract":"The move south from Wick to the city of Edinburgh in 1865, some four years after retirement from the Customs service, provided Charles W. Peach with new opportunities for fossil-collecting and scientific networking. Here he renewed and maintained his interest in natural history and made significant palaeobotanical collections from the Carboniferous of the Midland Valley of Scotland. These are distinguished by some interesting characteristics of their documentation which the following generations of fossil collectors and researchers would have done well to emulate. Many of his fossil plant specimens have not only the locality detail,but also the date, month and year of collection neatly handwritten on attached paper labels; as a result, we can follow Peach\u0027s collecting activities over a period of some 18 years or so. Comments and even illustrative sketches on the labels of some fossils give us first-hand insight into Peach\u0027s observations. Study of these collections now held in National Museums Scotland reveals a pattern of collecting heavily biased towards those localities readily accessible from the newly expanding railways which provided a relatively inexpensive and convenient means of exploring the geology of the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.\r\nCharles W. Peach had a very \u0027hands-on\u0027 practical approach to scientific investigation which led him to construct novel glass plates with mounted Sphenopteris cuticle, removed intact from Lower Carboniferous shales and limestones originating in West Lothian. These resemble the herbarium sheets with which he was familiar from his parallel and highly significant work on extant flora including nearshore marine algae. He also prepared hand ground glass microscope slides,particularly of permineralised plant material from Pettycur in Fife, using whatever materials he had to hand at the time. Peach\u0027s collection raises questions about the evolution of accepted standards of documentation in private collections, in parallel with the evolution of collecting practices by the new professionals such as the workers of the Geological Survey. Its relatively rapid deposition in museums,compared to many private collections, may also have contributed to its apparently high rate of usage by contemporary workers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Anderson, Lyall I","Taylor, Michael A"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D A ALLAN.

Recent analytical developments are summarised for different glass composition and practical examples are given. The paper describes how to extract compositional information from the glass, first based on the spectra profile to distinguish rapidly alkali silicate from alkaline-earth alkali silicate and lead alkali silicate glass, then using the spectral decomposition and correlations to extract quantitative data. For alkali silicate glasses, that are most prone to alteration, the spectral characteristics are described to interpret the alteration process (selective leaching or dissolution of the glass) from the Raman spectra of the altered glass. These developments have greatly widened the potential of the technique and supplement well its ability to measure the thickness of the altered layer and identify the crystalline deposits.","bibo:AuthorList":["Robinet, L.","Neff, D.","Bouquillon, A.","Pagès-Camagna, S.","Verney-Carron, A.","Etcheverry, M.-P.","Tate, Jim"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D E Clark, C G Pantano and L L Hench.

The treasure is the largest and most important hoard of late Roman silver from beyond the edge of the Roman empire and was reported intensively by the excavator, Alexander Curle in “The Treasure of Traprain” in 1923 and in the archaeological literature. It was quickly put on display in the museum in Edinburgh following a year of intensive restoration by a firm of Edinburgh silversmiths. The treasure consists of over 160 pieces of silver and silver gilt, remarkable in that while most of the pieces are items of silver that have been cut up and flattened and can be described as hacksilber some of the pieces remained much more complete, one bowl remaining untouched.\r\nThe reason for the treasure being hoarded has be the subject of much speculation over the years. Why did such a collection of precious objects get destroyed and eventually\r\nend up in a pit within a small settlement? Was it the wealth won from the Romans by a Barbarian pirate? Or was it bullion from some diplomatic negotiations between the\r\nRomans and the native population? Or perhaps part of the stock of a trader or local craftsman?\r\nThe status of the Traprain Treasure is currently the subject of a international archaeological study. To shed some light on the silver itself we have engaged on a\r\ntechnological study of the pieces.

Are possible immigrants identifiable, as was the case with the Amesbury Archer? The Project will investigate 250 sets of remains, from five geochemically-contrasting areas – namely eastern Scotland, Yorkshire, the Peak District, Wessex and Wales – using osteology, dental microwear, histology and pathology, and isotopic analysis of tooth enamel and bone (with carbon and nitrogen in bone providing information about diet, strontium and oxygen in tooth enamel providing information about mobility, and sulphur in bone providing information about coastal vs. non-coastal residence). A subset of the 250 individuals is to be radiocarbon-dated, to improve our understanding of Beaker chronology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sheridan, J A","Parker Pearson, Mike","Jay, Mandy","Richards, Mike","Curtis, Neil"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"DL Clarke.

{"identifier":2796817,"ep:Repository":76,"dc:type":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The age of Stonehenge","bibo:abstract":"Stonehenge is the icon of British prehistory, and continues to inspire ingenious investigations and interpretations. A current campaign of research, being waged by probably the strongest archaeological team ever assembled, is focused not just on the monument, but on its landscape, its hinterland and the monuments within it. The campaign is still in progress, but the story so far is well worth reporting. Revisiting records of 100 years ago the authors demonstrate that the ambiguous dating of the trilithons, the grand centrepiece of Stonehenge, was based on samples taken from the wrong context, and can now be settled at 2600-2400 cal BC. This means that the trilithons are contemporary with Durrington Walls, near neighbour and Britain\u0027s largest henge monument. These two monuments, different but complementary, now predate the earliest Beaker burials in Britain – including the famous Amesbury Archer and Boscombe Bowmen, but may already have been receiving Beaker pottery. All this contributes to a new vision of massive monumental development in a period of high European intellectual mobility….","bibo:AuthorList":["Parker Pearson, M","Cleal, R","Marshall, P","Needham, S P","Pollard, J","Richards, C","Ruggles, C","Sheridan, J A","Thomas, J","Tilley, C","Welham, K","Chamberlain, A","Chenery, C","Knüsel, C","Linford, N","Martin , L","Montgomery, J","Payne , A","Richards, M"],"dc:date":"2007-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Allen and A Bayliss.

The Waka had been held in the Museum stores for many years and due to its incompleteness and poor state of repair had not been on public display. It was proposed that the Waka be restored with the intention of it being a focal point of a new permanent gallery in the Royal Museum in Edinburgh dedicated to South Pacific cultures and communities. The gallery was being developed as one part of a £44 million redevelopment of Royal Museum building. Due to its poor condition assistance was sought to help in the restoration, reconstruction and visual interpretation of the Waka. NMS commissioned George Nuku, a Māori carver, to remake missing parts. Nuku uses a variety of mediums to carve including Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA). This made a clear distinction between new and original material that could be easily read by the public and reflected Nuku\u0027s conceptual vision of creating physical \"ghosts\" influenced by the original carvings. Due to the composite construction and condition of the canoe the project became more complex and involved. This paper describes how the renewal was done and the relationships that developed between artist, curator and conservator.","bibo:AuthorList":["Stable, Charles"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Gerrish.
