It recognises the potential value of National Occupational Standards as a means of promoting public esteem and recognition by other professionals, providing a framework for the discussing and enhancing practice and a means of maintaining quality and standards. However, the narrow instrumental emphasis on outcomes involves a lack of emphasis on the process of learning, marginalises professional values and ignores the context in which learning takes place. Consequently National Occupational Standards are only useful when used in conjunction with a broad-based education and training programme, which encourages creative practice and innovation and is aimed at producing fully-reflective and self-critical practitioners.","bibo:AuthorList":["Miller, Thoby"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.319021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.283247,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103052,"sim:weight":0.27845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2837,"sim:weight":0.278102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.274862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98696,"sim:weight":0.273507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383670,"sim:weight":0.271939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101275,"sim:weight":0.271617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.267508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.265278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.263167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101495,"sim:weight":0.260662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.25848,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.254845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":741,"sim:weight":0.254471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.243343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.241744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.239772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48298,"sim:weight":0.239602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.239346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The approach is based upon a risk reduction philosophy and is underpinned by cognitive behavioural principles.

This paper reports a study exploring district nurses\u0027 experiences of providing palliative care for patients with cancer and their families. Background. There is an increasing demand for palliative care in the community, as many patients wish to die at home. District nurses are central to providing palliative care in the community, but there is a dearth of literature on district nurses\u0027 experiences in palliative care. Method. A Husserlian phenomenological approach was adopted with a purposive sample of 25 female district nurses. Data were collected using unstructured, tape-recorded interviews and analysed using Colaizzi\u0027s seven stages of data analysis. Findings. Four themes were identified: the communication web; the family as an element of care; challenges for the district nurse in symptom management and the personal cost of caring.  Conclusions. District nurses\u0027 experiences of providing palliative care to family units was challenging but rewarding. The emotive nature of the experience cannot be under-estimated, as many district nurses were touched by the varying situations. Whilst acknowledging the need to maintain an integrated approach to care, district nurses should be identified as the key workers in the complex situation of palliative care.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dunne, K","Sullivan, K A","Kernohan, G"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2648.2005.03402.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":54968,"sim:weight":0.60568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.504492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53865,"sim:weight":0.464446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18839,"sim:weight":0.459313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59041,"sim:weight":0.430834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102645,"sim:weight":0.430161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382087,"sim:weight":0.409155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13059,"sim:weight":0.375572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43546,"sim:weight":0.362376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.359002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102942,"sim:weight":0.34905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17940,"sim:weight":0.336794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666108,"sim:weight":0.331774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77319,"sim:weight":0.3301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49252,"sim:weight":0.32824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.319863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58696,"sim:weight":0.319024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43935,"sim:weight":0.305278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59081,"sim:weight":0.300902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46504,"sim:weight":0.264704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Work to date suggests that students readily adapt to the on-line community and, given sufficient instruction, utilize the wiki pages to work together constructively. Evidence indicates that, provided tutors are supportive and provide encouragement, the level of wiki activity is independent of whether contributions are formally assessed or not, however, the language style adopted by students does change when their work is being assessed.

Findings - Narratives from both professionals and LFHWs indicated that the primary role for LFHWs was to encourage dietary change by translating complex messages into credible and culturally appropriate advice. Conclusions - The primary role of LFHWs in the 15 projects involved was to support existing NHS services to promote healthy eating amongst \u0027hard to reach\u0027 communities.

In this chapter, the contribution of politics to health studies is examined. The first part of the chapter considers how politics is defined and how this underpins the various strands of political science. It also examines some of the key concepts of political study: power, ideology, democracy, government and the state. It also explores what contribution politics has and can make to health studies. The second part considers some of the theoretical and methodological approaches within politics. It looks at political ideologies, how they offer competing definitions of politics, varied views of the social and political world, and divergent views on health and health improvement. A case study explores how recent changes in many contemporary societies, associated in particular with neo-liberal economic policies, have led to a greater emphasis on freedom through choice. Individuals are called upon to take a greater role in self-care and risk management in relation to their bodies. At the same time the development of large multi-national companies has given rise to a system of production whereby their size and dominance have provided them with an ability to structure the food market.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bambra, Clare","Smith, Katherine","Kennedy, Lynne"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":65637,"sim:weight":0.478879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81239,"sim:weight":0.358947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145598,"sim:weight":0.310064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145179,"sim:weight":0.30039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2881,"sim:weight":0.296509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":313654,"sim:weight":0.295012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45399,"sim:weight":0.294008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709549,"sim:weight":0.29332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":617729,"sim:weight":0.291059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710498,"sim:weight":0.289551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18124,"sim:weight":0.286975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44460,"sim:weight":0.27381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106931,"sim:weight":0.266597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98472,"sim:weight":0.263425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77455,"sim:weight":0.263224,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47127,"sim:weight":0.259963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633006,"sim:weight":0.256763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709929,"sim:weight":0.250714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43479,"sim:weight":0.248058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43716,"sim:weight":0.246966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This ethnomethodological study explored the practice of 10 mental health nurses working in an acute admissions unit. Through semi-structured interviews, the nurses were asked to discuss the taken-for-granted methods of empowerment with individual service users, their families and with work colleagues. The results were thematically analysed and compared with international findings, which reflected an awareness among mental health nurses of empowering practice in four areas. These were: Working with mental illness, Making connections, Responsibility and Teamworking.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lloyd, Marjorie"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2850.2007.01116.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":387374,"sim:weight":0.410508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382087,"sim:weight":0.360845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43546,"sim:weight":0.356302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1651882,"sim:weight":0.315712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.301461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78306,"sim:weight":0.27177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18196,"sim:weight":0.262251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.256649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59081,"sim:weight":0.256552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98709,"sim:weight":0.254164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43782,"sim:weight":0.241958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102665,"sim:weight":0.241562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.236381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.23514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.232721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75615,"sim:weight":0.222254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998639,"sim:weight":0.221228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46504,"sim:weight":0.219629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.213391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103114,"sim:weight":0.204284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The exhibition comprised assemblages’ prints, and installation by two UK artists John McClenaghen, Programme Leader for Fine Art at Glyndwr University and Alec Shepley, Head of School of Art and Design at the University of Lincoln. The exhibition forms a part of a much broader research project in which the two artists are investigating the presentation of the fragmented work and the ‘unfinished’ project. Aspects of dilapidation, ruin and entropy are explored and much of the work in this exhibition focuses on the notion of the ‘ruin in reverse’ - coming into being as opposed to being left to decay. The work resulting from the research project demonstrates a seemingly endless preoccupation with cutting, placing, re-cutting and re-placing, joining and un-joining, telescoping between making and un-making, and the eventual ‘dis-assembly’ or collapse of the outcome. The exhibition and the broader research project will be accompanied by a publication with foreword by artist and curator John Ploughman to be produced in collaboration with the National Academy of Art, Sofia. A joint lecture by both artists was held in the gallery to discuss the aspects of the work in more detail and provide a forum to debate the media, materials, processes and ideas involved and the contextual underpinning. As a result of this visit CIMPH at Glyndwr have been invited to take part in the DA international digital arts festival next year. We have also agreed to collaborate with the National Academy of Art, Sofia on Distance 3 which will be a research and exhibition project, pairing Bulgarian and UK based artists who share similar concerns initiating long Distance creative dialogue and resulting in an Oriel Wrecsam touring exhibition.

Study aims: This paper presents the findings of the second stage of a three-stage study, which evaluated the North Wales Breast Care Nursing Service. The aim of this stage was to evaluate the breast care nursing service from the perspective of District Nurses and Practice Nurses. Methodological issues: A postal questionnaire was distributed to the total population of District Nursing Sisters (n\u003d97) and Practice Nurses (n\u003d243) within North Wales. The questionnaire comprised both open and closed items as well as a 15-item Likert Scale. Findings/conclusion: The study demonstrated the value of the BCNS, as perceived by two other community nursing disciplines within North Wales. The service was considered to be responsive, accessible and to offer support and advice for patients. Community nurses who were familiar with the BCNS service, or had used the service, considered BCNSs to have excellent clinical skills, on which they could draw as a resource. Nurses who were less familiar with the service considered that it should be promoted more effectively to community nurses. It is concluded that District Nurses could have a vital role in the care of women with breast cancer, but need support, advice and training from the BCNS service to enable them to provide a complementary role. This could ultimately enable BCNS time could be used more effectively.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carnwell, R","Baker, Sally-Ann"],"dc:date":"2003-09-01","doi":"10.1016/j.cein.2003.08.002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58696,"sim:weight":0.593464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382087,"sim:weight":0.528961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99951,"sim:weight":0.526917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43546,"sim:weight":0.500826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101219,"sim:weight":0.49363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102645,"sim:weight":0.484452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54968,"sim:weight":0.458431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.453303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83748,"sim:weight":0.446348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104296,"sim:weight":0.418077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56711,"sim:weight":0.394108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.385143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48236,"sim:weight":0.361489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.335372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.331036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99033,"sim:weight":0.329949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.313314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.307257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48298,"sim:weight":0.305361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81539,"sim:weight":0.300958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Within different countries problems exist in educating and supervising students in clinical practice and various models of clinical education are employed. In Wales, United Kingdom, this responsibility is divided between mentors, lecturer practitioners and link tutors. This paper reports on the third phase of a three-phase study in Wales to explore differences between mentors, lecturer practitioners and link tutors, and how they work together to assist students to integrate theory and practice. Four focus group interviews of National Health Service managers and Higher Education managers (n\u003d22) were conducted. Qualitative content analysis revealed four themes: role characteristics and competencies, role differences, role conflict, and future options. The findings suggest a theory–practice continuum along which mentors, lecturer practitioners and link tutors occupy different positions. The article explores these different positions and offers suggestions for future role development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carnwell, R","Baker, Sally-Ann","Bellis, M","Murray, R"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","doi":"10.1016/j.nedt.2007.01.005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1666843,"sim:weight":0.365843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146096,"sim:weight":0.333231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99060,"sim:weight":0.309484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.292398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.282115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101854,"sim:weight":0.26063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104859,"sim:weight":0.238875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387299,"sim:weight":0.230983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81432,"sim:weight":0.22986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99186,"sim:weight":0.227249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709935,"sim:weight":0.206698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43546,"sim:weight":0.203536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57264,"sim:weight":0.201288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.196908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631103,"sim:weight":0.194968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102645,"sim:weight":0.194754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.187877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1651882,"sim:weight":0.185252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.184383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101284,"sim:weight":0.183937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

If it is accepted that narratives are a means for the individual to address and share these issues, what are the underlying processes that may effect the reflection of these issues to form a narrative. It is the intention here to question what may be one of the underpinning requirements of an individual to work within a narrative framework, the concept of self awareness, and in particular the ability to communicate this awareness to others. Carson (2001, p199) states that ‘all situations can be described in a number of ways which reflect not just an author’s values, but also, more crucially, an authors’ identity’. This paper will question whether there is a singular unified ‘self’, or as James (1892) maintains, the individual is a highly complex social entity and that we display ‘as many different selves as people we interact with’ The concept of self awareness will be explored through relevant historical and contemporary literature in order to attempt to discover who in essence is writing the stories recounted in a narrative.","bibo:AuthorList":["De Prez, Phil"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":104958,"sim:weight":0.423492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1513322,"sim:weight":0.39527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352163,"sim:weight":0.355846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710092,"sim:weight":0.341747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43663,"sim:weight":0.336727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.325679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351681,"sim:weight":0.308448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":72909,"sim:weight":0.302199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.301201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18193,"sim:weight":0.294073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269897,"sim:weight":0.2933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312612,"sim:weight":0.29164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101596,"sim:weight":0.291369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.288898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.283997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88603,"sim:weight":0.282838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.277211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.274954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44963,"sim:weight":0.268924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387062,"sim:weight":0.26283,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This period also marked a watershed for illicit drug use which had become so widespread across the UK that it was regarded as a mainstream adolescent experience. However, broadly speaking there were two groups of drug users: one group of young people who selectively used drugs on a recreational and largely non-problematic basis; while another group (usually unemployed and socially excluded), who used whatever drugs they could find in a chaotic and problematic manner. Drug taking had become a normalized activity and criminalization of these drugs seemed unenforceable, out of touch and inappropriate. Inheriting an unworkable 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act 1997 seemed an opportune time for the New Labour government to deliver on its ‘promise of change’ and introduce drug legislation fit for the new millennium. This article reflects upon some of the key policy and legal changes introduced by the New Labour government (1997—2010) to manage drug use and misuse.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buchanan, Julian"],"dc:date":"2010-01-01","doi":"10.1177/0264550510373809","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":10479,"sim:weight":0.386043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95764,"sim:weight":0.345856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107315,"sim:weight":0.327951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43534,"sim:weight":0.319683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99064,"sim:weight":0.275586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145923,"sim:weight":0.275058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.268393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929833,"sim:weight":0.261246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101251,"sim:weight":0.258851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77871,"sim:weight":0.251871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77455,"sim:weight":0.240265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107216,"sim:weight":0.213495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60707,"sim:weight":0.21045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382015,"sim:weight":0.207461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77016,"sim:weight":0.196329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43845,"sim:weight":0.196011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44978,"sim:weight":0.189292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43523,"sim:weight":0.188844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.185978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43649,"sim:weight":0.179725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The majority of the papers published on the microwave curing of reinforced epoxy resin composites have used widely available DGEBA type resins and amine hardeners such as 4,4’-diaminodiphenylsulphone (DDS). This paper investigates the use of two epoxy systems where the choice of resin and hardener was based on their measured dielectric loss factors. System 1 contained a resin and hardener with higher loss factors than those used in System 2. The two systems were formulated with polyetherimide (PEI) as a toughening agent. Unidirectional carbon fibre prepregs were prepared from both systems. Composites were laid up from these prepregs which were then cured in three different ways: autoclave curing, partial autoclave curing followed by microwave post-curing, and microwave curing. System 1 composites had greater flexural properties and interlaminar shear strengths than System 2 composites when autoclave cured. Flexural properties and interlaminar shear strengths were greater for System 2 in the microwave post-cured composites. When fully microwave cured the properties were similar. In the microwave cured composites the flexural and interlaminar shear properties were influenced by the structure of the phase separated PEI and the void content.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nightingale, C","Day, Richard"],"dc:date":"2002-04-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":871362,"sim:weight":0.587657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":871393,"sim:weight":0.374856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":756226,"sim:weight":0.372598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1051585,"sim:weight":0.371169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100688,"sim:weight":0.365429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":691303,"sim:weight":0.346266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98874,"sim:weight":0.342568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":765499,"sim:weight":0.29176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18164,"sim:weight":0.287806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1117514,"sim:weight":0.28576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":763783,"sim:weight":0.278538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386727,"sim:weight":0.272667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75609,"sim:weight":0.269288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17954,"sim:weight":0.265783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":827559,"sim:weight":0.256614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99295,"sim:weight":0.251573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98541,"sim:weight":0.245998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":968414,"sim:weight":0.243016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46341,"sim:weight":0.239296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101316,"sim:weight":0.234459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Experiments have been carried out using ASAR imagery from Envisat combined with nine bands of ASTER imagery from the NASA Terra satellite. An experimental test site in an agricultural area in the county of Lincolnshire, UK, has been used. The satellite imagery has been integrated using artificial neural networks which have been trained as predictors of the spatial distributions of yield per unit area in a variety of fields. Ground truth data in the form of yield maps from GPS-enabled combine harvesters have been used to train the neural networks and to evaluate accuracy. The results show that the combinations of ASTER and ASAR imagery can provide enhanced yield predictions with overall correlations of up to 0.77 between predicted and actual yield patterns. The results also show that the use of dual polarization radar data alone is not sufficient to give reasonable yield predictions even in a multi-temporal mode. It has also been shown that varying the architectures of the neural networks with ensembles can improve the overall results.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wilkinson, Graeme G","Davies, I.

It has been shown that protein-rich fractions of gum Arabic adsorb onto limonene oil droplets and that there is no significant molecular mass dependence. The amount adsorbed was determined from differences in the intensities of the gel permeation chromatography elution profiles of the gum before and after preparing emulsions and was found to be 6.5 and 5 mg/m2 at pH 3.5 and 7.5, respectively. These values are greater than might be expected for monolayer coverage. The amount of protein associated with the gum Arabic adsorbed was about 0.25 mg/m2, which corresponds to 26% of the total protein present in the gum. In comparison, the amount of egg white protein adsorbed was found to be 1.2 and  0.8 mg/m2, respectively, at pH 3.5 and 7.5, which are typical values for monolayer coverage. For gum Arabic−egg white protein mixtures (1:0.05 w/w corresponding to 1:1 on a molar basis) at pH 7.5, both species are negatively charged, and there is no interaction between them. On formation of emulsions, they compete with each other for surface sites, and egg white protein molecules are adsorbed preferentially, although not exclusively. At pH 3.5, the molecules have opposite charge and interact and at this ratio form soluble electrostatic complexes, which are adsorbed at the interface during emulsification. The droplet size of emulsions prepared with gum Arabic was significantly less than for egg white protein over the concentration range studied. Gum Arabic−egg white protein mixtures (1: 0.05 w/w) at pH 3.5 produced emulsions with a droplet size similar to gum Arabic alone, while those prepared at pH 7.5 produced emulsions with a significantly larger droplet size.","bibo:AuthorList":["Padala, S R","Williams, Peter A","Phillips, G O"],"dc:date":"2009-01-01","doi":"10.1021/jf803794n","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631673,"sim:weight":0.314648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387341,"sim:weight":0.308411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":823468,"sim:weight":0.305909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1134147,"sim:weight":0.256139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":759881,"sim:weight":0.250636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99447,"sim:weight":0.224808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386663,"sim:weight":0.223651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145983,"sim:weight":0.204569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1060564,"sim:weight":0.198028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99455,"sim:weight":0.176791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101368,"sim:weight":0.162454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99047,"sim:weight":0.157333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12394,"sim:weight":0.156837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47603,"sim:weight":0.152636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99465,"sim:weight":0.146108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47651,"sim:weight":0.140343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.140324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.139934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98877,"sim:weight":0.138029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99102,"sim:weight":0.133807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The article provides a brief outline of the current use of the Welsh Language in Wales and explores the significance of being a territorially bound and historically situated linguistic group. Perceptions of members of a youth offending team (from an area with a high proportion of Welsh speakers) are used to illustrate some key issues affecting Welsh speaking young people sentenced to custody. The developmental and rehabilitative implications of the current situation for young Welsh speaking people and the institutional responses to their linguistic needs are explored. Concluding the discussion, the authors argue that either the current Youth Justice Board for England and Wales needs to engage more proactively with the bilingual context of Wales, or a new Youth Justice Board for Wales should be constituted. Such a Board, they suggest, would be specifically concerned and focused on Welsh issues and might therefore be more committed towards making equal opportunities a reality for Welsh speaking young people in custody.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hughes, Caroline","Madoc-Jones, Iolo"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","doi":"10.1111/j.1468-2311.2005.00382.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":340553,"sim:weight":0.351349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98855,"sim:weight":0.318239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13149,"sim:weight":0.313208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.290112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1395231,"sim:weight":0.27753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82091,"sim:weight":0.277076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.26951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7960,"sim:weight":0.26476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45957,"sim:weight":0.213623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60707,"sim:weight":0.207082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76475,"sim:weight":0.205923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100354,"sim:weight":0.204524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47301,"sim:weight":0.204456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":28618,"sim:weight":0.203889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387386,"sim:weight":0.189967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9339993,"sim:weight":0.181447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47369,"sim:weight":0.173793,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2906,"sim:weight":0.167516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102723,"sim:weight":0.16112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382759,"sim:weight":0.158575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, a significant impact on data network performance has been shown in several papers. Congested Internet situations, where TCP/IP buffers start to fill, show long-range dependent (LRD) self-similar chaotic behaviour. The exponential growth of the number of servers, as well as the number of users, causes the performance of the Internet to be problematic since the LRD traffic has a significant impact on the buffer requirements. The Internet is a large-scale, wide-area network for which the importance of measurement and analysis of traffic is vital. The intensity of the long-range dependence (LRD) of communications network traffic can be measured using the Hurst parameter. A variety of techniques (such as R/S analysis, aggregated variance-time analysis, periodogram analysis, Whittle estimator, Higuchi\u0027s method, wavelet-based estimator, absolute moment method, etc.) exist for estimating Hurst exponent but the accuracy of the estimation is still a complicated and controversial issue. Earlier research (Rezaul et al., 2006) introduced a novel estimator called the Hurst exponent from the autocorrelation function (HEAF) and it was shown why lag 2 in HEAF (i.e. HEAF (2)) is considered when estimating LRD of network traffic. HEAF estimates H by a process which is simple, quick and reliable. In this research we extend these concepts by introducing a novel algorithm for controlling the long-range dependence of network traffic, named CoLoRaDe which is shown to reduce the LRD of packet sequences at the router buffer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mohammed Rezaul, Karim","Grout, Vic"],"dc:date":"2007-04-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8998720,"sim:weight":0.618155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998724,"sim:weight":0.589266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998721,"sim:weight":0.55201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1058241,"sim:weight":0.434094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":864292,"sim:weight":0.418182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":982194,"sim:weight":0.394709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":920162,"sim:weight":0.292934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":980425,"sim:weight":0.229058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":982191,"sim:weight":0.221943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101379,"sim:weight":0.213326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26733,"sim:weight":0.209002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103079,"sim:weight":0.20688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708264,"sim:weight":0.201974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102618,"sim:weight":0.201689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101224,"sim:weight":0.196642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43308,"sim:weight":0.195748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43550,"sim:weight":0.19355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":120725,"sim:weight":0.188157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":982204,"sim:weight":0.170631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43116,"sim:weight":0.166119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, little attention has been paid to the theoretical causal mechanisms by which health may be affected by prayer. A critical examination of extant literature on the psychology of prayer was conducted to identify potential ways in which prayer may act to promote health. The review suggested that an array of prayer types exist ranging from prayers of attunement to petitionary prayers. Additionally, prayer may affect health by a variety of means including: (a) prayer may improve health because of the placebo effect; (b) individuals who pray may also engage in health-related behaviour; (c) prayer may help by diverting attention from health problems; (d) prayer may promote health through supernatural intervention by God; (e) prayer may activate latent energies, such as chi, which have not been empirically verified, but which nevertheless may be beneficial to health; and (f) prayer may result in a unity of consciousness which facilitates the transmission of healing between individuals. An agreement among researchers about the classification and measurement of prayer might result in an easier comparison of results across studies. Researchers should be aware of the many prayer types documented in the literature and should select a measure of prayer appropriate to their field of investigation. Additionally, researchers should give consideration to the possible causal mechanisms underlying the hypotheses they are investigating. Furthermore, if researchers offer some theoretically based argument, regarding prayer, for the hypotheses that they are testing, then results from studies involving prayer may be more meaningful. Having established the theoretical models of the ways in which prayer may promote better health, the challenge for psychology is to provide empirical evidence to confirm or disconfirm the alternate hypotheses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Breslin, M J","Lewis, Christopher A"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","doi":"10.1080/13674670701491449","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45982,"sim:weight":0.767026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1131930,"sim:weight":0.408559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1350122,"sim:weight":0.202039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101389,"sim:weight":0.166786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48400,"sim:weight":0.156995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18196,"sim:weight":0.132558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26084,"sim:weight":0.125777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.111314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.111314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.111314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.111314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.111314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.111314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.111314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.111314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.108274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.105566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99226,"sim:weight":0.105497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22782,"sim:weight":0.103362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99070,"sim:weight":0.102827,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Also, the rapid development of technologies has widened the scope of network and Internet applications and, in turn, increased traffic. The self-similar nature of this data traffic may exhibit spikiness and burstiness on large scales with such behaviour being caused by strong dependence characteristics in data: that is, large values tend to come in clusters and clusters of clusters and so on. Several studies have shown that TCP, the dominant network (Internet) transport protocol, contributes to the propagation of self-similarity. Bursty traffic can affect the Quality of Service of all traffic on the network by introducing inconsistent latency. It is easier to manage the workloads under less bursty (i.e. smoother) conditions. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for traffic shaping, which can smooth out the traffic burstiness. We name it the Bursty Packet Traffic Shaper (BPTraSha). Experimental results show that this approach allows significant traffic control by smoothing the incoming traffic. BPTraSha can be implemented on the distribution router buffer so that the traffic\u0027s bursty nature can be modified before it is transmitted over the core network (Internet).","bibo:AuthorList":["Razaul, Karim Mohammed","Grout, Vic"],"dc:date":"2007-09-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":982194,"sim:weight":0.576199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998720,"sim:weight":0.425775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":920162,"sim:weight":0.375302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80882,"sim:weight":0.329627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1015558,"sim:weight":0.271033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1058127,"sim:weight":0.259961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998721,"sim:weight":0.246772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":982191,"sim:weight":0.224497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102618,"sim:weight":0.222807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101379,"sim:weight":0.205062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103079,"sim:weight":0.195513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1041455,"sim:weight":0.181026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102730,"sim:weight":0.1751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101224,"sim:weight":0.174366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":894197,"sim:weight":0.165749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26670,"sim:weight":0.165081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26733,"sim:weight":0.164904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43308,"sim:weight":0.161915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43116,"sim:weight":0.155978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":120725,"sim:weight":0.155664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In doing so, it is anticipated that their emotional literacy and social competence might be enhanced. Recognizing that an increasing number of children exhibit emotional and behavioural difficulties affecting their learning, Wrexham Local Education Authority implemented a Student Assistance Programme (SAP). SAP offers primary prevention and early intervention to pupils who exhibit high-risk behaviours and supports those whose circumstances affect their ability to engage with others at home and school, through participation in support groups. A study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of SAP. The study aimed to illuminate changes in student behaviour as described by themselves and facilitators, and to identify any wider implications of the SAP in terms of its effects on peers, teachers and family members. Using an interactive, responsive evaluation design, 11 focus group interviews were conducted involving 21 facilitators, seven head-teachers and 64 children. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The findings revealed benefits, challenges and issues of sustainability. This paper discusses the findings of the study and the implications for future sustainability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carnwell, R","Baker, Sally-Ann"],"dc:date":"2007-03-01","doi":"10.1111/j.1468-0122.2007.00398.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":386830,"sim:weight":0.381452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3222,"sim:weight":0.323546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23452,"sim:weight":0.298101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77943,"sim:weight":0.296194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385543,"sim:weight":0.29558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.29474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98717,"sim:weight":0.289882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106147,"sim:weight":0.289044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2823,"sim:weight":0.285528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.28343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46984,"sim:weight":0.281516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5127,"sim:weight":0.280008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83523,"sim:weight":0.277582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83254,"sim:weight":0.276078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99204,"sim:weight":0.273571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2851,"sim:weight":0.269875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23668,"sim:weight":0.269244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43875,"sim:weight":0.268605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.264764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10376,"sim:weight":0.262725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the complex nature of the solution behaviour of such compounds and the low magnetic field strengths then available often frustrated proper analysis of the data, and the first reported NMR studies were generally inconclusive. Worse, the interpretation of early NMR spectra was often based on preconceived (and as it is now realized incorrect) notions as to the nature of the compounds in solution, so caution must be exercised when considering much of the pre-1970’s data.\nAlthough the advent of higher field NMR instruments and our increasing understanding\nof the solution behaviour of organomagnesium reagents have greatly improved the veracity\nof NMR studies, detailed NMR reports on such compounds remain relatively sparse. The bulk of the literature that has been published was done so prior to the 1980’s. The reasons\nfor the paucity of reported NMR studies are probably three-fold: (i) organomagnesium\nreagents are generally highly sensitive, making the isolation of sufficiently pure samples\nproblematic; (ii) different preparations can apparently give quite different NMR spectra;\n(iii) the exact solution behaviour depends on a number of factors, making it difficult to\ndraw any general conclusions.\nThis paper reviews the current state of the literature on the NMR of Grignard and other organomagnesium compounds.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heard, Peter J"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","doi":"10.1002/9780470751879.ch3","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1352864,"sim:weight":0.408638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44827,"sim:weight":0.213237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2971,"sim:weight":0.19017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24487,"sim:weight":0.163544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43702,"sim:weight":0.155594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.155118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145741,"sim:weight":0.14715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.142851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.142851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.142851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.142851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.142851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.142851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.142851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.14141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.137067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43534,"sim:weight":0.132766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.13199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.130328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99204,"sim:weight":0.129462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Classic examples of such processes include the exchange of axial and equatorial environments in trigonal bipyramidal complexes, such as Fe(CO)₅, and the migration of the metal moiety round the periphery of the cyclopentadiene ring in η¹-bound Cp complexes. The systematic study of fluxional processes is of interest because it can not only help provide a detailed, quantitative ‘picture’ of the bonding between the metals and ligands involved, but it can also help to rationalise chemical reactivity patterns. The introduction of chirality into organometallic complexes, usually in the form of a non-racemic chiral ligand, has led to an explosion in the importance such species, particularly with regard to their applications in organic functional group transformations. The presence of a chiral centre can also provide an excellent spectroscopic handle on the complex in question, enabling both novel fluxional processes to be observed and new light to be shed on old (unresolved) problems.

Developed as a framework for translating the key principles of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (1986) into practice, it is best characterized as a process for successfully encouraging healthy public policy. In 2001, the German Healthy Cities Network (HCN) commissioned a survey of the 52 local Healthy Cities programme Coordinators (HCC) to monitor progress and identify strengths and weaknesses associated with its implementation. Most (90%; 47/52) HCC participated in the survey. Several positive aspects of the Health Cities Programmes (HCP) in Germany were identified: during the first 5 years, it expanded rapidly; project coordinators felt highly engaged, despite limited resources; a combination of traditional and innovative approaches was adopted and applauded; and almost 75% of HCC felt that their efforts had been beneficial. Nonetheless, the following shortcomings were identified: increased resources required; greater clarification of concepts and strategies at the local level; stronger commitment to the Nine-Point Programme of Action; greater integration within the national HCN and the local political administrative system (PAS); better programme documentation and evaluation. In conclusion, the HCN in Germany has expanded and developed since its inception 20 years ago. German HCP will only improve if professionalism and quality of local work are improved, particularly in terms of strengthening their influence on the local PAS and on public policies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Plumer, Klaus D","Kennedy, Lynne","Trojan, Alf"],"dc:date":"2010-04-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":10761,"sim:weight":0.275808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85579,"sim:weight":0.236589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.219063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15255,"sim:weight":0.21897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17879,"sim:weight":0.216448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43834,"sim:weight":0.21244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.190733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77815,"sim:weight":0.190445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.187882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.187882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.187882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.187882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.187882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.187882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.187882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.187882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.187882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.187882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.187882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.187882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Study aims: This paper presents the findings of the third stage of a three-stage project. The aim of this phase of the study was to evaluate the Breast Care Nursing Specialist (BCNS) service from the patients’ perspective. Methodological issues: A postal questionnaire was distributed to women with breast cancer who had experienced the BCNS service (n\u003d172). The questionnaire included a 4-point, 28-item Likert scale as well as open and closed questions. Findings/conclusion: The findings revealed positive perceptions of the value of the BCNS service, particularly in relation to support around the time of diagnosis. Areas requiring improvement included meeting information needs of women with breast cancer, availability of BCNSs, and providing emotional support to family members and to women in the longer term as well as providing practical care. It is concluded that increasing the numbers of BCNSs, and providing training in counselling as well as access to information and how this can be shared with women, would do much to address these deficits in service provision.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carnwell, R","Baker, Sally-Ann"],"dc:date":"2003-06-01","doi":"10.1016/S1361-9004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58696,"sim:weight":0.609462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23820,"sim:weight":0.54119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17869,"sim:weight":0.390293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77319,"sim:weight":0.373067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.31928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1342224,"sim:weight":0.318194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53865,"sim:weight":0.290847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43298,"sim:weight":0.274709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.2739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102645,"sim:weight":0.272422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.267689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80935,"sim:weight":0.264915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56059,"sim:weight":0.255967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99443,"sim:weight":0.252749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49252,"sim:weight":0.246879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102665,"sim:weight":0.24355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102632,"sim:weight":0.242729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.241329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.240345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81539,"sim:weight":0.238436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The findings indicated that the caregivers experienced similar transitions to the patients with regards to health-illness transition and organisational transitions. The caregivers adopted various roles in the day hospital such as Companion ‘being with’ their relative, Protector ‘keeping an eye’; Practical Caregiver and assuming an Advocate Role.

This study sought to explore the nurses\u0027 experience of a day hospital chemotherapy service in an acute general hospital in Northern Ireland and how this compared with their experience of working in an inpatient setting.\nBackground. Despite the many changes taking place in cancer care delivery, little research has been conducted on nurses\u0027 experience of working in more acute cancer treatment settings. Research conducted to date has tended to focus on the role of nurses in wards, hospices and palliative care settings.\nDesign. This Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenological study explored nurses\u0027 lived experience of day hospital chemotherapy service.\nMethod. Face-to-face focused in-depth interviews were conducted with the total population of nurses who worked in the day hospital at the time of data collection (n \u003d 10). Data analysis involved a two-staged approach, the analysis of narratives and narrative analysis, based on the work of Polkinghorne (1995).\nConclusions. The nurses\u0027 viewed their experience of the chemotherapy day hospital as having both positive and negative dimensions. The positive dimensions included an increased sense of autonomy and the challenge of developing new skills, while the negative dimension included a perceived decrease in their caring role:\n(i) The individual characteristics of the nurse were seen to have a key influence on caring experience;\n(ii) Role changes led to a perceived dichotomy between their actual and aspired role and their caring and clinical role.\nRelevance to clinical practice. There is a need to achieve a balance between delivering a clinical role (administering chemotherapy) while maintaining the centrality of the nurse–patient relationship. This can be likened to achieving a balance between \u0027nursing the clinic\u0027 alongside \u0027nursing the patient\u0027. These findings have implications for the discourse on caring within other outpatient type clinics and discourse on cancer nursing as therapy and the culture of the cancer clinic.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mcilfatrick, S","Sullivan, K A","McKenna, H"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01495.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1382087,"sim:weight":0.523229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43546,"sim:weight":0.508057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99062,"sim:weight":0.472083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382009,"sim:weight":0.454749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98952,"sim:weight":0.424148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17940,"sim:weight":0.421625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1651882,"sim:weight":0.410384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101268,"sim:weight":0.381707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59081,"sim:weight":0.365381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99433,"sim:weight":0.364457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.363924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54968,"sim:weight":0.36101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270258,"sim:weight":0.359533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.356543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43935,"sim:weight":0.353617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58696,"sim:weight":0.348043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46504,"sim:weight":0.341584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.334011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47203,"sim:weight":0.330225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.324575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Study design: A descriptive evaluation of programme development and field-testing (1995-1997) in the community. Non-experimental design. Setting: community, less affluent neighbourhoods in Bolton, North West England. Subjects: 1272 people in total, individuals and members of community groups, recorded as CNA contacts during 2 discreet monitoring periods; an opportunistic or purposive sampling strategy was used; subjects were randomly selected for group interview (n\u003d8) and telephone interviews (n\u003d41) out of a traceable sample of contacts (n\u003d94) over a randomly selected 1month collection period. Findings: compared with professional only service, CNAs efforts resulted in a fourfold increase in coverage of community nutrition services in the local community. CNAs demonstrated unique attributes, which positively influence their ability to work well with local people, but particularly those considered hard to reach. At least half the subjects interviewed reported positive behaviour changes such as changes to foods bought, cooking methods or foods eaten in the home.  Conclusions: This study has shown some benefits in training local people to work alongside existing community dietitians. This may help to reduce inequalities in health, address barriers to healthy eating experienced by low income families, and improve cost effectiveness.  Before expansion continues on an ad hoc basis further research is needed to test generalisability, to assess health outcomes, and to quantify the value of using local people. The findings here are useful in guiding further developments.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kennedy, Lynne","Ubido, J","Elhassan, S","Price, A","Sephton, J"],"dc:date":"1999-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2707836,"sim:weight":0.493497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.273578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1663875,"sim:weight":0.266985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95995,"sim:weight":0.26484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43687,"sim:weight":0.245622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83001,"sim:weight":0.240357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999416,"sim:weight":0.240015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":325339,"sim:weight":0.225548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102676,"sim:weight":0.21924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66882,"sim:weight":0.216562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18085,"sim:weight":0.214103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22729,"sim:weight":0.208997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1337275,"sim:weight":0.208205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709866,"sim:weight":0.199096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83480,"sim:weight":0.198635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666846,"sim:weight":0.197099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2708124,"sim:weight":0.196149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.192909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.192909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.192909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Reflection Holographic Optical Elements","bibo:abstract":"Silver halide sensitized gelatin (SHSG) holograms are similar to holograms recorded in dichromated gelatin (DCG), the main recording material for holographic optical elements (HOEs). The drawback of DCG is its low energetic sensitivity and limited spectral response. Silver halide materials can be processed in such a way that the final hologram will have properties like a DCG hologram. Recently this technique has become more interesting since the introduction of new ultra-fine-grain silver halide (AgHal) emulsions. In particular, high spatial-frequency fringes associated with HOEs of the reflection type are difficult to construct when SHSG processing methods are employed. Therefore an optimized processing technique for reflection HOEs recorded in the new AgHal materials is introduced. Diffraction efficiencies over 90% can be obtained repeatably for reflection diffraction gratings. Understanding the importance of a selective hardening process has made it possible to obtain results similar to conventional DCG processing. The main advantage of the SHSG process is that high-sensitivity recording can be performed with laser wavelengths anywhere within the visible spectrum. This simplifies the manufacturing of high-quality, large-format HOEs, also including high-quality display holograms of the reflection type in both monochrome and full color.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kim, J M","Choi, B S","Choi, Y S","Kim, J K","Bjelkhagen, H I","Phillips, N J"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","doi":"10.1364/AO.41.001522","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1393511,"sim:weight":0.259318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1353390,"sim:weight":0.23519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385766,"sim:weight":0.21572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387681,"sim:weight":0.192986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65894,"sim:weight":0.175613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393510,"sim:weight":0.165555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1057682,"sim:weight":0.16338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271226,"sim:weight":0.148401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26743,"sim:weight":0.13995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46104,"sim:weight":0.129966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44673,"sim:weight":0.129108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101302,"sim:weight":0.127057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98680,"sim:weight":0.124545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2081544,"sim:weight":0.122873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98706,"sim:weight":0.120112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98575,"sim:weight":0.118315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512823,"sim:weight":0.116277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106939,"sim:weight":0.111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54114,"sim:weight":0.110357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43385,"sim:weight":0.108729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The mechanical and physical properties of the produced carbon fibre/epoxy composites were compared to those manufactured by conventional resin transfer moulding. Mechanical testing showed similar values of flexural moduli and flexural strength for the two types of composites after normalisation of the corresponding data to a common fibre volume fraction. A 9% increase of the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) was observed for the microwave cured composites. This enhancement in ILSS is attributed to a lowering of resin viscosity in the initial stage of the curing process, which was also confirmed via scanning electron microscopy by means of improved fibre wetting and less fibre pull-out.

Over a six-week period the experimental group studied training tapes consisting of 5 sets of 5 tackles, in each case with an expert providing his interpretation of the correct decision. Each clip was filmed from the referee’s perspective and taken from real game situations in order to maintain high ecological validity in accordance with naturalistic decision-making theory. The lowest ranked referees on the national panel significantly improved their percentage of correct decisions, becoming 17.43% more accurate in their decisions at the posttest.

Self-similarity and heavy-tailedness are of great importance for network capacity planning purposes in which researchers are interested in developing analytical methods for analysing traffic characteristics. Designers of computing and telecommunication systems are increasingly interested in employing heavy-tailed distributions to generate workloads for use in simulation - although simulations employing such workloads may show unusual characteristics.  Congested Internet situations, where TCP/IP buffers start to fill, show long-range dependent (LRD) self-similar chaotic behaviour. Such chaotic behaviour has been found to be present in Internet traffic by many researchers. In this context, the \u0027Hurst exponent\u0027, H, is used as a measure of the degree of long-range dependence. Having a reliable estimator can yield a good insight into traffic behaviour and may eventually lead to improved traffic engineering.  In this paper, we describe some of the most useful mechanisms for estimating the tail index of Internet traffic, particularly for distributions having the power law observed in different contexts, and also the performance of the estimators for measuring the intensity of LRD traffic in terms of their accuracy and reliability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mohammed Rezaul, Karim","Grout, Vic"],"dc:date":"2007-10-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8998720,"sim:weight":0.541347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":982194,"sim:weight":0.50812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998721,"sim:weight":0.374349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998724,"sim:weight":0.361792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664532,"sim:weight":0.226237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103079,"sim:weight":0.18955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101224,"sim:weight":0.184596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68096,"sim:weight":0.181156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.180061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":980425,"sim:weight":0.173126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68143,"sim:weight":0.169701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.15961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.15961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.15961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.15961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.15961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.15961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.15961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.15961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.15961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For the first time, issues such as food poverty will be addressed by tackling the causes of poverty and wider determinants of ill health. The time has never been better, therefore, for health and local authorities to work collaboratively to promote and improve health. Community involvement is also paramount to sustainable programmes. However, such a dramatic shift in policy and greater emphasis on public health requires health professionals themselves to adopt a different approach.\nThe World Health Organisation recommends a health promotion approach as a framework for action. But despite the existence of this framework there is little evidence that a wider understanding of health promotion and the necessary practical experience has been achieved. This has weakened the potential impact of health promotion and has possibly encouraged inappropriate use of health promotion principles in practice.\nThis refers to a programme of work titled the European Food and Shopping Research Project (SUPER-project) during the period 1989-1997. SUPER was established under the WHO European network of Healthy Cities, to help local projects implement the principles of health promotion (WHO, 1986). This paper describes the SUPER -project and its implementation in Liverpool (1989-1997), where levels of unemployment, deprivation and ill health are amongst the highest in the UK. Participation in SUPER is appraised to identify the various benefits and obstacles involved and to identify links with progress at the local level. This appraisal is discussed and the use, and potential misuse, of participatory appraisal techniques to elicit information and mobilise communities is examined.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kennedy, Lynne"],"dc:date":"2001-03-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"D Acheson.

This study was initiated to enable carers to develop an information pack based upon their identified needs. Cooperative inquiry was the method used to ensure full participation of the carers. Group meetings were already in existence through a charity organization who provides a carers support network. The first author participated in a number of carers group meetings. Cooperative inquiry was used to clarify a number of themes identified and reflective cycles ensured that those themes remained relevant. It was found that carers did want to be involved in their relative\u0027s care, not as passive recipients but as collaborative care providers. To do this they need to be fully informed of the processes of care provision. Carers need information that is relevant, easily accessible and obtainable in varying degrees of comprehension. This study suggests that a culture shift within mental health nursing is necessary if professionals are to recognize that a perceived lack of support may lead to a breakdown in relationships between the carer, the person being cared for and the professionals.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lloyd, Marjorie"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2850.2004.00816.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1394526,"sim:weight":0.581366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271231,"sim:weight":0.514472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643980,"sim:weight":0.501246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.42757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998639,"sim:weight":0.268065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59462,"sim:weight":0.248484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":199795,"sim:weight":0.247808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931313,"sim:weight":0.242781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731320,"sim:weight":0.241859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107309,"sim:weight":0.237687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91226,"sim:weight":0.236737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.229144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46974,"sim:weight":0.227141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81539,"sim:weight":0.223796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2881,"sim:weight":0.222954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.217734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43687,"sim:weight":0.216694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59041,"sim:weight":0.216486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654320,"sim:weight":0.21569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.210709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In addition, type-D individuals reported performing significantly fewer health-related behaviors and lower levels of social support than non-type-D individuals. These relationships remained significant after controlling for neuroticism.\nConclusion\nThese findings provide new evidence on type-D and suggest a role for health-related behavior in explaining the link between type-D and poor clinical prognosis in cardiac patients.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, L","O\u0027Connor, R C","Howard, S","Hughes, B M","Johnston, D W","Hay, J L","O\u0027Connor, D B","Lewis, Christopher A","Ferguson, E","Sheehy, N","Grealy, M A","O\u0027Carroll, R E"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","doi":"10.1016/j.jpsychores.2007.06.008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2709866,"sim:weight":0.290494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66882,"sim:weight":0.274509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103121,"sim:weight":0.272711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102652,"sim:weight":0.252041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387053,"sim:weight":0.23735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47371,"sim:weight":0.235715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145905,"sim:weight":0.233692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100549,"sim:weight":0.229572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49164,"sim:weight":0.224084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19145,"sim:weight":0.20764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46641,"sim:weight":0.203098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710227,"sim:weight":0.185468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102619,"sim:weight":0.185005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91804,"sim:weight":0.183505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643622,"sim:weight":0.183404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145696,"sim:weight":0.182529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24368,"sim:weight":0.170293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101342,"sim:weight":0.169879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.160838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47124,"sim:weight":0.160072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Rheology experiments were used to confirm the microstructure and flow behavior of the system in the vicinity of the liquid−soft gel boundary previously located, as well as to identify a new liquid−hard gel transition at low temperatures. The dimensions of the micelles in the liquid phase were obtained from the micellar form factor described by a core/shell model. The parameters extracted from the modeling were in good agreement with previous results for the same system from light scattering. The micellar radius was found to decrease with temperature in the liquid phase, as a consequence of the contraction of the corona chains, caused by a decrease in solvent quality for poly(oxyethylene) at high temperature. The shape of the corona as a whole was preserved on increasing temperature, only undergoing a reduction in width. The equilibrium phase is fluid at volume fractions lower than the volume fraction for freezing of hard spheres, φf \u003d 0.494, in good agreement with a system of hard spheres. In the hard gel, the micelles are arranged in a bcc structure, as expected for micelles with lengthy E blocks.","bibo:AuthorList":["Catelletto, V","Hamley, I W","English, Rob J","Mingvanish, W"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","doi":"10.1021/la026917o","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":55312,"sim:weight":0.253413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":267032,"sim:weight":0.248056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1147519,"sim:weight":0.23731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146077,"sim:weight":0.235543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631798,"sim:weight":0.228679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360281,"sim:weight":0.203799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145940,"sim:weight":0.195893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97389,"sim:weight":0.194928,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99449,"sim:weight":0.193845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99501,"sim:weight":0.179648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23279,"sim:weight":0.176407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664562,"sim:weight":0.172986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.169701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18038,"sim:weight":0.165364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99447,"sim:weight":0.163531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1115219,"sim:weight":0.162518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23286,"sim:weight":0.161276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45112,"sim:weight":0.161096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391796,"sim:weight":0.14937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77295,"sim:weight":0.147853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of hyaluronan on proximal tubular cell migration.\nMethods The proximal tubular cell line, HK-2 cells, were grown in monolayer culture, and cell migration following addition of hyaluronan characterized in an in vitro model of injury that we have previously developed and characterized.\nResults Addition of well-defined preparations of exogenous hyaluronan increased cell migration; however, optimum enhancement of migration was seen with hyaluronan of high molecular weight. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, as assessed by increased expression of the dually phosphorylated active form of MAPK, could be demonstrated following addition of hyaluronan. This was blocked by the addition of a specific antibody to the hyaluronan receptor, CD44. Hyaluronan-dependent enhanced migration was also abrogated by addition the CD44 blocking antibody, and by inhibition of MAPK kinase (MEK) activity. Generation of a denuded area also led to increased synthesis of endogenous hyaluronan and activation of MAPK, and blockage of either CD44 or MAPK activation inhibited proximal tubule cell (PTC) migration and re-epithelialization under nonstimulated conditions.\nConclusion We have demonstrated that hyaluronan activation of the MAPK pathway through binding to its receptor CD44, enhances proximal tubule cell (PTC) migration. In addition, the results suggest that mechanical injury of PTC stimulated hyaluronan generation. These observations may have implications for both recovery from acute tubular injury and progressive renal fibrosis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ito, T","Williams, J D","Al-Assaf, S","Phillips, G O","Phillips, A O"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","doi":"10.1111/j.1523-1755.2004.00457.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":922695,"sim:weight":0.316648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":895645,"sim:weight":0.14567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383683,"sim:weight":0.140213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1364283,"sim:weight":0.118885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631880,"sim:weight":0.115792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929840,"sim:weight":0.114691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929900,"sim:weight":0.109988,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98887,"sim:weight":0.109721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49079,"sim:weight":0.106242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99141,"sim:weight":0.104377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75685,"sim:weight":0.104238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26477,"sim:weight":0.101238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76657,"sim:weight":0.0960097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57870,"sim:weight":0.093989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98707,"sim:weight":0.0899877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76961,"sim:weight":0.0895173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98860,"sim:weight":0.0877599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146196,"sim:weight":0.0875838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99258,"sim:weight":0.0866141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76969,"sim:weight":0.0859958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Their weight-average molecular mass was found to be 66000. A commercial sample of a PEG comb polymer with an acrylic backbone was also used in the studies (Sokalan HP 80). The interaction of the MAA/PEG comb polymers and pure sodium methacrylate (SPMA) with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was studied by ESR spectroscopy using 5-doxyl stearic acid (5-DSA) spin probe and by conductivity measurements. Surfactant aggregation in water occurred at SDS concentrations lower than the surfactant critical micelle concentration (cmc) and depended on the polymer concentration. The observations have been attributed to changes in the effective ionic strength of the systems due to the polymer itself, and it has been concluded that there is no interaction between the MAA/PEG comb copolymers or SPMA and SDS. This has been confirmed by the fact that the decrease in surfactant aggregation concentration is similar in magnitude to the decrease observed on adding NaCl when counterion ion condensation effects are taken into account. It is apparent that the electrostatic repulsions between the surfactant molecules and the methacrylate backbone of the MAA/PEG comb copolymers inhibit association of SDS with the PEG side chains.","bibo:AuthorList":["Middleton, H","English, Rob J","Williams, Peter A"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","doi":"10.1021/la040133o","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":17921,"sim:weight":0.266952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81375,"sim:weight":0.215376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102243,"sim:weight":0.203995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102622,"sim:weight":0.19036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46535,"sim:weight":0.190076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44222,"sim:weight":0.185151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385531,"sim:weight":0.181021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98645,"sim:weight":0.179702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98789,"sim:weight":0.157982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":645464,"sim:weight":0.154726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397046,"sim:weight":0.152358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47651,"sim:weight":0.149549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383930,"sim:weight":0.14875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101462,"sim:weight":0.142447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105106,"sim:weight":0.140046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77025,"sim:weight":0.134216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46911,"sim:weight":0.134121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43648,"sim:weight":0.131302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98706,"sim:weight":0.126671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1126808,"sim:weight":0.124739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The amount of amylose present was determined spectrophotometrically and found to be very similar ( 19%) for both starches. Scanning electron microscopy showed very small indented and spherical granules from both with an average granule size of 4.84 μm and 4.72 μm, respectively. The physicochemical properties, namely the swelling power, solubility, pasting characteristics, paste clarity and freeze–thaw stability were studied to assess the functionality of the starch pastes as hydrocolloids. The sweetsop starch showed higher swelling power and solubility compared to soursop starch and had a lower gelatinization temperature indicating a weaker granular structure. Sweetsop starch exhibited a lower pasting temperature, higher viscosity peak, higher viscosity breakdown and lower setback, higher paste clarity and freeze–thaw stability compared to soursop starch. The low gelatinization temperature and high freeze thaw stability of sweetsop starch are comparable to that of waxy corn. The properties of sweetsop indicate that it has potential for application as a thickener in frozen foods.","bibo:AuthorList":["Nwokocha, L M","Williams, Peter A"],"dc:date":"2009-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":891025,"sim:weight":0.57197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":631001,"sim:weight":0.55179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":661432,"sim:weight":0.465727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":598062,"sim:weight":0.456474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":777279,"sim:weight":0.424025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":748975,"sim:weight":0.40913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":758232,"sim:weight":0.408491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99464,"sim:weight":0.374717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99449,"sim:weight":0.36632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":821977,"sim:weight":0.351326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1028040,"sim:weight":0.330059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99452,"sim:weight":0.264207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102968,"sim:weight":0.215046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387329,"sim:weight":0.207084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":967808,"sim:weight":0.204722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":597518,"sim:weight":0.191288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":821966,"sim:weight":0.189717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99447,"sim:weight":0.158302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1143538,"sim:weight":0.158181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":834877,"sim:weight":0.149921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Elderly people could clearly benefit from this concept. Thanks to smart environments, they can experience considerable enhancements, giving them an opportunity to live more independently and for longer in their home rather than in a health-care centre. However, to implement such a system, it is essential to know for whom we are designing. In this paper, we present an intelligent system with a monitoring infrastructure that will help mainly elderly users with impairments to overcome their handicap. The purpose of such a system is to create a safe and intuitive environment that will facilitate the achievement of household tasks in order to preserve independence of elderly residents for a while longer. Pursuing this goal, we propose to use the persona concept to help us build a user model based on the personas’ aptitudes. The practice of user modelling emphasizes the importance of user-centred techniques in any AmI system development and highlights the potential impacts of AmI for certain targeted groups - in this case, the elderly and people with disabilities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Casas, Roberto","Blasco Marin, R","Robinet, Alexia","Roy Delgado, Armanda","Roy Yarza, Armanda","McGinn, John","Picking, Rich","Grout, Vic"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Roy Delgado, A Robinet, A McGinn, J Grout, V Picking and R.

Differences between the positions of the ν(C−O) IR bands of the CO ligands in Mn(Cp)(CO)₂(CO₂) and Re(Cp)(CO)₂(CO₂) suggest that the CO₂ ligand has different coordination modes to the metal centers in these complexes.  The kinetic data and the IR spectra of the CO₂, Xe, and heptane complexes provided evidence that the CO₂ coordination mode is η¹-O end-on bound in Mn(Cp)(CO)₂(CO₂), and η²-C,O side-on bound in Re(Cp)(CO)₂(CO₂).  These different coordination modes lead to dramatic differences in reactivity with CO, H₂, and N₂, with the Re complexes being significantly less reactive.  To provide more evidence for the nature of the CO₂ binding modes, a series of DFT calculations were performed at the B3LYP/SDD-6-311G** level.

An extension to this permits conduction currents to cross the boundary between the different computational domains. Several validation cases are examined and the results compared with available data.

{"identifier":388532,"ep:Repository":49,"dc:type":["text"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Computation of Electromagnetic Fields in Assemblages of Biological Cells Using a Modified Finite-Difference Time-Domain Scheme","bibo:abstract":"When modeling objects that are small compared with the wavelength, e.g., biological cells at radio frequencies, the standard finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method requires extremely small time-step sizes, which may lead to excessive computation times. The problem can be overcome by implementing a quasi-static approximate version of FDTD based on transferring the working frequency to a higher frequency and scaling back to the frequency of interest after the field has been computed. An approach to modeling and analysis of biological cells, incorporating a generic lumped-element membrane model, is presented here. Since the external medium of the biological cell is lossy material, a modified Berenger absorbing boundary condition is used to truncate the computation grid. Linear assemblages of cells are investigated and then Floquet periodic boundary conditions are imposed to imitate the effect of periodic replication of the assemblages. Thus, the analysis of a large structure of cells is made more computationally efficient than the modeling of the entire structure. The total fields of the simulated structures are shown to give reasonable and stable results at 900,1800, and 2450 MHz.

However, controversy remains over the possibility of adverse health effects from exposure to low level fields such as those associated with the use of mobile phones. A plausible mechanism considers the demodulation of amplitude modulated RF fields by biological systems: if this were to operate, they would be exposed to low frequency fields similar to those of biological processes, and therefore with the potential for biological activity.\nThis study performed the experiment originally proposed by Balzano [2002] to test whether biological cells exhibit the nonlinear responses necessary for demodulation. This would be indicated by the generation of a second-harmonic signal upon exposure of the sample to a pure fundamental signal at around 883 MHz. The experiment used a highly sensitive system employing a doubly-resonant cavity. Storage of the high-frequency energy in the highly-resonant cavity with very low noise amplification and the avoidance of any electrode contact with the samples allowed the experiments to approach the ultimate limits of physical sensitivity.\nUsing a wide range of biological materials, the study was not able to demonstrate non-linear conversion of RF energy by biological materials. The results do not support the hypothesis that living cells possess the non-linear properties necessary to rectify or demodulate RF energy. Therefore biological systems do not appear to act as effective radio receivers, at frequencies above a few hundred MHz.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kowalczuk, Christine","Yarwood, Gemma","Blackwell, Roger","Priestner, Marisa","Sienkiewicz, Zenon","Bouffler, Simon","Ahmed, Iftekhar","Abd-Alhameed, Raed","Excell, Peter S","Hodzic, Vildana","Davis, Christopher","Gammon, Robert","Balzano, Quirino"],"dc:date":"2010-01-01","doi":"10.1002/bem.20597","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":87415,"sim:weight":0.369808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81367,"sim:weight":0.271197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710695,"sim:weight":0.255993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98797,"sim:weight":0.233874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46977,"sim:weight":0.21022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1925702,"sim:weight":0.208604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101193,"sim:weight":0.206693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24051,"sim:weight":0.197654,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661446,"sim:weight":0.19216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709966,"sim:weight":0.190946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387384,"sim:weight":0.190104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145893,"sim:weight":0.186488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98575,"sim:weight":0.177871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43595,"sim:weight":0.177289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98708,"sim:weight":0.176198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113808,"sim:weight":0.176018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99445,"sim:weight":0.175405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45642,"sim:weight":0.174387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102610,"sim:weight":0.168347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930975,"sim:weight":0.165209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper presents a study of QoS models from a physical and data link layer point of view, more specifically, we introduce the Finite State Markov Chain (FSMC) model for fading channels at the physical layer and the Effective Capacity (EC) model at the data link layer. The FSMC can provide us with a quick estimate of current channel conditions like BER, while it is very hard using the physical channel model to get parameters like delay which needs an analysis of queueing behaviors; for that reason, a link-layer model – EC which provides a statistical QoS model on the unacceptable delay performance (i.e., the probability of delay exceeds a bound) is then studied.

This approach is based on the off-line pre-processing of lists to enable them to be reordered dynamically based on the type of traffic being processed by the router.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, John N","Grout, Vic","Picking, Rich"],"dc:date":"2010-07-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":918981,"sim:weight":0.315809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":707122,"sim:weight":0.272372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1075505,"sim:weight":0.253104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":747111,"sim:weight":0.245209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1059974,"sim:weight":0.23707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1082633,"sim:weight":0.232609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":960617,"sim:weight":0.218431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":793755,"sim:weight":0.21356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101379,"sim:weight":0.208576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":708384,"sim:weight":0.20646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":918986,"sim:weight":0.206026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998728,"sim:weight":0.206011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88894,"sim:weight":0.198437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":990908,"sim:weight":0.194238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102734,"sim:weight":0.18333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43550,"sim:weight":0.181449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46649,"sim:weight":0.180912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998725,"sim:weight":0.178339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998240,"sim:weight":0.177262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102730,"sim:weight":0.176461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the observation that skin patterning tends to be disrupted by malignant but not by benign skin lesions suggests that measurements of skin pattern disruption on simply captured white light optical skin images could be a useful contribution to a diagnostic feature set. Previous work using both skin line direction and intensity for lesion classification was encouraging. But these features have not been combined with the ABCD features. This paper explores the possibility of combing features from skin pattern and ABCD analysis to enhance classification performance.\nMethods: The skin line direction and intensity were extracted from a local tensor matrix of skin pattern. Meanwhile, ABCD analysis was conducted to generate six features. They were asymmetry, border irregularity, colour (red, green and blue) variegations and diameter of lesion. The eight features of each case were combined using a principal component analysis (PCA) to produce two dominant features for lesion classification.\nResults: A larger set of images containing malignant melanoma (MM) and benign naevi were processed as above and the scatter plot in a two-dimensional dominant feature space showed excellent separation of benign and malignant lesions. An ROC (receiver operating characteristic) plot enclosed an area of 0.94.\nConclusions: The classification results showed that the individual features have a limited discrimination capability and the combined features were promising to distinguish MM from benign lesion.","bibo:AuthorList":["She, Zhishun","Liu, Y","Damatoa, A"],"dc:date":"2007-02-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":23600,"sim:weight":0.196864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46378,"sim:weight":0.189414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98644,"sim:weight":0.185995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24346,"sim:weight":0.178015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929895,"sim:weight":0.177483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18057,"sim:weight":0.168679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60726,"sim:weight":0.164373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933744,"sim:weight":0.163632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387892,"sim:weight":0.157994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102706,"sim:weight":0.141223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710600,"sim:weight":0.141061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45314,"sim:weight":0.140444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52286,"sim:weight":0.139398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664608,"sim:weight":0.137344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930892,"sim:weight":0.137088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26629,"sim:weight":0.136669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52385,"sim:weight":0.133768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43385,"sim:weight":0.133345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44224,"sim:weight":0.132416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52294,"sim:weight":0.131833,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Because of the many home network concepts in this field, it is potentially viable to include several different network technologies in a home automation system; if these technologies are optimally combined then it is presumable to accomplish better results in performance, affordability and stability. For this reason, it is recommended to use each of them for the use of specific services that fit more accurately with their characteristics and capabilities. Nonetheless, besides the diversity of such environments, they all share a common subject: a need for remote control.  Actual trends in Domotics are closely oriented to the foremost elements associated with ubiquitous control, which is a significant topic due to the important advantages of having the possibility to manage home services from anywhere at any time. This paper describes a model for a secure, scalable and reliable remote-controlled home automation system; the role of this model is to provide users with a backup gateway to be able to control the services at home (or other buildings) in case of a failure of the main access. The development is focused on a proper handling of the underlying technologies, invisible to the user, to enable the backup gateway agents communicate with both the external agents and the home network agents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roy Delgado, Armando","Grout, Vic","Picking, Rich"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1082633,"sim:weight":0.294941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.263915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.245482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.237245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930696,"sim:weight":0.232546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934804,"sim:weight":0.229934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.213887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.213887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.213887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.213887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.213887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.213887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.213887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.213887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.213887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.213887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.213887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.213887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.213887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.213887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A simple model is formulated and then adapted to reduce the number of variables and constraints. Network reliability issues are then considered and a more complex model introduced. Finally the model is solved using a commercial solver to generate test instances with which to test the accuracy of a simulated annealing (SA) heuristic.

The Easy Line + project is primarily oriented to monitor and control white goods and to assist in emergency situations though it is deployed all over the home environment and can be extended, more easily thanks to the multi-agent approach, to control and monitor other devices or services at home.","bibo:AuthorList":["Roy Delgardo, Armando","Blasco, Ruben","Marco, Alvaro","Cirujano, Diego","Casas, Roberto","Roy Yarza, Armando","Grout, Vic","Picking, Rich"],"dc:date":"2010-04-01","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-12433-4_19","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":966717,"sim:weight":0.471762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90015,"sim:weight":0.437005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":757798,"sim:weight":0.353933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934804,"sim:weight":0.289576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2707924,"sim:weight":0.277024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931029,"sim:weight":0.26716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77388,"sim:weight":0.250572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.247454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102604,"sim:weight":0.239617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934626,"sim:weight":0.237272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.232044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103167,"sim:weight":0.219012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.210276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.210276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.210276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.210276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.210276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.210276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.210276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.210276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Several probability distributions, such as Pareto (simple), extreme value, Weibull (three parameters), exponential, logistic and Pareto (generalized) have been chosen to fit the experimental traffic data (traces), which show an analytical indication of traffic behaviour. The issues of traffic characterisation and performance shown by these models are discussed in terms of the heavy tailedness and fitness of the curves.

Although such an approach leads to variable processing times for each packet matched against the ACL, it also offers the opportunity to reduce this time by reordering its rules in response to changing traffic characteristics. A number of heuristics exist for optimising rule order in sequentially processed ACLs and the most efficient of these can be shown to have a beneficial effect in a majority of cases and for ACLs with relatively small numbers of rules. This paper presents an enhancement to this algorithm by reducing part of its complexity. Although the simplification involved leads to an instantaneous lack of accuracy, the long-term trade-off between processing speed and performance can be seen, through experimentation, to be positive. This improvement, though small, is consistent and worthwhile and can be observed in the majority of cases.","bibo:AuthorList":["Grout, Vic","Davies, John N"],"dc:date":"2010-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1145717,"sim:weight":0.177331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102618,"sim:weight":0.175354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998433,"sim:weight":0.170598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43308,"sim:weight":0.162688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145594,"sim:weight":0.160463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.160013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.160013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.160013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.160013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.160013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.160013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.160013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.160013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.160013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.160013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.160013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.160013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.160013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.160013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48414,"sim:weight":0.156913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Cramer Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the estimated complex vector corresponding to translational motion and the CRLB of the estimated distance between two scatterers are derived.

Computer music and digital audio are being advanced through investigations into emotion, content analysis, and context, and this chapter attempts to highlight the value of considering the information content present in sound, the context of the user being exposed to the sound, and the emotional reactions and interactions that are possible between the user and game sound. We demonstrate that by analysing the information present within media and considering the applications and purpose of a particular type of information, developers can improve user experiences and reduce overheads while creating more suitable, efficient applications. Some illustrated examples of our research projects that employ these theories are provided. Although the examples of research and development applications are not always examples from computer game sound, they can be related back to computer games. We aim to stimulate the reader’s imagination and thought in these areas, rather than attempt to drive the reader down one particular path.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cunningham, Stuart","Grout, Vic","Picking, Rich"],"dc:date":"2010-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101301,"sim:weight":0.403581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43193,"sim:weight":0.362606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44235,"sim:weight":0.356903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387347,"sim:weight":0.297829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634700,"sim:weight":0.284623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929825,"sim:weight":0.263545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59326,"sim:weight":0.248604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99149,"sim:weight":0.247307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.24474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83262,"sim:weight":0.242166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.223867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48375,"sim:weight":0.222365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145892,"sim:weight":0.220678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98893,"sim:weight":0.218462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269956,"sim:weight":0.209746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512108,"sim:weight":0.209746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387404,"sim:weight":0.205437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99250,"sim:weight":0.204947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382864,"sim:weight":0.203958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.202505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The home is an eternal, heterogeneous, distributed computing environment, which certainly requires a careful study before developing any suitable Home Automation System (HAS) that will accomplish its requirements. Nevertheless the latest attempts at introducing Home Automation Systems in actual homes for all kinds of users are starting to be successful thanks to the continuous standardization process that is lowering the prices and making devices more useful and easier to use for the end user. Even so several important issues are always to be handled strictly before developing and installing a Home Automation System; factors like security, reliability, usefulness, robustness and price are critical to determine if the final product will accomplish the expected requirements.","bibo:AuthorList":["Delgado, Armando Roy","Picking, Rich","Grout, Vic"],"dc:date":"2006-07-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98994,"sim:weight":0.275909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.221336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.217608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2707696,"sim:weight":0.208783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934095,"sim:weight":0.192066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1615779,"sim:weight":0.189917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666302,"sim:weight":0.186469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664656,"sim:weight":0.185305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664530,"sim:weight":0.180741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.17538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.17538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.17538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.17538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.17538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.17538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.17538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.17538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.17538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.17538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.17538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

To determine whether children\nwith weight problems were more likely to be found in some wards rather than others, and to compare the distribution for boys and girls.\nDesign: Retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study.\nSetting: One hundred and six primary schools from all parts of Liverpool city.\nSubjects: Five cohorts of 9–10-year-old children between 1998 and 2003.\nMain outcome measures: Body mass index (BMI) for each child to estimate proportions overweight, obese and overweight or obese according to international criteria.\nResults: Between January 1998 and March 2003, the heights and weights of 7902 boys and 7514 girls were measured and BMI calculated. The prevalence of boys and girls categorised as overweight or obese was very high (1620, 20.6% and 1909, 25.7%,\nrespectively). Prevalence was not related to deprivation and varied between wards only for the girls; some wards had very different prevalence rates for boys and girls (Picton: 59 boys, 23.4%; 106 girls, 36.6%). The most deprived ward did not have a\nremarkable prevalence of overweight or obesity (Speke: 32 boys, 15.3%; 40 girls, 19.8%).\nConclusions: Obesity is a major problem and requires urgent action but targeting intervention on the basis of administrative areas may be very wasteful. Different factors seem to lead to obesity in boys and girls, and attention should be paid to the\nrole of the physical environment.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dummer, T J","Gibbon, M A","Hackett, A F","Taylor, Sue R"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":870863,"sim:weight":0.514903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43840,"sim:weight":0.489681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145845,"sim:weight":0.488455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43962,"sim:weight":0.486636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929822,"sim:weight":0.458375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145929,"sim:weight":0.420243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19011,"sim:weight":0.414074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43848,"sim:weight":0.411852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65500,"sim:weight":0.402058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1033001,"sim:weight":0.382308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26489,"sim:weight":0.373393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18046,"sim:weight":0.350722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43619,"sim:weight":0.345929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83630,"sim:weight":0.321543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44016,"sim:weight":0.319811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.315986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43964,"sim:weight":0.313964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59916,"sim:weight":0.30621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1337275,"sim:weight":0.270569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23524,"sim:weight":0.240338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While the SBP sample itself was found to contain 2.67 and 1.06% protein and ferulic acid, respectively, the adsorbed fraction contained 11.10% protein and 2.16% ferulic acid. The adsorbed fraction was also found to have a higher degree of acetylation, notably at the C2 position on the galacturonic acid residues, and was also found to contain a higher proportion of neutral sugars, which are present in the ramified side chains of the pectin molecules. The thickness of the layer of SBP adsorbed onto polystyrene latex particles was studied by dynamic light scattering and was found to increase with increasing surface coverage. It was found to have a value of 140 nm at plateau coverage, which closely corresponded to the hydrodynamic diameter of the pectin chains. The adsorbed layer thickness was found to be sensitive to pH and the presence of electrolyte. The thickness at a surface coverage of 20 mg/m2 in the absence of electrolyte at pH 4 was 107 nm and at pH 8.8 was 70 nm, while at pH 4 in the presence of 10 mM NaCl the thickness was found to be 70 nm. It was concluded that the SBP molecules form multilayers at the surface due to electrostatic interaction between the positively charged protein moieties and the galacturonic acid residues. The removal of calcium from the SBP had no effect on the adsorbed layer thickness; hence, multilayer formation due to calcium ion cross-linking was considered unlikely.","bibo:AuthorList":["Siew, C K","Williams, Peter A","Cui, S W","Wang, Q"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","doi":"10.1021/jf801588a","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1653844,"sim:weight":0.417663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98837,"sim:weight":0.198539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12394,"sim:weight":0.187423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.184919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145983,"sim:weight":0.183965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386663,"sim:weight":0.167059,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75677,"sim:weight":0.166192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46779,"sim:weight":0.16441,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145800,"sim:weight":0.162933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43281,"sim:weight":0.162161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.161971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387366,"sim:weight":0.160926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.159123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.157915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43560,"sim:weight":0.156556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387341,"sim:weight":0.156063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101264,"sim:weight":0.155519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385666,"sim:weight":0.15305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26063,"sim:weight":0.151851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99102,"sim:weight":0.151606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The adsorbed layer thickness, δ, was determined from ζ potential measurements. δ was found to increase with increasing surface coverage but was significantly less than the polymer radius of gyration even at the adsorption plateau, indicating that the polymer coils flattened at the surface. BSA did not adsorb onto silica from water at pH 7 because of electrostatic repulsions, but adsorption did occur in the presence of electrolyte. The amount of BSA adsorbed at plateau coverage increased from 0.1 mg/m2 in 0.001 M NaCl to 1.0 mg/m2 in 0.5 M NaCl. BSA adsorption was significantly inhibited but not completely prevented, by precoating the silica particles with PVP. Even at low PVP surface coverages, where δ had very low values, some inhibition occurred.

The binding of Ca2+ ions has also been included for the latter for comparison. The binding curves showed an initial steep rise at low additions of Mn2+ or Ca2+ indicating that all of the ions were bound to the polymer chains with none remaining in solution. At higher additions, the binding curves showed a plateau region and the maximum amount bound, θ, was found to be 0.2, 0.2, 0.25, and 0.33 mol M2+/mol COO- for high M:G alginate, low M:G alginate, pectin, and PAA, respectively. The binding curves for Mn2+ and Ca2+ with PAA were superimposable. In all cases, θ was less than the stoichiometric equivalent and also less than predicted by Manning counterion condensation theory. The linear charge density, ξ, for the polymers is 1.49, 1.55, 1.62, and 2.85, and it was found that at maximum binding the effective linear charge density, ξeffective, decreased to a value close to 1 in each case and not 0.5 as predicted from Manning\u0027s two-variable theory. The mobility of the PAA chains has been followed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy using nitroxide spin labels covalently attached to the polymer, and the gelation of the pectin and alginate samples has been monitored using small deformation oscillatory experiments. For PAA at maximum binding, it was noted that there was a loss of chain mobility and precipitation. For pectin and alginate, gelation occurred and the stoichiometric ratio for maximum binding corresponded to the stoichiometric ratio for the maximum in G‘. Precipitation and gelation are attributed to the formation of polymer−metal complexes involving one or two carboxylate groups resulting in charge reversal or charge annihilation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Siew, C K","Williams, Peter A","Young, N W"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","doi":"10.1021/bm049341l","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":18064,"sim:weight":0.355519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99350,"sim:weight":0.292019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99455,"sim:weight":0.276656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99440,"sim:weight":0.270487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99102,"sim:weight":0.20006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98877,"sim:weight":0.198234,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385531,"sim:weight":0.193862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77025,"sim:weight":0.168893,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77031,"sim:weight":0.164786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98789,"sim:weight":0.161884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652822,"sim:weight":0.157963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46535,"sim:weight":0.154618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383930,"sim:weight":0.152984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.152828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98837,"sim:weight":0.152173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101462,"sim:weight":0.149468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98706,"sim:weight":0.148919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43648,"sim:weight":0.148676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98645,"sim:weight":0.148299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.146242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The HASE polymer consists of complex alkylaryl hydrophobes composed of oligomeric nonylphenol condensates attached to a poly(ethyl acrylate-co-methacrylic acid) backbone. The complex linear viscoelastic response of the polymer in alkaline solution suggests an unentangled network with an appreciable fraction of microgel. The concentration and hydrophile−lipophile balance (HLB) of nonionic surfactants profoundly affect the solution rheology. A surfactant of high HLB inhibits the dynamic network connectivity of the HASE polymer, as demonstrated by reductions of both the steady-shear viscosity and the dynamic storage modulus. The shear-induced structuring previously reported for this polymer is also progressively diminished as the surfactant concentration is increased. In contrast, the addition of a low-HLB surfactant promotes system structuring, as evidenced by (i) increases in the shear viscosity and the high-frequency plateau modulus and (ii) retention of the ability to undergo shear-induced structuring. We also employ cryofracture-replication transmission electron microscopy for the first time with regard to HASE associative polymers to examine the morphological characteristics of selected systems. The morphology of the HASE polymer in both latex and solubilized form appears more complex than previously anticipated, and a reasonable interpretation of these new data is provided.","bibo:AuthorList":["English, Rob J","Laurer, J H","Spontak, R J","Khan, S A"],"dc:date":"2002-01-01","doi":"10.1021/ie020409s","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98645,"sim:weight":0.252892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386663,"sim:weight":0.242082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385531,"sim:weight":0.241625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98706,"sim:weight":0.225276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102622,"sim:weight":0.223797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98789,"sim:weight":0.215518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43251,"sim:weight":0.213728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98459,"sim:weight":0.204242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383930,"sim:weight":0.201142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101462,"sim:weight":0.199957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43033,"sim:weight":0.194238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18038,"sim:weight":0.19176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46911,"sim:weight":0.186421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397563,"sim:weight":0.172743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43184,"sim:weight":0.17219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77025,"sim:weight":0.170552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352221,"sim:weight":0.167786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47651,"sim:weight":0.166692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26749,"sim:weight":0.164324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26627,"sim:weight":0.157879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At low [pyrene]/[hydrophobe] values, η, quencher-average aggregation numbers, Nq, calculated from the fitting of the fluorescence decay curves to the Infelta equation were found to decrease rapidly as η increased. By fitting the Nq vs η plots to a cubic curve [Warr, G. G.; Grieser, F. J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. 1 1986, 82, 1813], this observation was shown to be consistent with a highly skewed, polydisperse distribution of micelle aggregation numbers, described by a weight-average aggregation number of 75 and a standard deviation of 86. For a given polymer concentration in the range 1.0−2.5 g dL-1, the fluorescence decay curves did not produce parallel log(I/I0) vs time plots, as would be expected for a monodisperse array of micelles. Instead, the plots showed a characteristic intersection. Simulation of these curves using Infelta-type equations could not reproduce this behavior, indicating that a more refined model may be needed. This detailed study of the distribution of aggregation number in associative telechelic polymers is discussed in the context of recent investigations [Meng, X.-X.; Russel, W. B. Macromolecules 2005, 38, 593], from which it is suggested that polydispersity of micelle size is to be expected as a normal feature of such systems.","bibo:AuthorList":["English, Rob J","Ratcliffe, Ian","Blanchard, R L","Parsons, B J"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","doi":"10.1021/ma0624649","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":645464,"sim:weight":0.29684,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385531,"sim:weight":0.22633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81375,"sim:weight":0.206012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98789,"sim:weight":0.196823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269867,"sim:weight":0.190291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98645,"sim:weight":0.18231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105106,"sim:weight":0.180675,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44222,"sim:weight":0.168633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98706,"sim:weight":0.154782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46911,"sim:weight":0.153897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43648,"sim:weight":0.147844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99447,"sim:weight":0.147465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12371,"sim:weight":0.146294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98817,"sim:weight":0.140423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":360281,"sim:weight":0.140306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.140214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101462,"sim:weight":0.137063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101407,"sim:weight":0.136015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2391796,"sim:weight":0.132772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46779,"sim:weight":0.129696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It has been shown that GA and BSA can form soluble and insoluble complexes depending on the solution pH and the mixing ratio and is a function of the net charge on the complex. Soluble complexes were obtained when the electrophoretic mobility was greater than ±1. 5 μm s−1 V−1 cm−1. Changes in the value of the isoelectric point of the complexes with mixing ratio and isothermal titration calorimetric data indicated that complexes formed at pHs 3 and 4 consisted of  60 BSA molecules for every GA molecule, while at pH 5 there were  10 BSA molecules per GA molecule. Calorimetric studies also indicated that the interaction occurred in two stages at both pH 3 and pH 4, but that the nature of the interaction at these two pH values was significantly different. This was attributed to differences in the relative magnitude of the positive and negative charges on the BSA and GA, respectively, and possibly due to changes in the BSA conformation. The fact that there is an interaction at pH 5, which is above the isoelectric point of the BSA, is due to the interaction of the carboxylate groups on the GA with positive patches on the BSA or to the charge regulation of the protein−polysaccharide system brought about by changes in dissociation equilibria. Complexation is reduced as the ionic strength of the solvent increases and is prevented at a NaCl concentration of 120 mM.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vinayahan, T","Williams, Peter A","Phillips, G O"],"dc:date":"2010-11-01","doi":"10.1021/bm100486p","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101368,"sim:weight":0.379986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75488,"sim:weight":0.298664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99447,"sim:weight":0.29728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.267161,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99449,"sim:weight":0.262956,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98877,"sim:weight":0.257239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":485440,"sim:weight":0.257079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1650745,"sim:weight":0.242102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386663,"sim:weight":0.208218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44620,"sim:weight":0.189246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387390,"sim:weight":0.182381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.181042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101411,"sim:weight":0.178849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652822,"sim:weight":0.178492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710041,"sim:weight":0.170285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387366,"sim:weight":0.166886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145166,"sim:weight":0.163332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":777776,"sim:weight":0.156635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.156571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387413,"sim:weight":0.147858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The normalized root-mean-square values of sprung mass acceleration and tyre load forces are used to assess the vehicle ride comfort and handling performance based on five benchmark road profiles employed in industrial tests.","bibo:AuthorList":["Abramov, S","Mannan, S","Durieux, Olivier"],"dc:date":"2009-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43889,"sim:weight":0.523416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":865289,"sim:weight":0.508834,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45523,"sim:weight":0.452619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":767606,"sim:weight":0.447779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":767627,"sim:weight":0.387738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":950588,"sim:weight":0.384859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43316,"sim:weight":0.382268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81122,"sim:weight":0.380812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43929,"sim:weight":0.37399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43275,"sim:weight":0.351606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":926026,"sim:weight":0.34694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43591,"sim:weight":0.343672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44023,"sim:weight":0.322245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387002,"sim:weight":0.313602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145877,"sim:weight":0.30483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731238,"sim:weight":0.300674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":864207,"sim:weight":0.29358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50556,"sim:weight":0.281299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43468,"sim:weight":0.277635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50680,"sim:weight":0.265594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At the heart of the article is a detailed assessment of the impact of the civil war of the 1640s upon company membership and operations.  It is shown that although Chester’s involvement in the war inevitably disrupted company life and affairs, the impact was neither fatal nor long-lasting and most companies quickly recovered and, indeed, flourished in the immediate post-war and post-plague years, well before the Restoration of 1660.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bolton, Peter"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1929874,"sim:weight":0.257168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.227775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44207,"sim:weight":0.213106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381996,"sim:weight":0.196468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47545,"sim:weight":0.192127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710306,"sim:weight":0.189831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45255,"sim:weight":0.186053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387394,"sim:weight":0.1826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48242,"sim:weight":0.177958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77864,"sim:weight":0.176607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44785,"sim:weight":0.174592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74197,"sim:weight":0.171469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794279,"sim:weight":0.171168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45170,"sim:weight":0.170693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43553,"sim:weight":0.170213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387177,"sim:weight":0.169399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383592,"sim:weight":0.168008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382015,"sim:weight":0.166318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48399,"sim:weight":0.162319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.161688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The object was to study the effect of the cross-links in hylan on the various rheological parameters, in comparison with linear hyaluronan. There are significant differences. The Huggins constant and the critical overlap parameter C*[ ] are considerably lower for hylan and an increase in moduli at low frequencies was observed for hylan compared with the hyaluronan samples at all molecular weights studied. The results point to a difference in structure in dilute solution for hylan due to the ability to form networks, which can be removed by pressure filtration. In contrast, we do not find an increase of the steady shear viscosity and elastic modulus at higher concentrations when a homogeneous entangled network is reached. We attribute this behavior to the semirigid character of the hyaluronan chain and to the predominance of entanglements over the cross-link points present in hylan in the semidilute domain. Due to the higher apparent molecular weights that are possible with hylan structures but not with the hyaluronans currently available, a wider range of applications can be achieved with hylans when viscoelasticity is required, particularly for the viscosupplementation of synovial fluid damaged by osteoarthritis. © 2001 John Wiley \u0026 Sons, Inc.

Molecular associations can profoundly affect their performance in a given application due to its influence on the molecular weight, shape and size. This will ultimately determine how the molecules will interact with each other, with other molecules and with water. There are several factors, such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic association, ion mediated association, electrostatic interaction, concentration dependence and the presence of proteinaceous components, which affect this behaviour. Our objective is to highlight the role of the proteinaceous component, present in acacia gum, to promote associations when the gum is subjected to various processing treatments such as maturation, spray drying and irradiation. The results demonstrate the ability of the proteinaceous component to promote hydrophobic associations which influence the size and proportion of the arabinogalactan high molecular weight component (AGP). Heat treatment in solid state (maturation) increases the hydrophobic character of the gum and hence its emulsification performance. Spray drying also involves aggregation through hydrophobic association but changes the surface properties of peptide moieties to become more hydrophilic compared to the association promoted by the maturation treatment in the solid state.  Irradiation induced cross-linking, in the presence of unsaturated gas, was used to introduce C-C bonds into the carbohydrate moiety and thus confirms the hydrophobic association prompted by the heat used in the maturation and spray drying. This association can be reversed by treatments such as filtration or high pressure homogenisation. The results reported here reconcile the contradiction about structure of gum arabic proposed by the wattle blossom and twisted hairy rope models and shows that the AGP fraction is basically an aggregated fraction made up of AG units stabilised by low molecular weight highly proteinaceous components.      .","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Assaf, S","Sakata, M","McKenna, C","Aoki, H","Phillips, G O"],"dc:date":"2009-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99447,"sim:weight":0.26528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98609,"sim:weight":0.176743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99455,"sim:weight":0.175429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46779,"sim:weight":0.165398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.160147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386663,"sim:weight":0.158296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.155536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99102,"sim:weight":0.154128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102703,"sim:weight":0.145114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385531,"sim:weight":0.140145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381916,"sim:weight":0.139408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99449,"sim:weight":0.137336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43560,"sim:weight":0.134091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101264,"sim:weight":0.133455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23710,"sim:weight":0.131455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45222,"sim:weight":0.130666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99465,"sim:weight":0.129761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99501,"sim:weight":0.12596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98735,"sim:weight":0.125707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387413,"sim:weight":0.124058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The study explored responses to the statement in national, regional, and local news papers across the United States, England, and Northern Ireland. It was hypothesized that relational closeness to victims of the IRA campaign would affect attitudes toward the IRA apology, as would geographical closeness to the political violence in Northern Ireland; also within Northern Ireland there would be differences in attitudes toward the statement due to the ethnopolitical orientation of the newspapers\u0027 intended readership. The results broadly supported these hypotheses, with the U.S. print media being generally more positive and the English print media more negative in attitude toward the statement of apology. Also, among responses in England, those areas that had suffered directly from IRA violence tended to have the most negative reactions of all. In Northern Ireland, newspapers with a predominately Catholic readership responded to the IRA apology generally positively, whereas newspapers with a predominately Protestant readership responded generally negatively. The results illustrate difficulties facing peace processes in settings of ethnic violence and the complexity of responses to apology and forgiveness of relevant publics within and outside actual conflict areas.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ferguson, N","Binks, E","Roe, M D","Brown, J","Adams, T","Cruise, S M","Lewis, Christopher A"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1393447,"sim:weight":0.287895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98742,"sim:weight":0.265114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90830,"sim:weight":0.249553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43868,"sim:weight":0.234739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101283,"sim:weight":0.210635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929875,"sim:weight":0.195746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45277,"sim:weight":0.19034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46875,"sim:weight":0.176002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77621,"sim:weight":0.173886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10019,"sim:weight":0.173006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930627,"sim:weight":0.171135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383590,"sim:weight":0.164171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45356,"sim:weight":0.162516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381915,"sim:weight":0.161157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710567,"sim:weight":0.156166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930362,"sim:weight":0.155538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383415,"sim:weight":0.150941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45126,"sim:weight":0.150798,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931405,"sim:weight":0.148494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382082,"sim:weight":0.148463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In exploring participant perceptions of the DofE, the paper focuses on the way in which programme participation provided young people with new experiences, arguing that it offers them some insight into alternative ways of existence, other than crime. At the same time the programme was perceived by young people as instrumental to accessing this ‘existence’ and hence a possible route to realise their ambitions. Young people were acutely aware of having discredited identities as a function of their offending and the Award, by dint of attributes it was perceived to confer upon recipients, was understood as a way of repairing this damage and easing entry into, and acceptance by, mainstream society. Moreover, the skills and experiences imparted by the DofE were perceived as appropriate and useful for acquisition of social skills necessary to make this transition. The authors conclude that  DoE programme may usefully form part of  a broader offending  prevention programme because, based on the findings of this study of young people in custody, it may appeal to young disadvantaged young people, disillusioned by main stream education and who may be on the cusp of offending.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dubberley, Sarah","Parry, Odette"],"dc:date":"2010-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":82091,"sim:weight":0.395679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.387512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667584,"sim:weight":0.376674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9339993,"sim:weight":0.362237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45957,"sim:weight":0.355189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7960,"sim:weight":0.354962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.337053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44978,"sim:weight":0.311819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76475,"sim:weight":0.310598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101362,"sim:weight":0.296398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101388,"sim:weight":0.292765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496736,"sim:weight":0.248451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383630,"sim:weight":0.240629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.223835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387150,"sim:weight":0.222032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929826,"sim:weight":0.218432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5127,"sim:weight":0.214428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145895,"sim:weight":0.210698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.207502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709519,"sim:weight":0.207125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Research focusing on domestic violence programmes has mostly concentrated on the experiences of male perpetrators. As a result, less is known about how women feel about such programmes and the parallel safety services they are supposed to receive. This research seeks to address that weakness by exploring the perceptions of 13 women whose abusers are attending one perpetrator programme. The findings of our study suggest that women are generally negative about perpetrator programmes and require more comprehensive and coordinated services than are routinely made available to them. The paper suggests that women value and need direct and assertive support as well as safety services, and this need is especially pronounced in rural contexts where women can be isolated from mainstream services. The implications of the research to practice with victims of domestic violence are discussed to inform further development of IDAP and similar programmes in the UK and beyond.","bibo:AuthorList":["Madoc-Jones, Iolo","Roscoe, Karen"],"dc:date":"2010-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1539327,"sim:weight":0.451513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47200,"sim:weight":0.449304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77392,"sim:weight":0.448481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84892,"sim:weight":0.438822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383577,"sim:weight":0.420661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56922,"sim:weight":0.414182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47205,"sim:weight":0.409465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340178,"sim:weight":0.37182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104012,"sim:weight":0.371658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107345,"sim:weight":0.365343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44032,"sim:weight":0.364325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100347,"sim:weight":0.363166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104038,"sim:weight":0.362704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60796,"sim:weight":0.358637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.358046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340702,"sim:weight":0.357603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46560,"sim:weight":0.350842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10387,"sim:weight":0.338536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103945,"sim:weight":0.298312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56557,"sim:weight":0.288254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The starches were compared in terms of their microscopic, thermal, physicochemical and rheological properties.  Microscopy revealed smaller granule sizes of cocoyam starch compared with cassava. The amylose content was higher in cocoyam starch (33.3%) than in cassava starch (29.3%). Gelatinization in cassava starch occurred at a lower temperature range (60.11 o -72.67oC) compared with cocoyam (72.96o – 80.25oC) with the endothermic gelatinization enthalpy higher in cocoyam. The swelling power and solubility patterns indicated lower relaxation temperature, higher swelling and solubilization rates in cassava starch compared with cocoyam starch. The pasting characteristics of 8% (db, dry basis) starch slurry showed that cassava had higher peak viscosity but lower stability and setback ratios compared with cocoyam. This indicates that cocoyam starch paste is better in withstanding processing conditions and would present a superior thickening characteristic than cassava starch paste. The flow properties of both starch pastes showed non-Newtonian behaviour and could be best described by the Herschel-Bulkley model. The rate index and yield stress of cocoyam starch paste was higher than that of cassava. The storage modulus of cocoyam starch paste was higher than that of cassava indicating that cocoyam starch paste was more rigid than cassava starch paste. Cassava starch paste exhibited higher paste clarity and freeze-thaw stability than cocoyam starch paste. The properties of cassava and cocoyam starches dictate their food applications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Peter A","Nwokocha, Louis M","Aviara, Ndusbisi A","Senan, Chandra"],"dc:date":"2008-11-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":631001,"sim:weight":0.438241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":891025,"sim:weight":0.432037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":748975,"sim:weight":0.346115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":758232,"sim:weight":0.325526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":777279,"sim:weight":0.313871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":661432,"sim:weight":0.310475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99464,"sim:weight":0.294602,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99449,"sim:weight":0.28667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102968,"sim:weight":0.27478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99452,"sim:weight":0.192327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387329,"sim:weight":0.16257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710020,"sim:weight":0.143445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99447,"sim:weight":0.102609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":787633,"sim:weight":0.0980091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":834877,"sim:weight":0.0962091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99455,"sim:weight":0.090357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":837561,"sim:weight":0.0680008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18038,"sim:weight":0.0561364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101229,"sim:weight":0.0522025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99011,"sim:weight":0.0518057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The endosperm was found to constitute 67.15% of the whole seed and yielded 32.6% of gum. The Huggins and Kraemer plots obtained by capillary viscometry gave an intrinsic viscosity of 7.9 dL/g and viscosity average molecular mass was calculated to be 2.1 x 106 using the Mark Houwink relationship. The zero shear viscosity was plotted against the coil overlap parameter, C[ç], and the slopes of the lines in the dilute and semi-dilute regions were found to be  ~ 1.0 and 4.6  respectively. The curves were fitted to the Tuinier and Martin equations and showed only qualitative agreement.  The shear flow viscosity profiles indicated that M. flagellipes gum did not exhibit significant shear thinning at polymer concentrations less than 0.5%, however, at higher concentrations, pronounced shear thinning was observed with the relaxation time (ô) increasing with increase in polymer concentration. The dynamic viscosity profiles showed that at all polymer concentrations examined, a Newtonian plateau was obtained at low frequencies indicating that the loss modulus was the dominant response.

The optimal design was realized in hardware, using a printed structure to feed the dipoles independently; this was located in the normal plane to prevent distortion of the radiated fields.

However, at present, there is no direct evidence to support the assumption that Type D is categorical and able to differentiate true cases from noncases. Methods: In total, 1012 healthy young adults from across the United Kingdom and Ireland completed the DS14, the standard index of Type D, and scores were submitted to two taxometric procedures MAMBAC and MAXCOV. Results: Graphical representations (comparing actual with simulated data) and fit indices indicated that Type D is more accurately represented as a dimensional rather than categorical construct. Conclusion: Type D is better represented as a dimensional construct. Implications for theory development and clinical practice with respect to Type D are examined as well as the wider use of taxometrics within psychosomatic medicine (e.g., to investigate if there are medically unexplained syndrome taxons, such as a Gulf War Syndrome taxon).","bibo:AuthorList":["Ferguson, E","Williams, L","O\u0027Connor, R C","Howard, S","Hughes, B M","Johnston, D W","Allan, J A","O\u0027Connor, D B","Lewis, Christopher A","Grealy, M A","O\u0027Carroll, R E"],"dc:date":"2009-01-01","doi":"10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181bd888b","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":106970,"sim:weight":0.207694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99405,"sim:weight":0.202323,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":700888,"sim:weight":0.193584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43470,"sim:weight":0.180981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101247,"sim:weight":0.170319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101416,"sim:weight":0.167849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709866,"sim:weight":0.167396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26755,"sim:weight":0.166075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43103,"sim:weight":0.165957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145938,"sim:weight":0.163381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77481,"sim:weight":0.161617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25769,"sim:weight":0.156301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99371,"sim:weight":0.152952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.152664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387164,"sim:weight":0.150583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26649,"sim:weight":0.145838,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47124,"sim:weight":0.144762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102701,"sim:weight":0.142153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102619,"sim:weight":0.140253,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269869,"sim:weight":0.140194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This article emphasises the importance of incorporating structural and social factors. Drawing upon qualitative data from three separate studies, the author illustrates how stigmatisation, marginalisation, and social exclusion are significant debilitating components that have tended to be overlooked. This paper contributes new insights into the damaging impact of political rhetoric and structural discrimination that has placed many long-term drug users vulnerable to relapse. In response to these findings the author offers a new conceptual framework for practice that incorporates and promotes an understanding of the social nature and context of long-term drug dependence.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buchanan, Julian"],"dc:date":"2004-09-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":10479,"sim:weight":0.349183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145923,"sim:weight":0.272046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.263775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43534,"sim:weight":0.253932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269923,"sim:weight":0.21012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652672,"sim:weight":0.204934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.190582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1350122,"sim:weight":0.182038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98489,"sim:weight":0.180611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.171061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.171061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.171061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.171061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.171061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.171061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.171061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.171061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.171061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.171061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.171061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A total of 16 focus groups were carried out across eight schools to examine pupil\u0027s perceptions of food and food related behaviour. A key finding was the way in which control over choice of food and access to healthy/unhealthy food options differed between younger and older pupils across home, school and eating out settings. While older participants experienced and valued high levels of control over food choice in all three settings, this was not the case for younger participants. Pupils in year three had little choice, particularly at home and school, with other factors (such as security, structure and mealtime companionship) being more important to them than ability to choose what they ate. All participants in the study expressed a general preference for unhealthy as opposed to healthy food items, even when acknowledging health consequences and engaging in some compensatory strategies. The authors suggest that interventions should aim to educate and encourage food providers, such as parents/carers, schools, and food outlets, to produce a range of healthy options, and encourage informed food choice among children at a younger age.","bibo:AuthorList":["Warren, Emily","Parry, Odette","Lynch, R","Murphy, S"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1931311,"sim:weight":0.529763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1350000,"sim:weight":0.509058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102676,"sim:weight":0.452861,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2707825,"sim:weight":0.425726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18085,"sim:weight":0.387123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22729,"sim:weight":0.369463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83253,"sim:weight":0.362874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9624511,"sim:weight":0.356731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83254,"sim:weight":0.345229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2823,"sim:weight":0.339972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19158,"sim:weight":0.333291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77943,"sim:weight":0.326844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10376,"sim:weight":0.31791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83523,"sim:weight":0.312261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83517,"sim:weight":0.310742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99933,"sim:weight":0.287184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81591,"sim:weight":0.286881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1348456,"sim:weight":0.285977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3214,"sim:weight":0.28439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43875,"sim:weight":0.284359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The FDRP was developed as a child centred intervention aimed at resolving disputes involving children, without recourse to the courts. The evaluation comprised postal questionnaires for parents and qualitative interviews with a sample of parents, children and professionals engaging with the programme. Overall, both professionals and families were very positive about the programme. However, while valuing the FDRP child centred imperative, some parents found it (a) difficult to relinquish their attachment to personal grievances with the other parent and (b) less empowering. Also, while the programme was founded on the principle of agreement, for many of the interviewees issues of enforcement were also important. That is, some professionals argued that an element of compulsion was needed for parents to engage in the FDRP process and comply with agreed outcomes. Likewise, some parents said they wanted continued CAFCASS Cymru input to ensure that the agreed arrangements were observed. In conclusion, while both professionals and parents were highly supportive of the programme, they highlighted issues which have resource implications for an already resource heavy service.","bibo:AuthorList":["Warren, Emily","Parry, Odette","Buchanan, Julian","Ifans, Jonquil"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8999563,"sim:weight":0.425651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45644,"sim:weight":0.398863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145903,"sim:weight":0.395632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383650,"sim:weight":0.349366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17849,"sim:weight":0.34623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.33755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.329159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.284747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101445,"sim:weight":0.279242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77112,"sim:weight":0.275598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145739,"sim:weight":0.267268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47369,"sim:weight":0.244898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98713,"sim:weight":0.242317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44572,"sim:weight":0.241768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53847,"sim:weight":0.241644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340702,"sim:weight":0.240681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98688,"sim:weight":0.237743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710124,"sim:weight":0.235773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.235363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1541037,"sim:weight":0.234981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One of the consequences of this \u0027war on drugs\u0027 is that it manifests itself as a \u0027war on drug users\u0027 with an emphasis not upon the development of appropriate rehabilitative models, but upon prevention, prohibition and punishment.

Instead, growing numbers of problematic drug users remain locked into a cycle of chronic drug relapse.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buchanan, Julian","Young, L"],"dc:date":"2000-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":10479,"sim:weight":0.494212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100125,"sim:weight":0.467245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107315,"sim:weight":0.338609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145923,"sim:weight":0.326242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43534,"sim:weight":0.312142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.301219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77871,"sim:weight":0.269111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77220,"sim:weight":0.187815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1347928,"sim:weight":0.184527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383630,"sim:weight":0.182869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929826,"sim:weight":0.173725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18196,"sim:weight":0.173154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83504,"sim:weight":0.167242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104008,"sim:weight":0.158502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340902,"sim:weight":0.146689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1441356,"sim:weight":0.146689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7960,"sim:weight":0.145658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54165,"sim:weight":0.145585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43317,"sim:weight":0.142467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43845,"sim:weight":0.139191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The concepts of dependence and possible dependence are introduced and the relationship between them considered. Two measures of dependency, the dependency index and the fragmented dependency index are defined and formulated and an upper bound for each is derived.

The results of over 500 reported classification experiments were quantitatively analyzed. This involved examination of relationships between classification accuracy and date of publication, as well as between accuracy and various experimental parameters such as number of classes, size of feature vector, resolution of satellite data, and test area. Comparisons were also made between different types of methodology such as neural network and nonneural approaches. Overall, the results show that there has been no demonstrable improvement in classification performance over the 15-year period. The mean value of the Kappa coefficient across all experiments was found to be 0.6557 with a standard deviation of 0.1980. Expected relationships between classification accuracy and resolution and between accuracy and number of classes were also not observed in the data.

As technology advances the data rates and coverage of Wi-Fi increases and so the usage for different high bandwidth requirement applications increases. These enhancements to the technology do provide network design engineers with some significant problems when designing the network infrastructure. Prior to the installation of Access Points it is difficult to predict whether access can be guaranteed at specific locations. Additionally, to increase the level of security, it is often preferable, despite the use of security protocols, to ensure that the signal strength is not large enough to enable connection in areas other than those designated. Experience with existing equipment may not be sufficient to ensure a secure design. It is shown that it is likely that equipment built to the anticipated IEEE 802.11n specification that uses MIMO provide a far more complex situation than equipment designed to previous standards.\nBy combining the theory of antennae and the measurement of the performance of equipment built to the IEEE 802.11n draft, it is possible to create a mathematical model that can predict the network coverage which should be extendable to the new standard. Additionally it is argued that due to the backward compatibility of equipment then the increased data rates are not going to be realised until the all intended clients have been upgraded.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ogunjemilua, Kemisola","Davies, John N","Picking, Rich","Grout, Vic"],"dc:date":"2009-11-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1082633,"sim:weight":0.322079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.308048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1019164,"sim:weight":0.306693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145893,"sim:weight":0.262155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98604,"sim:weight":0.260391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43308,"sim:weight":0.257792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1130626,"sim:weight":0.254863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.254583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.254583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.254583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.254583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.254583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.254583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.254583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.254583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.254583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.254583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.254583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.254583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998247,"sim:weight":0.249437,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Various researchers have reported that traffic measurements demonstrate considerable burstiness on several time scales, with properties of self-similarity. The self-similar nature of this data traffic may exhibit spikiness and burstiness on large scales with such behaviour being caused by strong dependence characteristics in data: that is, large values tend to come in clusters and clusters of clusters and so on. Several studies have shown that TCP, the dominant network (Internet) transport protocol, contributes to the propagation of self-similarity. Bursty traffic can affect the Quality of Service of all traffic on the network by introducing inconsistent latency. It is easier to manage the workloads under less bursty (i.e. smoother) conditions. In this paper, we examine the use of a novel algorithm, the Bursty Packet Traffic Shaper (BPTraSha), for traffic shaping, which can smooth out the traffic burstiness. Experimental results show that this approach allows significant traffic control by smoothing the incoming traffic. BPTraSha can be implemented on the distribution router buffer so that the traffic’s bursty nature can be modified before it is transmitted over the core network.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mohammed Rezaul, Karim","Grout, Vic"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":982194,"sim:weight":0.591158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998720,"sim:weight":0.44564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":920162,"sim:weight":0.386964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998726,"sim:weight":0.356038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80882,"sim:weight":0.345739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998728,"sim:weight":0.334869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1015558,"sim:weight":0.310546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1058127,"sim:weight":0.269252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998721,"sim:weight":0.263136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102618,"sim:weight":0.242464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":982191,"sim:weight":0.23289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101379,"sim:weight":0.217111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103079,"sim:weight":0.215049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":894197,"sim:weight":0.192291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1041455,"sim:weight":0.189406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26733,"sim:weight":0.185824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101224,"sim:weight":0.180242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":120725,"sim:weight":0.180125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43308,"sim:weight":0.176608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26670,"sim:weight":0.175727,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study replicates earlier research he carried out in 1984 that investigated the religious beliefs and values of both Catholic and Protestant pupils in schools. The data provided by 1,099 Protestant pupils and by 1,270 Catholic pupils confirm Greer’s earlier conclusion that there are significant and consistent differences in the religious profiles of the two denominational groups. Some of the implications of this finding for accounts of the nature of the process of secularisation and for education and schooling in Northern Ireland are considered.","bibo:AuthorList":["Francis, L J","Robbins, M","Barnes, L P","Lewis, Christopher A"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","doi":"10.1163/157092506778884508","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46793,"sim:weight":0.484572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.450102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102729,"sim:weight":0.376007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382460,"sim:weight":0.362765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43656,"sim:weight":0.324666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46802,"sim:weight":0.315726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46562,"sim:weight":0.31554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59066,"sim:weight":0.311824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732403,"sim:weight":0.305639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46984,"sim:weight":0.304575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":838736,"sim:weight":0.301991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269878,"sim:weight":0.29854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45687,"sim:weight":0.292794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61043,"sim:weight":0.288756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387272,"sim:weight":0.286449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101496,"sim:weight":0.281193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46559,"sim:weight":0.279439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101283,"sim:weight":0.269628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46769,"sim:weight":0.268597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.250036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Study 1 (N \u003d 480) revealed that among the pro-Pinochet and the anti-Pinochet groups in Chile, forgiveness was predicted by ingroup identity (negatively), common ingroup identity (positively), empathy and trust (positively), and competitive victimhood (the subjective sense of having suffered more than the outgroup, negatively). Political ideology (Right vs. Left) moderated the relationship between empathy and forgiveness, trust and forgiveness, and between the latter and competitive victimhood. Study 2 (N \u003d 309), set in the Northern Irish conflict between Protestants and Catholics, provided a replication and extension of Study 1. Finally, Study 3 (N \u003d 155/108) examined the longitudinal relationship between forgiveness and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, revealing that forgiveness predicted reconciliation intentions. The reverse direction of this relationship was also marginally significant. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical implications.","bibo:AuthorList":["Noor, N","Brown, R","Gonzalez, R","Manzi, J","Lewis, Christopher A"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","doi":"10.1177/0146167208315555","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":387090,"sim:weight":0.444599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102273,"sim:weight":0.278562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101283,"sim:weight":0.275495,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709956,"sim:weight":0.268614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":322398,"sim:weight":0.245292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":990206,"sim:weight":0.225462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101623,"sim:weight":0.212547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393447,"sim:weight":0.200703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101571,"sim:weight":0.190641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90972,"sim:weight":0.165411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101479,"sim:weight":0.155146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22778,"sim:weight":0.150883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45277,"sim:weight":0.150053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102662,"sim:weight":0.143365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101625,"sim:weight":0.142619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387247,"sim:weight":0.139034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26084,"sim:weight":0.13728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47371,"sim:weight":0.137255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43868,"sim:weight":0.134749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710080,"sim:weight":0.133761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It was also found that the brightest emission is obtained when the phosphor particles have a very heavily multiply twinned structure together with a rough profile, and least output when they show the cubic phase. Examination of the electroluminescence output of individual phosphor grains indicates that emission is mostly from material close to the surface and suggests that field emission occurs from the surface which is aided by a marked surface roughness.

In the latter case, there is a complete change in the morphology of the gel that has a direct impact on its macroscopic properties, specifically its gel-sol transition temperature.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hirst, A R","Smith, D K","Fieters, M C","Geurts, H P","Wright, Andrew C"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","doi":"10.1021/ja036111q","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":625596,"sim:weight":0.203688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":584874,"sim:weight":0.203371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99449,"sim:weight":0.188215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76604,"sim:weight":0.173431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":778805,"sim:weight":0.173149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99501,"sim:weight":0.168754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44058,"sim:weight":0.161259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98877,"sim:weight":0.158829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.15737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46602,"sim:weight":0.156962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1115219,"sim:weight":0.14939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105057,"sim:weight":0.144648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27178,"sim:weight":0.137434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":838050,"sim:weight":0.135058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58190,"sim:weight":0.131763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99391,"sim:weight":0.131206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397079,"sim:weight":0.129711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.125472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99465,"sim:weight":0.120309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50780,"sim:weight":0.119696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The article contextualizes the experience of the Welsh speakers historically, making links with the experience of other indigenous national linguistic minorities worldwide. The importance of language choice is discussed and the reality of linguistic choice within the CJS in Wales is explored in a small scale study with probation staff. Their responses to a brief questionnaire indicate that language choice is not a reality for the majority of Welsh speakers in Wales. The judicial and rehabilitative consequences of this lack of choice are explored. It is argued that a focus on non-discrimination in policy and practice at the international and national level, the vagueness of linguistic rights legislation and the centralization of the CJS in the UK leads to the oppression of Welsh speakers offenders in the criminal justice system in Wales. This article proposes that a passive approach to language choice for indigenous linguistic minorities like the Welsh is unacceptable and that a proactive commitment to linguistically sensitive practice should be adopted on the basis of social justice, equal opportunities and to effectively engage with offenders to protect the public. Nine principles for effective criminal justice practice with Welsh speakers in Wales are proposed which it is argued, have wider applicability with indigenous/substate national linguistic communities worldwide.","bibo:AuthorList":["Madoc-Jones, Iolo","Buchanan, Julian"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":340553,"sim:weight":0.314829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":583450,"sim:weight":0.279281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10019,"sim:weight":0.26656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94161,"sim:weight":0.238112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382759,"sim:weight":0.213035,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":465715,"sim:weight":0.204486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98725,"sim:weight":0.203499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101631,"sim:weight":0.202124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94146,"sim:weight":0.196757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731257,"sim:weight":0.194002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104008,"sim:weight":0.192758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102723,"sim:weight":0.185201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47285,"sim:weight":0.164976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7960,"sim:weight":0.154939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269950,"sim:weight":0.15335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929826,"sim:weight":0.150217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18100,"sim:weight":0.146945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.146424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1152086,"sim:weight":0.145581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1632000,"sim:weight":0.144228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Telephone support services are tailored differentially to offer information, advice and/or counselling on a crisis-led or planned-intervention basis. Research focusing on telephone support, for the most part (and particularly in the UK) has examined crisis-led as opposed to planned support services. The findings of our study resonate with earlier research findings about telephone support that suggest provision of non-visual support in social care can overcome some practical and financial difficulties for users with little discernible loss to their experience of satisfaction with the service. In addition, the paper suggests that planned support may provide a valuable service to users who are most disadvantaged and marginalized and who have found traditional forms of support unsatisfactory. For such users, planned telephone support can offer one-to-one communication tailored to specific client needs. Moreover, it can enable the development of user trust in the service which empowers users to operationalize strategies in the context of a reliable, sustained, unthreatening (and thus minimal risk) relationship.","bibo:AuthorList":["Madoc-Jones, Iolo","Warren, Emily","Ashdown-Lambert, Joan","Williams, E","Parry, Odette"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2206.2006.00471.x","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664721,"sim:weight":0.291865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82995,"sim:weight":0.268643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48295,"sim:weight":0.23526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1666846,"sim:weight":0.231813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.229264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91645,"sim:weight":0.223621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.214984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1496274,"sim:weight":0.214461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43727,"sim:weight":0.212245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.204297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931034,"sim:weight":0.183618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98764,"sim:weight":0.180843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83001,"sim:weight":0.177453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1668498,"sim:weight":0.175616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.175366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.175366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.175366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.175366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.175366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.175366,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Religious Status Inventory—\u0027Being Ethical\u0027 subscale represents one approach. However, at present there is limited information on the psychometric properties of either the original 20-item version (RSInv-20) or the shortened embedded 10-item version (RSInv-S10). The aim of the present study was to provide psychometric data on the internal reliability of these two versions of the \u0027Being Ethical\u0027 subscale. As part of a larger study, 595 Northern Irish adolescents, drawn from both Grammar and Secondary schools, completed the RSInv-20. An unsatisfactory level of internal reliability was found for the RSInv-20 (Cronbach\u0027s alpha \u003d 0.42), but a satisfactory level of internal reliability was found for the RSInv-S10 (Cronbach\u0027s alpha \u003d 0.70). Subsequent item analysis produced an alternative 10-item version (RSInv-A10) that provided the optimum level of internal reliability for a 10-item measure in the present sample (Cronbach\u0027s alpha \u003d 0.74). In addition, on all three versions of the measure (RSInv-20, RSInv-S10, and RSInv-A10), differences were found in levels of internal reliability among Grammar and Secondary school respondents, with the former producing higher levels of internal reliability.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mullan, M","Lewis, Christopher A"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","doi":"10.1080/13617670701485821","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43504,"sim:weight":0.188235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47187,"sim:weight":0.187971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46803,"sim:weight":0.184251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107632,"sim:weight":0.179514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48872,"sim:weight":0.166374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82296,"sim:weight":0.160288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4623,"sim:weight":0.160155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47272,"sim:weight":0.158415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26084,"sim:weight":0.158041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385525,"sim:weight":0.157288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46782,"sim:weight":0.15303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1388440,"sim:weight":0.148129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.145689,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57786,"sim:weight":0.145388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101283,"sim:weight":0.144915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99933,"sim:weight":0.143643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1007605,"sim:weight":0.14172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1118048,"sim:weight":0.138984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18046,"sim:weight":0.137792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102619,"sim:weight":0.134873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The overall aim of the thesis is to examine young offenders‟ engagement with the DofE, and implications for their experiences while in the secure estate, and subsequently following their release into the community. The research draws on focus groups with young people in young offenders institutions, secure training centres and secure children‟s homes in England and Wales (pre and post implementation of the DoE programme), and interviews with secure estate staff delivering the programme. Interviews were also carried out with DofE management and a sample of Youth Offending Team (YOT) staff. In addition, an online questionnaire was distributed to all YOT managers across England and Wales.  The findings of the study indicate that the DofE was popular with participants (both young people and staff) for several reasons. These included the opportunity for young people to engage in activities which were new to them, the hands –on approach to programme delivery, the transference of a range of both technical and more „indeterminate‟ social/individual skills, the perceived status of the qualification, and, related to this, perceived potential to facilitate access to more opportunities for young people, post release.  Barriers to implementation were mainly a function of institutional constraints, particularly in relation to risk. Moreover, constraints on the programme delivery, posed by the secure estate, appeared to challenge the Award‟s claim to inclusiveness (that its accessibility to all). A particular challenge for the DofE was maintaining the reputation of the Award (associated with the positive attributes it is claimed to confer upon recipients) while widening access by implementation to young offenders in the secure estate.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dubberley, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2010-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":82091,"sim:weight":0.451415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9339993,"sim:weight":0.378702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83001,"sim:weight":0.366708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100354,"sim:weight":0.349118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.320077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352235,"sim:weight":0.299061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7960,"sim:weight":0.282613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76475,"sim:weight":0.267927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44978,"sim:weight":0.263962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83998,"sim:weight":0.219648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.201725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.197122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.197122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.197122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.197122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.197122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.197122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.197122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.197122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.197122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The spiral is logarithmic in line spacing and width such that the width of the spiral line increases smoothly with the increase of the current density, reaching its maximum where the current density is maximum (in its center for 2 resonators). Preliminary results of such a logarithmic ten-turn (2 5 turns) spiral, realized with double-sided YBCO thin film, showed a -factor seven times higher than that of a single ten-turn uniform spiral made of YBCO thin film and 64 times higher than a copper counterpart. The insertion loss of the YBCO dual log-spiral has a high degree of independence of the input power in comparison with a uniform Archimedian spiral, increasing by only 2.5% for a 30-dBm increase of the input power, compared with nearly 31% for the uniform spiral. A simple approximate method, developed for prediction of the resonant frequency of the new resonators, shows a good agreement with the test results.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hejazi, Z M","Excell, Peter S"],"dc:date":"2002-06-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631496,"sim:weight":0.329424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1928421,"sim:weight":0.244074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631735,"sim:weight":0.234126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929901,"sim:weight":0.225266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931560,"sim:weight":0.211091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931321,"sim:weight":0.209581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931533,"sim:weight":0.175005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46778,"sim:weight":0.17472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931464,"sim:weight":0.161292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352904,"sim:weight":0.146215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352176,"sim:weight":0.143037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146058,"sim:weight":0.139595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99211,"sim:weight":0.137959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46257,"sim:weight":0.135177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43478,"sim:weight":0.133452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18098,"sim:weight":0.132022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664550,"sim:weight":0.130859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23351,"sim:weight":0.124484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26371,"sim:weight":0.12291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26193,"sim:weight":0.119933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Long-range dependence (LRD) is of great significance in traffic engineering problems such as measurement, queuing strategy, buffer sizing and admission and congestion control. In this research, in order to determine the existence of LRD, we apply three different robust versions of the autocorrelation function (ACF), namely weighted ACF (WACF), trimmed ACF (TACF) and variance-ratio of differences and sums, known as the D/S variance estimator (DACF), in conjunction with the sample ACF (which is moment based). Here we define the moment based ACF as MACF. In telecommunications, LRD traffic defines that a similar pattern of traffic persists for a longer span of time. Through ACF, it is possible to detect how long the traffic lasts. The aim of this research is to investigate the performance of ACF in identifying the existence of LRD traffic.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mohammed Rezaul, Karim","Grout, Vic"],"dc:date":"2007-10-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8998720,"sim:weight":0.450205,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998724,"sim:weight":0.43282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998721,"sim:weight":0.380411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":982194,"sim:weight":0.351561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54287,"sim:weight":0.281595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":971770,"sim:weight":0.242492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1058241,"sim:weight":0.195318,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102618,"sim:weight":0.141043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103079,"sim:weight":0.125068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":901800,"sim:weight":0.122801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18129,"sim:weight":0.11073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.102704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.102704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.102704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.102704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.102704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.102704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.102704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.102704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.102704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Three samples eluted from the column using 4 M NaCl as solvent (fractions 1A, 1B, and 1C), two fractions eluted using 2 M NaCl (fractions 2A and 2B), and one fraction eluted using water (fraction 3). The fractions were shown to be very polydisperse, and differences between the GPC refractive index and UV absorbance (214 nm) elution profiles demonstrated chemical heterogeneity. They were found to contain significantly different proportions of protein (1A, 2.79%; 1B, 0.97%; 1C, 0.77%; 2A, 1.41%; 2B, 5.09%; and 3, 5.89%) and ferulic acid (approximately 1A, 0.5%; 1B, 0.5%; 1C, 0.9%; 2B, 1.5%; and 3, 2%). The weight-average molecular mass, Mw, of the fractions also varied (1A, 153 kDa; 1B, 155 kDa; 1C, 306 kDa; 2A, 562 kDa; 2B, 470 kDa; 3, 282 kDa). Three fractions, that is, 1A, 1B, and 3, produced orange oil emulsions with a relatively small droplet size that were stable over a period of weeks. The other three fractions (1C, 2A, and 2B with higher Mw values) produced emulsions with an initially larger droplet size, and the droplet size increased considerably over time. The increased droplet size may be influenced by the viscosity of the aqueous continuous phase. There was no simple relationship between protein or ferulic acid content and emulsification ability. For example, fraction 1B, which contained the lowest proportion of both protein and ferulic acid, produced stable emulsions of similar droplet size to fraction 3, which contained the largest proportion of protein and ferulic acid. The role of protein in the emulsification process was investigated by measuring the amount of protein in the aqueous phase before and after emulsification. It was clearly demonstrated that proteinaceous material adsorbed at the oil−water interface. It is evident that the emulsification properties of sugar beet pectin are influenced by the accessibility of the protein and ferulic acid groups to the surface of the oil droplets, the proportion of ester groups, and the molecular mass distribution of the fractions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, Peter A","Sayers, C","Viebke, C","Senan, Chandra","Mazoyer, J","Poulenguer, P"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","doi":"10.1021/jf0404142","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1653844,"sim:weight":0.426693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631673,"sim:weight":0.28866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387341,"sim:weight":0.269764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2809841,"sim:weight":0.264109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145983,"sim:weight":0.233539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43281,"sim:weight":0.182929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99447,"sim:weight":0.178079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930158,"sim:weight":0.170458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386663,"sim:weight":0.169516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99102,"sim:weight":0.166508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.163299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47651,"sim:weight":0.151037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145166,"sim:weight":0.146905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.145228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631819,"sim:weight":0.13975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44827,"sim:weight":0.135856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54191,"sim:weight":0.135809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381916,"sim:weight":0.135221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46535,"sim:weight":0.126941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75677,"sim:weight":0.126077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Generally, a transition metal such as nickel dispersed as clusters on a nonreactive substrate acts as a catalyst for growth from carbon-bearing gases such as acetylene.

Using Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (STM) to study the clusters and high resolution Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) to study the resultant nanotubes, we show that nickel clusters created on TiN-coated SiC substrates have a much smaller size distribution than MoSi2-coated SiC substrates.

The 3-D multi-pass SAR imaging system is typically characterised by a relatively short ambiguity length in the elevation direction. To minimise the associated ambiguities we exploit the relative phase information within the set of images to track the terrain landscape.

This study has two main objectives, firstly it illustrates suitable methods to secure the signalling and voice traffic within a VoIP system, secondly it evaluates the performance of a VoIP system after implementing different security methods. This study is carried out on a pilot system using an asterisk based SIP (Session initiation Protocol) server (Asterisk, 2009).\nSince VoIP is intended for use over the Internet, VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) have been used in a tunnel configuration to provide the service.

It exploits more than two flight passes to achieve a desired resolution in elevation. In this paper, a novel approach is developed to reconstruct a 3D space-borne SAR image with multiple-pass processing. It involves image registration, phase correction and elevational imaging. An image model matching is developed for multiple image registration, an eigenvector method is proposed for the phase correction and the elevational imaging is conducted using a Fourier transform or a super-resolution method for enhancement of elevational resolution. 3D SAR images are obtained by processing simulated data and real data from the first European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-1) with the proposed approaches.","bibo:AuthorList":["She, Zhishun","Gray, D A","Bogner, R E","Homer, J","Longstaff, I D"],"dc:date":"2002-10-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":490909,"sim:weight":0.369099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58631,"sim:weight":0.366866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931147,"sim:weight":0.337308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98572,"sim:weight":0.335057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":899702,"sim:weight":0.304969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102613,"sim:weight":0.301732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":799741,"sim:weight":0.300391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62364,"sim:weight":0.294007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":659154,"sim:weight":0.29162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1009669,"sim:weight":0.286345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":729336,"sim:weight":0.275801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":717222,"sim:weight":0.266642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269925,"sim:weight":0.263138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":659034,"sim:weight":0.256874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000434,"sim:weight":0.248355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98683,"sim:weight":0.248213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":919942,"sim:weight":0.241021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99264,"sim:weight":0.234844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":851645,"sim:weight":0.211265,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9001874,"sim:weight":0.210681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The roles of psychopathology, irrationality and grievance/threat are examined, followed by empirical research on the beliefs which have been associated with the perpetration and support of terrorist violence, and the social factors which foster those beliefs, including social identity, socially carried interpretations, group leadership and individual differences. Although religion is not a single, simple causal factor in terrorist violence, religious elements often feature strongly in the belief systems associated with terrorist violence, and can also feature in other important fostering factors for terrorist violence, such as the use of rhetoric. Finally, the status of lay explanations of terrorist violence, focusing on the role of religious fundamentalism is examined.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rogers, M B","Loewenthal, K M","Lewis, Christopher A","Amlot, R","Cinnirella, M","Ansari, H"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","doi":"10.1080/09540260701349399","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":104012,"sim:weight":0.387965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90232,"sim:weight":0.252698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":319308,"sim:weight":0.252698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633033,"sim:weight":0.24494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7960,"sim:weight":0.243527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":800012,"sim:weight":0.238286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102691,"sim:weight":0.233761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633015,"sim:weight":0.228763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633039,"sim:weight":0.228229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633004,"sim:weight":0.225869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633014,"sim:weight":0.215933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.212489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633032,"sim:weight":0.209322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633035,"sim:weight":0.186098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76336,"sim:weight":0.183118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145887,"sim:weight":0.182612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101283,"sim:weight":0.180991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633021,"sim:weight":0.179752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99509,"sim:weight":0.168676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26084,"sim:weight":0.165513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A panel of independent referees analysed incidents (n \u003d 144) taken from five referees in seven games in the New Zealand Football Championship (2005/06). The match-day referees made accurate decisions on 64% of the incidents, although their accuracy levels were not related to variables such as movement speed, HR, and cumulative distance covered. Interestingly, referees were on average only 51% accurate in the opening fifteen minutes of each half compared to 70% accuracy at all other times.

This article arises out of a three year qualitative study (2008-2010) which focused on identifying the experiences of stake-holders (children and parents of Eastern European heritage and their teachers) where migrant children enter primary schools which have previously had limited exposure to cultural and linguistic diversity. Although many migrant children settle successfully and progress within the UK education system, much can be done in terms of educational policy and practice to ensure that these learners are appropriately supported. This paper examines some of the factors impacting upon migrant children’s learning and well-being, and offers guidance to practitioners as how to develop inclusive and individualized learning and social contexts for these learners.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hamilton, Paula"],"dc:date":"2011-02-01","doi":"10.1080/03004279.2011.569737","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":82298,"sim:weight":0.413379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103117,"sim:weight":0.409549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710639,"sim:weight":0.403782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2851,"sim:weight":0.374575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60732,"sim:weight":0.370326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.364721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82037,"sim:weight":0.362202,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709977,"sim:weight":0.35744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.350598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.3288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55808,"sim:weight":0.326731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709553,"sim:weight":0.325756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.307307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55754,"sim:weight":0.295461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98688,"sim:weight":0.286378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18102,"sim:weight":0.282436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46829,"sim:weight":0.276112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.275514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2731196,"sim:weight":0.275117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382428,"sim:weight":0.27365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Since then policy and practice has largely been shaped by psychological and medical perspectives that emphasise the physiological and psychological nature of dependence. Concerned by the limited impact in reducing the number of problem drug users, in 2000 the Government shifted the emphasis away from voluntary treatment by the Health and Voluntary sector, towards coercive treatment, initially in the form of a Drug Treatment and Testing Order (DTTOs). The Criminal Justice Interventions Programme (CJIP), a £447m programme to ‘direct drug misusing offenders out of crime and into treatment’ (Home Office, 2004 p. 29) further illustrates and reinforces this shift. This article argues that this shift in approach is also likely to founder, as it continues to be dominated by a narrow focus on the individual and their drug dependence, and fails to adequately address the social context, nature and underlying causes of problem drug use.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buchanan, Julian"],"dc:date":"2004-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":100125,"sim:weight":0.55309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10479,"sim:weight":0.448561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145923,"sim:weight":0.35215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43534,"sim:weight":0.316193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667483,"sim:weight":0.300872,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77871,"sim:weight":0.288876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99064,"sim:weight":0.286933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":100354,"sim:weight":0.262385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929826,"sim:weight":0.24957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1347928,"sim:weight":0.244418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77220,"sim:weight":0.243895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66882,"sim:weight":0.235215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10019,"sim:weight":0.232182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104008,"sim:weight":0.226572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1395231,"sim:weight":0.219657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51960,"sim:weight":0.214503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43523,"sim:weight":0.213737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99222,"sim:weight":0.204126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18124,"sim:weight":0.201048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":7960,"sim:weight":0.20053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This is exemplified in the literature that has systematically employed the Francis Scale of Attitude toward Christianity alongside two different measures of happiness among a variety of samples. Two opposing conclusions have found consistent support.

Whether it is conducting a formal debate, participating in a group discussion, writing an essay, a critique or a persuasive appeal, the ability of the student to employ argument and to anticipate and evaluate the arguments of others will generally be an important measure of achievement.\nMy purpose in this paper is to outline some key issues involved in teaching, learning and assessing critical thinking, reasoning and argument skills in higher education (HE). When examining arguments for teaching and learning such skills, with undergraduate and postgraduate students, I focus on two issues. The first concerns the view articulated by Garner (2006, p.2) that ‘… many students with top grade A-level passes… had been coached to answer the questions they would face but had little knowledge or understanding [of how] to develop an argument’.\nThe second issue concerns the concept of ‘indoctrination’. I argue that, to some extent, indoctrination is an essential and unavoidable part of the educational process. Having made a distinction between justifiable and unjustifiable indoctrination and offered the view that indoctrination is, in some sense, an ‘illness’ which pervades educational institutions, I suggest that teaching students the skills of thinking, reasoning and argument provides an ‘antidote’ to it.","bibo:AuthorList":["Costello, Patrick J"],"dc:date":"2007-11-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5465,"sim:weight":0.382947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710580,"sim:weight":0.365817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.348191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53520,"sim:weight":0.348071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.339026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.335718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.33207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.326759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1560,"sim:weight":0.323946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.31712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.315726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99108,"sim:weight":0.314207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82322,"sim:weight":0.310649,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.307556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55554,"sim:weight":0.303389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631728,"sim:weight":0.297666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26502,"sim:weight":0.292314,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104691,"sim:weight":0.289192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41347,"sim:weight":0.287567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.28228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For comparison, the same measurements were made for the reactions of the free radicals OH, Br2−, and N3. The carbonate and dichloride radical anions were found to react relatively quickly with HA (7.0 × 105 and 6.9 × 106 dm3 mol−1 s−1, respectively) although they are much less reactive than the hydroxyl radical, OH. Significant yields (20 and 38%, respectively) of chain scission of HA by these radical anions were also determined from the gpc/MALLS experiments, providing some support for their potential participation in the depolymerization of HA in vivo. These results are compared with data obtained for the other free radicals (hydroxyl, azide radicals, and dibromide radical anions) investigated in this study in order to gain an insight into their mechanism of reaction with HA. Earlier chain scission yields of HA by hydroxyl radicals determined by the authors have also been revised using the gpc/MALLS technique employed in the current study. The yields of 52% (absence of air) and 44% (in air) are much lower than the previous values. In the current study, the effect of oxygen on the yields of HA chain breaks is discussed in terms of the reactivity of HA peroxyl radicals in the presence of superoxide radical anions.

Willd. var. senegal with enhanced properties (Acacia (sen) SUPER GUM™): Part 1—Controlled maturation of Acacia senegal var. senegal to increase viscoelasticity, produce a hydrogel form and convert a poor into a good emulsifier","bibo:abstract":"The Acacia gum (Acacia senegal var. senegal), which is a food additive approved by Codex Alimentarius, is defined within the Acacia subgenus (family Leguminosae). The structural characteristics associated with a “poor” and “good” emulsifying A. senegal var. senegal exudate gum are identified and it is shown that it is possible to maturate the “poor” emulsifier in a process comparable to that which occurs to the exudate gum as the age of the tree increases from 1 to 15 years and when the gum is stored naturally after collection. Thus, the molecular parameters of the “good” gum can be matched, and the emulsification effectiveness can attain the level of the “good” emulsifier.  The process can be further continued to produce a series of gums of precisely structured molecular dimensions with improved properties and if the maturation is continued can yield a hydrogel form of Acacia. The new forms of A. senegal which are described here, and which have not previously been available are designated Acacia (sen) SUPER GUM™ which are constant in properties and with precisely structured molecular dimensions, unlike the naturally occurring gum. The viscosity can be increased up to 20 times compared to the starting material. The controlling factor is the agglomeration of the proteinaceous components within the molecularly disperse system that is A. senegal gum to increase the amount of arabinogalactan protein (AGP) emulsifying component up to more than double the amount present originally. This results in a dramatic increase in the interfacial surface properties and coverage of the oil droplet in oil in water emulsion. No other chemical change is initiated by the maturation process.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Assaf, S","Phillips, G O","Aokia, H","Sasaki, Y"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","doi":"10.1016/j.foodhyd.2006.04.011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":59115,"sim:weight":0.38682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54477,"sim:weight":0.377341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1094554,"sim:weight":0.235751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99447,"sim:weight":0.199484,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1004356,"sim:weight":0.177216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76397,"sim:weight":0.160924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43281,"sim:weight":0.156461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99455,"sim:weight":0.155311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386663,"sim:weight":0.148589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1116601,"sim:weight":0.147307,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387341,"sim:weight":0.146016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18038,"sim:weight":0.138465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1115257,"sim:weight":0.128233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62357,"sim:weight":0.125272,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631673,"sim:weight":0.121785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99047,"sim:weight":0.117709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99501,"sim:weight":0.114399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99440,"sim:weight":0.113608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1078896,"sim:weight":0.113512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99465,"sim:weight":0.112503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

One hundred and thirty eight UK adults completed two measures of both religiosity (the ‘Age Universal’ Religious Orientation Scale [Intrinsic and Extrinsic subscales] and the Religious Coping Scale [Positive and Negative subscales]) and happiness (the Depression–Happiness Scale and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire Short-Form). In general, no significant associations were found between religiosity scores and happiness scores. However, both higher intrinsic orientation scores and positive religious coping were significantly associated with higher scores on the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire Short-Form. It is proposed that these differential findings are consistent with the theoretical distinction between subjective and psychological well-being. It is suggested that when religiosity is related to happiness, it is related to psychological well-being, which is thought to reflect human development, positive functioning and existential life challenges.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lewis, Christopher A","Maltby, J","L, Day"],"dc:date":"2005-01-01","doi":"10.1016/j.paid.2004.08.002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46726,"sim:weight":0.537637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46800,"sim:weight":0.533092,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23221,"sim:weight":0.417483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24904,"sim:weight":0.385195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383662,"sim:weight":0.325111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43682,"sim:weight":0.288914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47272,"sim:weight":0.27725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46799,"sim:weight":0.274657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99200,"sim:weight":0.271467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":31287,"sim:weight":0.244796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26084,"sim:weight":0.237259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46803,"sim:weight":0.228881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633039,"sim:weight":0.2215,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710078,"sim:weight":0.206025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45935,"sim:weight":0.179958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58437,"sim:weight":0.176238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":723278,"sim:weight":0.162326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48400,"sim:weight":0.158372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46699,"sim:weight":0.156757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47124,"sim:weight":0.152019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Various researchers have reported traffic measurements that demonstrate considerable burstiness on a range of time scales with properties of self-similarity.  Rapid technological development has widened the scope of network and Internet applications and, in turn, increased traffic volume.  The exponential growth of the number of servers, as well as the number of users, causes Internet performance to be problematic as a result of the significant impact that long-range dependent traffic has on buffer requirements.  Consequently, accurate and reliable measurement, analysis and control of Internet traffic are vital.  The most significant techniques for performance evaluation include theoretical analysis, simulation, and empirical study based on measurement.  In this research, we discuss existing and recent developments in performance evaluation and control tools used in network traffic engineering.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mohammed Rezaul, Karim","Grout, Vic"],"dc:date":"2007-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8998720,"sim:weight":0.413665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":920162,"sim:weight":0.376843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664532,"sim:weight":0.237442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58797,"sim:weight":0.223617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":823300,"sim:weight":0.223225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59020,"sim:weight":0.200013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99087,"sim:weight":0.19523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46815,"sim:weight":0.195113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68122,"sim:weight":0.179755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43308,"sim:weight":0.178614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.176044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.176044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.176044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.176044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.176044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.176044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.176044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.176044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.176044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.176044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, using this type of antenna may degrade the antenna performance, such as bandwidth and gain, although these antennas can cause less effect on the body to which they are adjacent. Moreover, if these antennas are well-designed, then the maximum specific absorption rate (SAR) values are likely to be reduced when placed next to the human head, since the coupling of such antennas to the body of the handset is very weak. In this paper, a study on balanced and unbalanced antennas for mobile handsets next to the human head is presented, using a hybrid electromagnetic method for the analysis. The method uses the hybridisation technique between the frequency domain Method of Moments (MoM) and the Finite Difference Time Domain method (FDTD). The antenna was modelled using MoM whereas the head tissues were modelled using FDTD. Two antennas were designed and investigated with respect to the SAR and radiation performance for two different antenna positions on the top edge of mobile handsets. Radiation patterns are presented and compared, with and without the human head, and the maximum SAR values and field distribution inside the human head for both antennas are discussed. The balanced antenna shows good improvements with respect to the unbalanced antenna in terms of the SAR values and variations of the input impedances.","bibo:AuthorList":["Excell, Peter S","Abd-Alhameed, R A","Alias, R","Khalil, K","Mustafa, J"],"dc:date":"2004-11-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1024732,"sim:weight":0.521821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101549,"sim:weight":0.502004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43478,"sim:weight":0.473478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75366,"sim:weight":0.46951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102631,"sim:weight":0.448397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1016552,"sim:weight":0.429213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145575,"sim:weight":0.415316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":819902,"sim:weight":0.384933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1057964,"sim:weight":0.368962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":757004,"sim:weight":0.350773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931533,"sim:weight":0.294738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":950281,"sim:weight":0.288548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393541,"sim:weight":0.288025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":874785,"sim:weight":0.282765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386889,"sim:weight":0.26949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145893,"sim:weight":0.266361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383914,"sim:weight":0.241887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387050,"sim:weight":0.2305,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710610,"sim:weight":0.222789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58493,"sim:weight":0.200574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A significant difference was reported: successful candidates were more open in terms of feelings, actions and values. This result establishes that interviewing is differentiating between candidates in terms of the personality dimension of openness.

This article reflects upon the nature, context and format of the online learning environment, explores the staff and student experience of participating and engaging in the conference, and considers its effectiveness for learning and teaching. The article also highlights some of the cross cultural insights that emerged concerning language, culture, and social context in respect of the issue of racism and related issues of discrimination. The creation of a virtual learning environment across three continents raised interesting challenges and exciting opportunities in respect of academic collaboration and the development of learning and teaching strategies. The article concludes by suggesting that there is pedagogical merit in using both cross cultural and virtual learning environments which may be particularly well suited to enable students to grapple with subject matters that have historically been fraught with ignorance, prejudice and pre-conceived ideas.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buchanan, Julian","Wilson, S T","Gopal, N"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.468217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.465407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.435268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.41374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.412766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.410941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.409718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.40887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104691,"sim:weight":0.396966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.390435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.372614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104851,"sim:weight":0.371783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16185,"sim:weight":0.365596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664559,"sim:weight":0.353852,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1128,"sim:weight":0.349219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":78564,"sim:weight":0.348007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104018,"sim:weight":0.347618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709519,"sim:weight":0.347454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.320299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9631121,"sim:weight":0.314258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the social, occupational and psychological benefits from mobile telephony motivate them to use and appropriate it through inventive use and adaptation.\nResearch limitations/implications – The findings suggest that current understanding of usability needs to be interwoven with that about the appropriation of technology in order to develop a better understanding of the use and consequent integration of a technology in daily lives.\nPractical implications – The paper adds to the argument for a bottom-up approach for ICT-enabled intervention in development activities and for the mobile telephony manufacturers and network providers it contributes to understanding of the rural consumer market of a developing country.\nOriginality/value – The paper presents an original conceptual diagram that combines the concept of usability and appropriation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dey, Bidit Lal","Newman, David R","Pendergast, Renee"],"dc:date":"2011-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":47598,"sim:weight":0.425452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53524,"sim:weight":0.236384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931624,"sim:weight":0.204217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.203647,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.203621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.203427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.187518,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47362,"sim:weight":0.181335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.17778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.17778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.17778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.17778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.17778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.17778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.17778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.17778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.17778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.17778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.17778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.17778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It has been shown that GA and BSA can form soluble and insoluble complexes depending on the solution pH and the mixing ratio and is a function of the net charge on the complex. Soluble complexes were obtained when the electrophoretic mobility was greater than ±1. 5 μm s−1 V−1 cm−1. Changes in the value of the isoelectric point of the complexes with mixing ratio and isothermal titration calorimetric data indicated that complexes formed at pHs 3 and 4 consisted of  60 BSA molecules for every GA molecule, while at pH 5 there were  10 BSA molecules per GA molecule. Calorimetric studies also indicated that the interaction occurred in two stages at both pH 3 and pH 4, but that the nature of the interaction at these two pH values was significantly different. This was attributed to differences in the relative magnitude of the positive and negative charges on the BSA and GA, respectively, and possibly due to changes in the BSA conformation. The fact that there is an interaction at pH 5, which is above the isoelectric point of the BSA, is due to the interaction of the carboxylate groups on the GA with positive patches on the BSA or to the charge regulation of the protein−polysaccharide system brought about by changes in dissociation equilibria. Complexation is reduced as the ionic strength of the solvent increases and is prevented at a NaCl concentration of 120 mM.","bibo:AuthorList":["Vinayahan, T","Williams, Peter A","Phillips, G O"],"dc:date":"2010-11-01","doi":"10.1021/bm100486p","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":101368,"sim:weight":0.379724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75488,"sim:weight":0.298395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99447,"sim:weight":0.296605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102697,"sim:weight":0.266545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99449,"sim:weight":0.262146,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98877,"sim:weight":0.256739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":485440,"sim:weight":0.256578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1650745,"sim:weight":0.241407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386663,"sim:weight":0.207228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44620,"sim:weight":0.188467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387390,"sim:weight":0.181992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710555,"sim:weight":0.180086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101411,"sim:weight":0.178349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652822,"sim:weight":0.177892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710041,"sim:weight":0.169724,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387366,"sim:weight":0.165909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145166,"sim:weight":0.162432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":777776,"sim:weight":0.156406,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26589,"sim:weight":0.155945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387413,"sim:weight":0.147094,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The drawback of DCG is its low sensitivity and limited spectral response. Silver halide materials can be processed in such a way that the final hologram will have properties like a DCG hologram. Recently this technique has become more interesting since the introduction of new ultra-high-resolution silver halide emulsions. An optimized processing technique for transmission HOE’s recorded in these materials is introduced. Diffraction efficiencies over 90% can be obtained for transmissive diffraction gratings. Understanding the importance of the selective hardening process has made it possible to obtain results similar to conventional DCG processing. The main advantage of the SHSG process is that high-sensitivity recording can be performed with laser wavelengths anywhere within the visible spectrum. This simplifies the manufacturing of high-quality, large-format HOE’s.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kim, J M","Choi, B S","Kim, S I","Bjelkhagen, H I","Phillips, N J"],"dc:date":"2001-01-01","doi":"10.1364/AO.40.000622","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1393511,"sim:weight":0.239137,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1353390,"sim:weight":0.228955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385766,"sim:weight":0.228754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1057682,"sim:weight":0.197986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387681,"sim:weight":0.194617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65894,"sim:weight":0.179948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1393510,"sim:weight":0.158499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":271226,"sim:weight":0.151591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26743,"sim:weight":0.137645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66154,"sim:weight":0.133979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101302,"sim:weight":0.129021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44673,"sim:weight":0.127455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46104,"sim:weight":0.126963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98680,"sim:weight":0.126087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98706,"sim:weight":0.126011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2081544,"sim:weight":0.12334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106939,"sim:weight":0.117555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512823,"sim:weight":0.114713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106968,"sim:weight":0.112648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98575,"sim:weight":0.110048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Drawing on Rice’s (2003) distinction between classic paranormal beliefs and religious paranormal beliefs, the present study proposed a modified form of the Tobacyk Revised Paranormal Belief Scale to produce separate scores for these two forms of paranormal belief, styled ‘religious paranormal beliefs’ and ‘classic paranormal beliefs’. Data provided by a sample of 143 undergraduate students in Northern Ireland and Wales, who completed the Francis Scale of Attitude toward Christianity alongside the Tobacyk Revised Paranormal Belief Scale, demonstrated that conventional religiosity is positively correlated with religious paranormal beliefs, but independent of classic paranormal beliefs. These findings provide a clear framework within which previous conflicting evidence can be interpreted. It is recommended that future research should distinguish clearly between these two forms of paranormal beliefs and that the Tobacyk Revised Paranormal Beliefs Scale should be routinely modified to detach the four religious paranormal belief items from the total scale score.","bibo:AuthorList":["Williams, E","Francis, L","Lewis, Christopher A"],"dc:date":"2009-01-01","doi":"10.1163/008467209X12499946199605","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46724,"sim:weight":0.691819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46792,"sim:weight":0.60857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46721,"sim:weight":0.576866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46725,"sim:weight":0.558179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46697,"sim:weight":0.460371,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47326,"sim:weight":0.454344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46784,"sim:weight":0.452468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46802,"sim:weight":0.188903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46793,"sim:weight":0.159056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26084,"sim:weight":0.145249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383662,"sim:weight":0.142891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43682,"sim:weight":0.14281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23221,"sim:weight":0.142677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46803,"sim:weight":0.140704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47290,"sim:weight":0.139721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24904,"sim:weight":0.137926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99200,"sim:weight":0.13685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46475,"sim:weight":0.129704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44727,"sim:weight":0.129423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1388461,"sim:weight":0.127123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here I take a bolder perspec- tive arguing that in order to understand and appreciate what a community of inquiry is, how it operates, and its influence in the schools, one ought to look at applications of CI that are not within the Philosophy for Children literature.

{"identifier":388684,"ep:Repository":49,"dc:type":["text"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Enterprise Education in Schools and the role of Competency Frameworks","bibo:abstract":"Purpose – The period 2002-2010 has seen significant growth in enterprise education in schools in England, accompanied by the growth of guidelines and frameworks to provide educational and assessment structures. This paper intends to explore the questions: What does “enterprise” mean in the context of 14-19 education? What is the purpose and contribution of competence frameworks and related structures for the learning and assessment of enterprise education? How effective are they? and How might enterprise education frameworks evolve in response to changes in the post- recessionary economic, employment and educational landscape?\nDesign/methodology/approach – The paper conducts a critical review of competency frameworks introduced in England to assist with enterprise education primarily for the 14-19 age group. These are compared on the basis of their educational purpose and rationale (“why?”), their content (“what skills and knowledge they include”), and the approaches to teaching, learning and assessment they recommend (“how?”).\nFindings – The analysis discusses the following questions to reflect on the progress and direction of enterprise education: How broadly or narrowly should enterprise be defined? How useful is the term? Are the skills and related knowledge and attributes too broad or too soft?; and Is there too much emphasis on assessable outcomes, rather than on how enterprising learning takes place?\nPractical implications – The paper contributes to the development of enterprise education for researchers, policymakers and practitioners in schools at an important point in the economic, educational and political cycle.\nOriginality/value – Enterprise education in schools requires critique of and reflection on what has been achieved, together with consideration of its future purpose, value, orientation and nature. There is a concern that the “delivery” of enterprise education takes place in ways which are not “enterprising” forms of learning, and that assessment drives the curriculum. Changes to definitions, frameworks and pedagogy are needed to clarify its future educational role.","bibo:AuthorList":["Draycott, Matthew","Rae, David"],"dc:date":"2011-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1645884,"sim:weight":0.656263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.399317,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.342069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.338198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81717,"sim:weight":0.332869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52213,"sim:weight":0.323296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101495,"sim:weight":0.312504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47157,"sim:weight":0.309469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2837,"sim:weight":0.309011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.308506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46984,"sim:weight":0.307947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.306613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.302382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387169,"sim:weight":0.301925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.2991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57352,"sim:weight":0.296481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.295474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.292533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48240,"sim:weight":0.288029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27452,"sim:weight":0.285331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Initially conceptual, the artworks explore the graphics of line/colour/form with the poetic relationship between human perception and cultural conditioning represented in the concept of the horizon.\nHaywood is fascinated by environments and horizons that evidence obscured history and traces of colours, weathered by natural process and human interaction. His work represents a location, a time and an interaction with an environment, through chromatic ingredients that infuse the palette of the landscape, which he then edits to a limited key of colours. Currently, using lens based media, he selects colour on the horizon, which is then filtered to merge tone into an overall sense of colour, confused by distance and a lack of focus (Train/Window/Industrial Landscapes series). Heald elaborates timelines and choreography for the camera, transforming everyday movements into dance-like passages with the assistance of the slow-motion effects, reminiscent of Haywood’s Train series, which depict the dancing lines of the horizon. The slowing down of Heald’s film, references poetics and time, recognising Kristeva‘s writings, on time (1979) and the semiotic chora (1974). Liggett’s, paints surfaces with veils/layers and gestural brush marks. The depiction of geographical barriers including horizons, create, metaphors for weathering/ageing/movement/time/creative or psychological barriers.\nLiggetts repetitive horizontal line paintings (Sea series, First/Second/Third Attempt) formulate a working method inducing a meditative inspirational state. Oblivious to time during creative insights, Liggett sees this as akin to losing track of western linear time and being lost in the horizon that is the body. In The Dream Space Heald slept in Japanese ‘capsule’ hotels/ryokans/Buddhist temples, accessing simultaneous timelines/zones, capturing the transient/surreal nature of dreams. These performances encapsulated, through colour and movement, an ‘in–between-ness’ that relates to the chora. Heald and Liggett will explore cyclical and monumental time through ideas relating to ‘eternity’ or ‘transcendence’ exploring the horizon of the body/aura through painting and film.\nWithin their presentation the artists will discuss, the differences/similarities between horizons/timelines within their work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Haywood, Paul","Heald, Karen","Liggett, Susan"],"dc:date":"2009-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1664608,"sim:weight":0.250618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45649,"sim:weight":0.217505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634704,"sim:weight":0.21528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.209581,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105058,"sim:weight":0.208701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101205,"sim:weight":0.204418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.202812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145943,"sim:weight":0.197071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101399,"sim:weight":0.194421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.193582,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44987,"sim:weight":0.192498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634513,"sim:weight":0.192407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46627,"sim:weight":0.19229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48370,"sim:weight":0.190809,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101626,"sim:weight":0.188955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.188825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.185889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101195,"sim:weight":0.18498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145866,"sim:weight":0.182612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98899,"sim:weight":0.181255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":388692,"ep:Repository":49,"dc:type":["text"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Visualising the Invisible’: Arts and Science Collaboration","bibo:abstract":"This research explores, psychoanalyst/linguist/philosopher, Julia Kristeva’s concept that female subjectivity seems linked to both cyclical time (menstruation/pregnancy/repetition) and monumental time in sense of eternity (motherhood/reproduction/genetic chain). Whilst also investigating ‘psychological resonance,’ a particular part of the creative process that conjures up the idea of movement between something experienced (object) and it’s impact on the individual (subject). Heald and Liggett are developing ideas relating to a ‘space’ an ‘in-between-ness’ and ‘cyclical time’ from an art/science perspective. Heald began exploring Kristeva’s notion of the semiotic chora as a preverbal space that relates to rhythms, colours and trace, the preverbal infant, the depressive and the psychotic. She became interested in the aspect of the unconscious/subconcious, through working with the patients, exploring maternal/cyclical/monumental time, poetics and the chora. Through ‘dream films’ she creates ambient environments, where the audience is unsure as to whether one is asleep/awake, or even in a state of ‘in-between-ness’. Liggett found ‘in-between-ness’ relates to the stage in the creative process where the artists in her research could not articulate in words exactly what they were intending in their work. The dream state described as occupying ‘in-between-ness’ could also be akin to ‘psychological resonance’, the movement between ‘sites\u0027 or \u0027states of being\u0027, that exists, but are intangible and difficult to articulate. Exploring Winnicott (1994) and Witkin (1974) Liggett suggests that there are three areas of related experience, the subjective, the objective and what Winnicott calls \u0027potential space\u0027. This \u0027potential space\u0027 Liggett sees as having similarities to ‘in-between-ness’. Heald and Liggetts work at the hospital only enabled the artist’s access to patients who are on/adjusting to medication. Building upon the work being completed at the psychiatric unit and in collaboration with Dr Richard Tranter, consultant psychiatrist, Prof. Rob Poole, Professor of Mental Health and GP surgeries, Heald and Liggett are proposing new perspectives into the effects of anti-depressant medications. Scientists know that antidepressants subtly alter the way people perceive emotional stimuli around them, altering people’s social behaviour’s, on a level that people are not consciously aware of. Through arts/science research the collaborators are interested to explore if patient changes are reflected in the way people express themselves and respond to their environment, prior, during and post antidepressant medication. The collaborative arts/science practice will explore these interests through creative, patient lead, artistic expressions of change alongside conventional, reductionist measures of changing depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory) producing sophisticated fusions of art/science.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heald, Karen","Liggett, Susan","Tranter, Richard","Poole, Rob"],"dc:date":"2010-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":105058,"sim:weight":0.269179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98489,"sim:weight":0.260743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386227,"sim:weight":0.230916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.227805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101406,"sim:weight":0.219024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1634681,"sim:weight":0.21553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47264,"sim:weight":0.215457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.213771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101183,"sim:weight":0.212617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3179,"sim:weight":0.211259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145943,"sim:weight":0.209079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101461,"sim:weight":0.205897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58983,"sim:weight":0.204851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.200201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52987,"sim:weight":0.199669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101445,"sim:weight":0.198048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43856,"sim:weight":0.195608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381940,"sim:weight":0.192529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101399,"sim:weight":0.189944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352208,"sim:weight":0.189617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The nature and historical emergence of theological disciplines are considered and related to the social science methods found in van der Ven’s account of empirical theology. Such social science methods are congruent with those used in natural sciences and therefore in natural theology.  Empirical theology may be variously located within the whole enterprise of theology. Yet, it belongs in the theological fold by virtue of its relation to natural theology and through the historical trajectory by which the subdisciplines of theology have come into being.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kay, William K"],"dc:date":"2003-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":73117,"sim:weight":0.360619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43984,"sim:weight":0.310157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631105,"sim:weight":0.2702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75729,"sim:weight":0.214227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98928,"sim:weight":0.213926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77397,"sim:weight":0.204143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99130,"sim:weight":0.182431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43825,"sim:weight":0.178354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99106,"sim:weight":0.169445,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43943,"sim:weight":0.168907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43683,"sim:weight":0.156806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43493,"sim:weight":0.155468,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75732,"sim:weight":0.139372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43701,"sim:weight":0.134609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145162,"sim:weight":0.13256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44230,"sim:weight":0.119548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387215,"sim:weight":0.115361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99509,"sim:weight":0.110206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386225,"sim:weight":0.103362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43653,"sim:weight":0.101152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

But he did believe history could be written by looking at the situations historical figures found themselves in and the problems they attempted to solve.  Pentecostal historiography has been divided into four main types: the providential, the historical roots, the multicultural and the functional.  When each of these types is analysed and judged against Popper’s strictures against induction, we find, among other things, that the unfashionable providential account need not be ruled out.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kay, William K"],"dc:date":"2010-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":971368,"sim:weight":0.438744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88143,"sim:weight":0.372785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99943,"sim:weight":0.266485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77318,"sim:weight":0.212762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76403,"sim:weight":0.207023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930163,"sim:weight":0.193758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44865,"sim:weight":0.188302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86312,"sim:weight":0.178486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383927,"sim:weight":0.177289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47316,"sim:weight":0.176898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46201,"sim:weight":0.162989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103044,"sim:weight":0.159919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352224,"sim:weight":0.15966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.156511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43973,"sim:weight":0.145334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":73892,"sim:weight":0.144294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43181,"sim:weight":0.14173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386225,"sim:weight":0.140358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387215,"sim:weight":0.139269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43493,"sim:weight":0.133865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Technically, the attitude towards Europe acts as the dependent variable whereas the remaining concepts are used as independent variables. The empirical results show Turkish and Polish adolescents are more critical of Europe than adolescents living in “old” Europe. Furthermore, the data show that those who have negative expectations about their personal futures and follow a more traditional religious world view are likely also to be Eurosceptical.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ziebertz, H-G","Kay, William K"],"dc:date":"2008-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43682,"sim:weight":0.336929,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":838736,"sim:weight":0.309696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387272,"sim:weight":0.280665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101374,"sim:weight":0.280131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383571,"sim:weight":0.262485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26084,"sim:weight":0.256096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633037,"sim:weight":0.233598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99200,"sim:weight":0.232024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44728,"sim:weight":0.222957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145887,"sim:weight":0.219934,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101605,"sim:weight":0.208152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46814,"sim:weight":0.207997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46559,"sim:weight":0.207992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43683,"sim:weight":0.203257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.200138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633039,"sim:weight":0.194658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48400,"sim:weight":0.19263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101247,"sim:weight":0.189428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383682,"sim:weight":0.18939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":838668,"sim:weight":0.188921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It begins with the early work of Ninian Smart who made comparisons between the methods used by the sciences and the methods used by religion and showed possible compatibilities.  Elmer Thiessen discussed the thorny issue of indoctrination and exempted religious education from the charges made against it, in part because the criteria for defining indoctrination do not work in this case.  Thomas Groome offered a shared praxis approach, allowing pupils and teachers to dialogue in a search for knowledge.  The Humanist contribution defined religion in a reductionist way and sought to influence debate in England and Wales. Andrew Wright argue that children need to be equipped with the tools of religious literacy, and then to explore religion for themselves.  The chapter ends with an assessment of these different contributions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kay, William K"],"dc:date":"2006-01-01","doi":"10.1007/1-4020-5246-4_40","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1387272,"sim:weight":0.392551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46559,"sim:weight":0.326666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50296,"sim:weight":0.319863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44144,"sim:weight":0.314697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43656,"sim:weight":0.298936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48422,"sim:weight":0.293327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46562,"sim:weight":0.288854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46814,"sim:weight":0.265722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383682,"sim:weight":0.260232,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145621,"sim:weight":0.256903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46772,"sim:weight":0.250699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61043,"sim:weight":0.244576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101496,"sim:weight":0.240107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3211,"sim:weight":0.237194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.235552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.235073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.232562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48367,"sim:weight":0.229382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.227995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48401,"sim:weight":0.224354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The eventual variations between the denominations are partly doctrinal and partly administrative, and these differences depend upon factors that lie outside Sunderland.

Its leader, Karl Fix, bravely offered Hitler resistance.\nNeither the ban on public gatherings issued in 1934, nor the permanent control by the GESTAPO could quench the burning zeal of the new converts. In 1934, many more than 1,000 participants were counted in the services; many of them experienced miraculous healings.\nThrough his literature mission, Fix was able to distribute around two million tracts in more than 12 countries. Thus the movement rapidly spread beyond the German borders. Encouraged by his prophetic view, Fix frankly warned the people of the self-proclaimed “Fuehrer”.\nThe Swiss historian Walter Hollenweger, whose standard work Enthusiastisches Christentum - Die Pfingstbewegung in Geschichte und Gegenwart published in 1969, which, in its translation of 1997, was entitled Pentecostalism Origins and Developments Worldwide, merely mentions the Volksmission in a marginal note without dealing with its historical significance.\nThis article, after giving a short survey of how the German Pentecostal Movement came into being, points out the contribution of the Volksmission, focusing on its establishment over the years between 1933 and 1945.

Starting as a revivalistic and renewal movement within Christianity, it encircled the globe in less than 25 years and grew in North America and then in those parts of the world with the highest birth-rates. Characterised by speaking in tongues, miracles, television evangelism and megachurches, it is also noted for its small-group meetings, empowerment of individuals, liberation of women and humanitarian concerns.\nWithout the financial and military support of the state (as was the case with communism), it flourished in almost every conceivable socio-political environment. Even in Europe, where religion most frequently appeared tired and out of date, Pentecostalism might draw large crowds or, within mainline Christian congregations, flourish in a more muted charismatic form. When these two forms are added together, Pentecostalism and neo-Pentecostalism are thought to account for around 450 million people.\nWilliam K Kay outlines the origins and growth of Pentecostalism, looking at not only the theological aspects of the movement, but also the sociological influences of its political and humanitarian viewpoints.\nReadership: Students of theology and religion, general readers interested in religion and spirituality, and religious professionals who want a concise overview of pentecostalism","bibo:AuthorList":["Kay, William K"],"dc:date":"2011-01-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":77318,"sim:weight":0.410139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77168,"sim:weight":0.317058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631676,"sim:weight":0.263239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43943,"sim:weight":0.257542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76403,"sim:weight":0.255781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76364,"sim:weight":0.239822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75729,"sim:weight":0.222721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18155,"sim:weight":0.201246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633007,"sim:weight":0.200124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43683,"sim:weight":0.194925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631540,"sim:weight":0.190428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77897,"sim:weight":0.184122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383682,"sim:weight":0.182436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383465,"sim:weight":0.180086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385528,"sim:weight":0.175785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929823,"sim:weight":0.16608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2789290,"sim:weight":0.156858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66669,"sim:weight":0.15531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44140,"sim:weight":0.152271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43833,"sim:weight":0.151532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Both artists have exhibited their work nationally and internationally, last showing together in a joint exhibition in Shanghai in 2006. ‘Distance’, comprising assemblages and collages, photographs and drawings, is the result of their continuing long-distance artistic conversation.\nThe presentation of the fragmented work and the presence of dilapidation is tangible in much of their artistic practice. However much of this work focuses on the positive aspects of ruin – on a thing that might be coming into being as opposed to be left to decay. There is evidence of a preoccupation with cutting, placing, re-cutting and re-placing, joining and unjoining, in the collages/assemblages and one look inside either artist’s workshops would reveal an almost neurotic disruption of the ‘outcome’ – telescoping between making and un-making. Could the ‘works’ themselves be ruins – failing in a way to remain intact?\nAny reading of the ‘complete picture’ is disrupted and we are afforded only partial, distanced view - the artwork/viewer/location relationship is interrupted through a provisionalised engagement - meaning and function are unstable. The pre-occupation with fragmentation and the temporary artwork; cutting and rejoining; doing and un-doing; building and un-building, are attempts to reveal ‘spaces of potential’ – perhaps to prise open and invite occupation of the ‘joins’ or gaps themselves.\nAvenue Gallery is located in The University of Northampton’s Avenue Campus on St. George’s Avenue, Northampton NN2 6JD.

Although the synthesis of nanowires has been highly developed, their manipulation into specific device structures has lagged behind. Here we report a simple room temperature method for creating directly patterned structures out of nickel nanowires of submicron diameters as previously formed by electrotemplating. Specially shaped magnetic pole-pieces are used to form patterns of these ferromagnetic rods on thin flexible plastic foils, which were then fixed permanently into place either by electrodepositing an additional thin nickel coating or by a UV-curable polymer solution. It is shown that it is possible with oriented and patterned magnetic fields to create both vertically and, by using additional surface tension forces upon drying, horizontally aligned arrays of nickel rods. The authors show that linewidths down to 50 μm can easily be realized with this technique and also show that direct printing of these magnetophoretically assembled structures onto adhesive or rubber substrates is also possible. The simplicity and low-cost inherent in this lithography-free method suggests that it is suitable as a general manufacturing method for nanowire assembly. As an example, a simple field emission display device is demonstrated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wright, Andrew C","Faulkner, Michael"],"dc:date":"2012-03-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":26706,"sim:weight":0.251497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85757,"sim:weight":0.224219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109133,"sim:weight":0.209278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26735,"sim:weight":0.196245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108948,"sim:weight":0.156914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22904,"sim:weight":0.152961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26653,"sim:weight":0.146159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26353,"sim:weight":0.144147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85213,"sim:weight":0.136039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.134365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26603,"sim:weight":0.126045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84804,"sim:weight":0.124779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26063,"sim:weight":0.105702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Because of working in abortion care some staff expressed a sense of isolation from other colleagues. They said that those who didn’t work in abortion care considered it an unpopular job and perceived patients requesting abortion as more ‘challenging ‘and ‘problematic’ than other patients, partly because of the additional time required but also because of the emotional investment which is associated with the role. Staff’s sense of isolation was manifested because they felt they couldn’t talk to others about their job. Irrespective of their perceived sense of isolation the desire to provide a service for women in need was a motivational factor for those staff who had chosen to work in this area.\nAlthough staff, said personal opinions did not have a place in the delivery of care some were unable to disassociate themselves professionally from their own deeply held personal convictions. In addition, some said that they felt unable to voice opposition to an expectation that they would work in this area if it was included as part of a wider women’s health remit. They indicated that sometimes their feelings were compromised by this aspect of the role indicating they felt unable to exercise their right to conscientious objection.\nThe subject of repeat abortion provoked particularly negative staff emotions for personal and professional reasons, especially if patients repeatedly accessed abortion services because of non use of contraception. Often staff admitted they wanted to ‘lecture’ patients about the issue and some implied that eventually patients may be less likely to receive good care in these instances. However staff reported that women who requested abortion for foetal abnormality were likely to receive more sympathy, understanding and care.\nThe practical challenges mainly concerned whether facilities were appropriate, available and accessible for patient care. Staff recommended that facilities ideally shouldn’t be sited near ante-natal or post-natal areas and there should be provision locally for late gestation abortion and swift access.","bibo:AuthorList":["Astbury-Ward, Edna M"],"dc:date":"2010-10-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.290312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340680,"sim:weight":0.285049,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1649312,"sim:weight":0.281288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56587,"sim:weight":0.269312,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58696,"sim:weight":0.268739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108819,"sim:weight":0.262579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70031,"sim:weight":0.256433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99919,"sim:weight":0.238183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109025,"sim:weight":0.234681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108373,"sim:weight":0.228345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.222103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654845,"sim:weight":0.204915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56635,"sim:weight":0.204136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.197714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56557,"sim:weight":0.197497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The conventionally performed tests show that the calculated interfacial shear strength for this system is approximately 16 MPa regardless of the position of the supporting knife edges. The strain distribution along the fibre during simulated microbond tests was studied as a function of knife edge position, interfacial area and level of load by means of Raman spectroscopy. It was found that the interfacial shear stress was not constant, as is frequently assumed, but was strongly dependent upon distance through the droplet, knife-edge position and applied load. At low loads the strain was a maximum at the point where the fibre entered the droplet and then dropped off sharply through the embedded length. This effect was enhanced when the knife-edge separation was reduced. The variation of the shape of the stress distribution was similar to that predicted by a linear finite element analysis. At higher load levels the onset of failure in the region closest to the point where the fibre entered the droplet could be observed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Day, Richard","Cauich Rodrigez, J V"],"dc:date":"1998-12-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24920,"sim:weight":0.312163,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24925,"sim:weight":0.29419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24739,"sim:weight":0.288335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25770,"sim:weight":0.278762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27903,"sim:weight":0.249816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24918,"sim:weight":0.247135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512836,"sim:weight":0.227394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26001,"sim:weight":0.222032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27120,"sim:weight":0.185412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The FDRP was developed as a child centred intervention aimed at resolving disputes involving children, without recourse to the courts. When parents separate children have a right to contact with both parents. Seeking effective methods to enable parental communication and cooperation is important for the positive welfare of the child/children concerned. The process of enduring parental conflict not only marginalises the rights of the right but places children at risk of harm. There is a widespread understanding that such disputes are not always helped by engagement in the adversarial court process. The earlier and quicker that parents cooperatively engage in out-of-court dispute resolution processes the better. There are currently a diverse range of conciliation, mediation and dispute resolution schemes operating throughout Wales and England. These schemes vary in terms of philosophy, methods, focus, time, court involvement and process. The effectiveness of these schemes is generally not known as relatively few programmes have been independently evaluated. This evaluation of the CAFCASS Cymru’s Family Dispute Resolution Pilot Programme (FDRP) in North Wales comprised postal questionnaires for parents and qualitative interviews with a sample of parents, children and professionals engaging with the programme.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buchanan, Julian","Parry, Odette","Pithouse, Andrew","Warren, Emily","Ifans, Jonquil"],"dc:date":"2007-07-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2745839,"sim:weight":0.327585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The study involved 27 participants interacting with the user interface. Their behaviour was observed and recorded, and their interaction with the system was analysed. They were also given a post-session questionnaire, where their opinions of the usability of the interface were solicited. The results of the usability testing were positive, and insight has been gained into how products of this nature can be further improved.

This article discusses the implications of findings from a questionnaire survey of 41 schools of nursing in the UK regarding their provision of training in human sexuality. Schools of nursing were chosen, as nurses form by far the largest employment group in the NHS today. The aim of this questionnaire survey was to obtain information on the provision of training in human sexuality in schools of nursing in the UK. The 20-item mixed qualitative and quantitative questionnaire was designed to elicit maximum information about research questions, it was independently validated after focus group discussion. The results drawn from this study will be primarily presented as observations, rather than statistically tested statements. The provision of training in human sexuality in the pre-registration nursing curricula in the UK is inadequate to meet the current varied needs of patients. On average, a mere 6.8 hours out of a potential 2300 hours of theoretical learning is dedicated to teaching human sexuality in schools of health in the UK. This is considerably less time than is dedicated to other areas of learning within the curriculum. The overall provision of training in human sexuality in the nursing curricula does not seem to have significantly improved, regardless of pleas from such esteemed bodies as the World Health Organisation and others.","bibo:AuthorList":["Astbury-Ward, Edna M"],"dc:date":"2011-11-01","doi":"10.1080/14681994.2011.618180","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5224498,"sim:weight":0.388925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54706,"sim:weight":0.339111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25774,"sim:weight":0.312098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999821,"sim:weight":0.287223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58866,"sim:weight":0.254803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58696,"sim:weight":0.252619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57328,"sim:weight":0.247607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108284,"sim:weight":0.246643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53596,"sim:weight":0.208482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26615,"sim:weight":0.1885,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108975,"sim:weight":0.183061,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24009,"sim:weight":0.175319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1512474,"sim:weight":0.137311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The LES results have demonstrated that the internally spout-fluidised bed with draft tube and disk-baffle can remarkably improve its hydrody-namic behaviour, which can effectively disperse fibre bundles and promote pre-impregnation with resin powder in manufacturing fibre reinforced thermoplastics. The hydrodynamics of the spout-fluidised bed has been investigated and reported in a previous paper (Hosseini et al., 2009). This study attempts to reveal important features of fibre dispersion and correlations between the fibre disper-sion and the characteristics of turbulence in the internally spout-fluidised bed using the LES modelling, focusing on the likely hydro-dynamic impact on fibre dispersion. The simulation has clearly indicated that there exists a strong interaction between the turbulent shear flow and transported fibres in the spout-fluidised bed. Fibre entrainment is strongly correlated with the local vorticity distribu-tion. The dispersion of fibres was modelled by a species transport equation in the LES simulation. The turbulent kinetic energy, Rey-nolds stress and strain rate were obtained by statistical analysis of the LES results. The LES results also clearly show that addition of the internals in the spout-fluidised bed can significantly change the turbulent flow features and local vorticity distribution, enhancing the capacity and efficiency of fibre flocs dispersion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yang, Xiaogang","Huang, Xiaobing","Zong, Yuan","Dai, Grance"],"dc:date":"2012-06-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":24911,"sim:weight":0.12282,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":24739,"sim:weight":0.113854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27655,"sim:weight":0.0701328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
