These networks, which organised the private trade of British civilians and military personnel in India, linked the export and import economies of Bengal, Madras, Java, the Philippines, the Malay peninsula and southern China, and came to dominate much of the regional trade of the Indian Ocean, as well as its links to Europe.  Many of those engaged in this activity were Scots, and the connections between them - based in part on kinship - provided the institutional setting for the remittance of private money from Asia to Europe.  While the activities of the East India Company provided an important part of the setting for these activities, much of them also depended on private enterprise and non-official networks.  As a result, the volume of capital remitted from Bengal to Britain during the 1790s and 1800s was much larger than has previously been estimated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tomlinson, Tom"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Since then, the School has changed dramatically in nature and scope; and the Library, with its supporting role, has adjusted to fit. Most obvious, but core, changes have related to student numbers, leading to radically different teaching and learning methods, and to the range and type of courses offered.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in recent years, SOAS Library has faced many new challenges. Librarians\u0027 basic professional skills of cataloguing and classification, and now acquisition, are ones that we are relearning, on-line. The rapid development of the internet in terms both of international databases of primary and secondary source material and of remote library resources, has created what are, to many librarians worldwide, still uncharted oceans of information. More efficient and effective publishing industries in a number of African countries have created greater awareness of what material is available - if not always greater success in acquiring it. Networks of dedicated information specialists, north and south, on both sides of the Atlantic, have striven to use modern tools and ease of communications to enable both knowledge of and access to documentation in a range of subjects and regions. Not least, massive political, social and economic upheavals in African countries from Ethiopia to South Africa, Rwanda to Sierra Leone, have had their repurcussions throughout the information world as universities and libraries close and open, archival collections long in exile relocate to countries suddenly made safe for them, publishing industries (both state- and private-sector) cease to function and then revive ...\r\n\r\nHere in the UK, as in Europe, as in America, co-operation is the name of the game - by librarians and information specialists, by libraries and their parent institutions, by publishers and booksellers, increasingly with government encouragement to pool resources and share access.\r\n\r\nLittle wonder, then, in the face of all that is happening around us, that we are learning to feel our way along a myriad different routes to a faster, better, more aware and responsive service for an ever-expanding, discerning and demanding higher education community. It is in this context that my paper will set SOAS Library and the brave new world it seeks to explore and interpret for its students and other scholars.","bibo:AuthorList":["Turfan , Barbara"],"dc:date":"2001","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8933664,"sim:weight":0.387966,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.375821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89985,"sim:weight":0.374384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89658,"sim:weight":0.362931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.362507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162458,"sim:weight":0.350539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.347341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4158458,"sim:weight":0.34067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.339785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.337394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154826,"sim:weight":0.337394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.336645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.336645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.336645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.336645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.336645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.336645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.336645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.336645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.336645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The author proposes that contemporary  dance in today’s India can be seen as a continuum, under which is tension and rupture.  It  embraces  on one hand, ‘classicism’- strictly speaking ‘neo-classicism’ -  on the other, an ideological move away from this ‘classicism’, which  constitutes itself into an  heterogeneous movement motivated  by  a  search for  new dance languages.  These new languages,  growing  out of ‘traditional roots’ (variously defined), claim to be sustained by the ‘classicism ’ of Indian dance. This movement can be referred to, for convenience, as ‘post-classicism’; this ‘post-classicism’is otherwise known as  ‘Contemporary’ dance – with a capital c  , in accordance with a western model.  Dance in today’s India, whether ‘classical’ or ‘post-classical’  is wholly entangled with the issue of an Indian religious and secular identity, increasingly dominated by a Hinduising discourse, and this  informs the artistic choices of dance artists. The essay will discuss the work of Ranjabati Sircar, here seen as ‘post-classical’,  against this scenario, and will begin to reflect on the impact Ranjabati Sircar’s choreography  and her cosmopolitanism has had on dance in  contexts other than India, such as the British South Asian diaspora.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lopez y Royo, Alessandra"],"dc:date":"2003-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":2783485,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Book Chapters","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Malayali young men and their movie heroes","bibo:abstract":"Here we bring together masculinities and popular culture to think about how they are configured within the arena of cinema, focusing in on Kerala\u0027s two major male movie stars and the relationship they have with their young male fans. In their relative lack of interest in female stars and turn towards male stars young men are playing out an approach towards gendering which does not take as its foundation hierarchic or compulsory heterosexuality. Young men\u0027s tentative (and illicit, difficult) relationships with young women lack the substance of their relationships with each other and with their male movie heroes. We consider cinema as a forum for collective fantasy which acts as a source of helpful orientations, stars being particular nodes within this arena, dense points of transfer of desire, belief, self-affirmation or transformation and so on. Film audiences receive or subvert cinematic messages and form relationships with stars - whether in fantasy or actually - and with each other, mediated through cinematic modes of being or styles of doing. Another effect of cinema-related activities is to provide adolescent and post-adolescent boys with a safe segregated social space in which they can socialise, share information, try out fledgling masculine identities and grapple with the demands of emerging sexualities. The star makes possible identifications with the self- (for Mohan Lal, one who is working class and in solidarity with the poor, in Mammootty\u0027s case a solidly bourgeoios self); transformations of the self - opportunities through fan association work to distribute largesse like a high-caste wealthy patron; and an extended sense of self - the possiblity that through the fan association one might participate in the star\u0027s power and reach. \r\nIn Kerala, unlike other states, fandom is not a matter of rivalry, political partisanship or even life and death. While there is a \u0027hard-core\u0027 central group who remain partisan and always committed to \u0027their\u0027 star, in general young men frequently shift associations and change allegiances. Yet the two heroes seem to embody different styles of hero and to have different types of appeal to audiences; sociologically, their fan bases trace slightly different social groupings. Mammootty has an affinity with roles implying powerful and high-status men in control, strong in family drama; Mohan Lal is admired for his abilities in romance, song, dance and fighting. One might wish to be like Mammootty but often feels that one already is in some way like Mohan Lal. Despite considerable overlap and dispute, Mammootty and Mohan Lal embody and perform different styles of manliness, none of which one could dispense with in one\u0027s potential repertiore. Both Mammootty and Mohan Lal are necessary in a full fantasy life and a necessarily internally fragmented and shifting gendered identity. Cinema also relates to ethnicity. Mammotty allows young non-Muslim men to experience a fantasy relationship with a powerful mature Muslim man, a community coded \u0027other\u0027 in Kerala. A twist to this is that (similar to analyses of white anglo masculinities and work on the \u0027blackness\u0027 of Elvis) we find working class Hindu masculinity, while explicitly defined in opposition to the Muslim other, at another level actually relies upon an incorporation of aspects of masculinity especially associated in the cultural landscape with Muslimness. In a more mediated and disguised manner, Mohan Lal also plays with elements of fantasy identity culturally coded by young Hindus as \u0027Muslim\u0027.","bibo:AuthorList":["Osella, Caroline","Osella, Filippo","Chopra, Radhika","Osella, Caroline","Osella, Filippo"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

A methodology for the analysis and reconstitution of the dance","bibo:abstract":"This short essay  presents a case study – that of the dance reliefs of the Prambanan complex in Central Java,  aiming  to steer the  discussion around  an important aspect of any archaeological investigation of  dance.  Rather than focusing solely on contextual issues, such as the nature and function of dance at a particular point in time and in a specific socio-cultural context, the Prambanan case study questions  how to engage with the archaeological dance record from a dancer’s  point of view, in other words in terms of movement reconstitution and its re-embodiment.  It is almost tautological to say that dance is practice based and performance oriented. However it is often the case that it is precisely this aspect of dance which is neglected in archaeological accounts and no methodologies are being developed to deal with such issues.  My work on the Prambanan dance reliefs attempts to bridge this gap.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lopez y Royo, Alessandra"],"dc:date":"2003-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":2783488,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Articles","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"\u0027Ayyappan Saranam\u0027: masculinity and the Sabarimala pilgrimage in Kerala","bibo:abstract":"Sabarimala – a South Indian all-male pilgrimage to Ayyappan, a hyper-male deity born from two male gods – plays a role in constructing male identities, at both external (socialstructural) and internal (psychological) levels. The pilgrimage draws creatively on relationships\r\nbetween two South Asian male figures: renouncer and householder, breaking down the opposition between transcendence and immanence to bring into everyday life\r\na sense of transcendence specific to men. This also has masculine and heroic overtones, characterized by ascetic self-denial and pain and by the identification of pilgrims with the deity and his perilous mountain-forest journey. Pilgrimage bestows power as blessings from Ayyappan and as specifically masculine forms of spiritual, moral, and bodily\r\nstrength, while acting as signifier of masculine superior purity and strength and of male responsibilities towards family welfare. Sabarimala merges individual men both with the hyper-masculine deity and with a wider community of men: other male pilgrims, senior male gurus (teachers). This merger is both social and personal. A normal and universal sense of masculine ambivalence and self-doubt has a specific local-cultural resolution, when boys and men experience strengthening of the gendered ego through renunciatory self-immersion in a ‘greater masculine’. The ostensibly egalitarian devotional community is actually hierarchical: pilgrims surrender themselves to deity and guru, while equality and friendship between men can be celebrated and performed precisely because it is predicated upon a deeper sense of difference and hierarchy – gender – with woman as the absent and inferiorized other. Such segregated celebrations of masculinity work both towards masculinity’s reproduction – through processes of ‘remasculinization’ – and in the limiting of masculinity to males.","bibo:AuthorList":["Osella, Filippo","Osella, Caroline"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M R Allen.

Yet the Sthanakavasi tradition has not received any attention by academic scholarship. The present article is the second of a four-part history of the Sthanakavasi tradition, based on textual and ethnographic sources. \r\n\r\nThe first part (BIS 13/14 2000) gave an overview of the history and doctrines of the Sthanakavasi mendicant traditions, from the reforms of Lonka in the 15th century, until the creation of a unified Sramanasangha under the command of a single acarya in 1952. It analysed the aims and structure of Sramanasangha, and the refusal of many Sthanakavasi orders in Gujarat and Rajasthan to join the new organisation. In conclusion, four types of Jainism were distinguished: canonical, traditional, protestant, and post-protestant. The Sthanakavasi tradition is a mixture of protestant and traditional elements. \r\n\r\nPart II investigates the sectarian dynamic within the Sramanasangha in conjunction with the history and structure of the independent Sthanakavasi traditions in Malva. It starts with a critical analysis of the notion of \u002722 schools\u0027 (baistola) of the Dharmadasa tradition, from which most Malva traditions are derived. The analysis of the relationship between the segments of the Dharmadasa traditions inside and outside the Sramanasangha, leads to the identification of three principal variables of Jain monastic organisation: descent, seniority, and succession. These structuring devices are used to mediate between the imperatives of historical legitimation and maintenance of differential group identity. It is argued that the new Sthanakavasi lists of succession (pattavalis), the prime markers of sectarian identity, were constructed retrospectively on the basis of lists of descent (gurvavalis) and biographical poems, not the other way round, as commonly assumed.  \r\n\r\nParts III-IV (forthcoming) describe the Sthanakavasi traditions in the Panjab and Gujarat, and the overall context of Jain politics of religious modernisation in the 19th - 20th centuries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"2003a.

They are much wider-ranging than the 1993 Regulations, which had preceded them: in addition to banks and other financial institutions, which were already covered, and bureaux de change and money transmission offices, added in 2001, they also apply to, inter alia, lawyers, accountants, estate agents, casinos and dealers in high value goods, such as jewellers and art dealers.\r\n\r\nDealers in high value goods, however, are only covered in respect of transactions which are of a value of at least €15,000 and, moreover, in cash.  That customers will be dealt with differently, in respect of the same transaction, depending on how payment is made, is unfortunate.  A threshold stated in sterling would also be preferable: jewellers are often less well used to dealing in other currencies than financial institutions.  More generally, if particular care is seen as required in relation to cash transactions, the threshold should arguably be lower.\r\n\r\nThe actual requirements imposed have, however, changed little: the only major change is that certain types of business now need to be registered with Customs \u0026 Excise.","bibo:AuthorList":["Alexander, R.C.H."],"dc:date":"2004-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Legal research skills are an increasingly important part of students’ studies. It is vital that law graduates are equipped with the necessary skills to research a legal problem adequately to become a competent legal practitioner. As SOAS law students study not only English and EU law, but also the laws of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, they need to be able to develop research skills that enable them to find relevant regional material effectively, accurately and successfully.\r\n\r\nHowever, a number of problems have come to light at SOAS which have initiated a change in the way legal research skills training is currently delivered – including the\r\nissue of student retention, high numbers of international students, diversity of students’ backgrounds and skills, and their different information needs. Thus, an investigation was undertaken into how SOAS can use the capabilities of a VLE to help change the current approach to legal research skills training.\r\n\r\nA questionnaire was delivered to all law students currently studying at SOAS to discover their specific information needs relating to legal research skills. Additionally, an evaluation policy was constructed using previous research and the experience of other institutions, to evaluate two existing legal research skills programmes available in the UK and Australia. The results of this evaluation and questionnaire help to inform\r\nthe construction of the framework.\r\n\r\nThe results provided a general framework for the delivery of legal research skills training to undergraduate students at SOAS. By including the more generic skills as\r\nwell as specific legal research skills, this framework has a wider application and can, therefore, be used, compared and adapted for further research by other institutions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Spells, Sarah"],"dc:date":"2005-12-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"12th BILETA.

The implications of this policy have been a matter of debate in the literature. This paper seeks to provide some useful input into the debate. With a view of investigating into the potential of long-term development of large enterprises, we estimate the “sequential production technology” in computing the Malmquist productivity index for various size-groups of enterprises in Chinese industry. Our findings indicate that large enterprises did register the fastest productivity growth and improvement in technical efficiency in the 1994-97 period. It thus appears that large-scale, mainly state-owned Chinese enterprises have exhibited the potential of making noticeable improvements and the relevant state policy does have its justification.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cheng, Yuk-Shing","Lo, Dic"],"dc:date":"2004-12","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Yuanzheng Cao, Yingyi Qian and Barry R Weingast.

On the basis of some further regression analyses, and drawing on a number of applied studies on the subject matter, the paper argues that the finding is plausible and of complex ramifications.

This paper shows that Naoussa capitalists grasped the opportunities created by trade liberalisation, accumulated capital in domestic manufacture of woollen cloth, and secured a regular supply of low-wage female labour and free hydraulic energy. It is further shown that they took advantage of local institutional and political mechanisms within the Christian community independent of the relatively remote Ottoman state. But there was no capitalist transformation of agriculture, even though Naoussa capitalists often owned large land estates. Lack of broader institutional and political influence and absence of capitalist transformation of agriculture hampered the transformation of Naoussa capitalists from a provincial social group into a broad-based capitalist class.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lapavitsas, Costas"],"dc:date":"2004-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Anastasopoulos.

What is the theoretical underpinning of the demand? And what are the implications of the demand for economic development? The conventional literature known as comparative economic systems has been unable to answer these question, because there is an intrinsic tension between its methodology (the neoclassical framework of individualistic rational choices and their equilibrium) and the subject matter (the multiplicity of economic institutions and development experiences in the real world). The new comparative economics has consisted of a variety of attempts to cope with this tension: some aimed at preserving the neoclassical framework at a more fundamental level, while some others aimed at transcending the framework to arrive at a new theory of economic systems and development. This paper argues that attempts that adhere to the neoclassical tradition is likely to lead to dead ends, while attempts that encompass collective as well as individualistic rationality represent more promising directions. Fuller developments of the literature, however, require incorporating objectified institutions and paradigmised technology into its sphere of inquiry. It is submitted that there are important lessons to learn from classical political economy and their modern presentations, particularly Marxian theories of the social forces of production, in this regard.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lo, Dic"],"dc:date":"2004-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Aoki.

Three main findings come out from the analyses in the paper. First, it is found that FDI tends to promote the improvement in allocative efficiency, while having a negative impact on productive efficiency. Second, insofar as FDI does promote overall productivity growth, this tends to be a matter of cumulative causation rather than one of single-direction causation. Third, in the context of a comparative analysis of two distinctive regional models, it is found that the economic impact of FDI tends to be more favourable in the inward-looking, capital-deepening pattern of development (the ‘Shanghai model’) than that in the export-oriented, labour-intensive pattern (the ‘Guangdong model’). Further analyses, however, suggest that the ‘Shanghai model’ has its intrinsic problems of sustainability. The scope for applying it to China as a whole is thus judged to be limited.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lo, Dic"],"dc:date":"2004-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Aoki. (1996).

In particular the paper seeks to answer three questions. Why was reform launched in 1991 when the real economy was essentially in good condition? Why did the state choose a neo-liberal policy package when other options were available? Why did the state sustain liberalisation even after the economy had recovered from the immediate crisis? Existing answers to these questions are found to be inadequate. Instead this paper focuses on an alternative explanation that emphasises continuity, the reforms in 1991 can be traced back to the early 1970s.

This optimism is based on an unwarranted assumption in cross-country empirical studies. In practise the increasing number of large LDC’s shifting towards export promotion since the 1980s is found to coincide with declining terms of trade for labour-intensive manufactures. So far this decline has been offset by growth in volume. The positive relation is actually dependent on market growth in developed countries rather than domestic policy reform. Marx (the Moor) provides a useful framework in which to analyse this process. His analysis of competition and accumulation within a national economy is transposed to that of international trade. Finally, the increasing integration of capital into ‘value chains’ and the formation of regional trading blocs can be related to the crisis tendencies of competition and the erosion of profit margins.","bibo:AuthorList":["McCartney, Matthew"],"dc:date":"2004-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Amsden.

It states that China’s reformed economic institutions are a mix of market-conforming and market-supplanting elements, that its developmental achievements so far have been ascribable to the conforming elements whereas the accumulated problems being ascribable to the supplanting elements, and that the problems have tended to outweigh the achievements as the country’s economic transition progresses from the allegedly easy phase to the difficult phase. This paper offers an alternative interpretation of the Chinese experience. The central proposition is that China’s economic institutions could be seen in favourable light both theoretically and with reference to the East Asian development experience. Specifically, the developmental implications of the market-conforming and market-supplanting elements should not be understood in any absolute sense, but rather depend on the appropriate match or otherwise between the institutions and the external environment. The developmental achievements to date indicate that China’s economic reform has managed to achieve a basically appropriate match between the two aspects, although enormous uncertainties still cloud over the future prospects owing to changes both in the external environment and the reform strategies of the state leadership.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lo, Dic"],"dc:date":"2003-11","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A H Amsden.

The properties of the new estimates are compared to the existing estimates by the World Bank based on household survey means.  We also use the new estimates to reflect on the recent controversies regarding the relationship between economic growth and poverty reduction.  It is argued that the controversy is mainly due to the lack of distinction between what one can refer to as ‘generalized extreme poverty’ in low-income countries and the more ‘normal’ poverty situations in higher income economies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Karshenas, Massoud"],"dc:date":"2001-11","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Anand and S M R Kanbur.

In market-based systems, in contrast, they tend to undertake short-term lending that requires adequate reserves to guarantee liquidity. Theoretical support for these two approaches to banking can be found in,respectively, Steuart and Smith. The innovative Marxist analysis of banking by Hilferding combined elements of both. Banks in the early stages of development are\r\nSmith-like but, as the scale of fixed investment in industry grows, they lend long-term and become Steuart-like, also developing ‘commitment’ relations with enterprises. However, Hilferding also implied, erroneously, that financial systems historically evolve\r\nin a bank-based direction. Based on Hilferding but also drawing on Japanese Marxist\r\nanalysis of finance, it is suggested instead that bank behaviour in bank-based systems\r\nresults from institutional changes imposed by policy-makers in order to achieve ‘catching\r\nup.’","bibo:AuthorList":["Lapavitsas, Costas"],"dc:date":"2002-11","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"A Brewer.

This is particularly the case from the perspective of\r\nFeminist Economics. Gender biases are reflected in the quantitative data sources and methods commonly applied for economic research. These include male biases in statistical data, a focus on outcomes rather than processes as well as the neglect of reproductive work and its interaction with market work. To overcome these problems, this paper introduces between-method triangulation, i.e. the combination of quantitative and qualitative methods of data generation and analysis, as an innovative and more realistic methodology to conduct gendered economic analysis.\r\nIt draws on the authors’ recent empirical work on the Indonesian and Mauritian labour markets where between-method triangulation was employed. The approach is shown\r\nto be able to enhance empirical economic analysis by mutually validating results. Furthermore, the approach is shown to remove gender biases in economic analysis by\r\nanalysing conflicting evidence and by complementing quantitative with qualitative findings in light of feminist economics theory.","bibo:AuthorList":["Blin, Myriam","Siegmann, Karin Astrid"],"dc:date":"2006-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This growth experience has been\r\nbased mainly on China’s internal dynamics. In the first half of the era, economic growth was propelled by improvement in both allocative efficiency and productive efficiency. From the early 1990s until the present time, however, economic growth has been increasingly based on\r\ndynamic increasing returns associated with a growth path that is characterised by capital deepening. In both periods, the growth paths and their associated long-term-oriented institutions contradict principles of the free market economy – i.e., doctrines of globalisation. In the form of an analytical overview, this article seeks to explain and interpret the historical background, logic of evolution, and developmental and social implications of China’s economic transformation. The analytics draws on a range of relevant economic theories including Marxian theory of economic growth, Post-Keynesian theory of demand\r\ndetermination, and Neo-Schumpeterian theory of innovation. It is posited that these alternative theoretical perspectives offer better insights than mainstream neoclassical economics in explaining and interpreting China’s economic transformation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lo, Dic"],"dc:date":"2006-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2790008,"sim:weight":0.556091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Evidence from three provinces shows that labour markets have a significant impact on the lives of a large number of poor people and that employers exercise considerable discretion in setting wages and conditions of casual, seasonal and permanent wage employment. The evidence presented comes from a combination of a quantitative survey based on purposive sampling with other techniques, including interviews with large farmers. The findings contrast with ideas that rural labour markets are irrelevant to poverty reduction policy formulation in Africa and the paper concludes with methodological, analytical and policy recommendations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sender, John","Oya, Carlos","Cramer, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2006-05","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"C André and J-P Platteau.

This specially inflected tense-aspect form is the one exploited at discourse-level to assert prominent events on the time-axis in foregrounded narrative sequences, but it is also required in classic clause-level wh-constructions, i.e., wh-interrogatives, declarative focus constructions, and relative clauses, operations which often share structural properties across languages. The central claim is that the fronted focus/wh- constructions and pivotal foregrounded portions of past-time narratives utilize the same specialized Perfective tense-aspect morphology because they achieve the same discourse-pragmatic goals—they all supply the most communicatively PROMINENT and focal NEW information.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jaggar, Philip J.","Hyman, Larry M.","Newman, Paul"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2783528,"sim:weight":0.431027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9548362,"sim:weight":0.316263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794754,"sim:weight":0.202681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The paper explores the factors underlying this difference and establishes a significant relationship between labor market participation and female divorce or widowhood. The association is likely to work in both directions. Moreover, contrastive exploration suggests that divorced/separated women differ from non-divorced women in many other important respects: They tend to get access to better jobs; also, divorced and separated mothers are remarkably good at investing in their daughters’ education compared to other mothers and to male respondents. The paper concludes by stressing the limits of regression techniques in teasing out causation and the interactions between variables, and by suggesting that policies to increase female access to decently remunerated wage employment could make a substantial difference to the welfare of very poor rural women in Africa and their children.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sender, John","Oya, Carlos"],"dc:date":"2007-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Farzana Afridi.

We argue that the loss of policy space in many poor SSA countries is associated with donor-recipient relations in aid flows over the past two decades. The influential role of Western donor agencies and the growing marginalisation of SSA countries from international capital flows have left scarce policy space to their governments for more innovative trade, agricultural and industrial policies. The recent New Aid Agenda and the concomitant Western aid harmonization through budget support are likely enhance donors’ influence on policy making and to exacerbate this process despite claims of greater ‘ownership’. Learning from East Asian success stories has been hampered by the unequal bargaining power of SSA governments vis-à-vis their ‘development partners’. More recently, China has started to become an increasingly important player for some SSA countries and Chinese FDI and aid flows are already s significant reality there. Typically these ‘new’ relations may be seen with suspicion by Western ‘development’ partners, but we argue that this (and the cooperation of other Asian governments in a South-South cooperation framework) may be a significant opportunity for some SSA countries to regain part of the policy space lost in the 1980s and 1990s.","bibo:AuthorList":["Oya, Carlos"],"dc:date":"2006-08","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Action Aid.

The initial hypothesis which the thesis establishes in Chapter 1 is that the designation of myth qua myth is neither innocent nor organic; highly consequential interests are at stake when myths are narrated, and, moreover, the categorisation of some types of narrative as ‘myth’ and others as ‘science’, or ‘philosophy’, for example, indicates powerful assertions about their relative level of validity and authority. I argue that these assertions are implicated in discursive strategies of containment and exclusion and allied to forms of identity construction characterised by an assertion of singularity. They further rely on the location of a non-transcendable point of origin as a means of securing the stability and legitimacy of these constructions. I develop this argument, in Chapters 2–7, through an extended case study of the German search for origins from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, and demonstrate its relationship to the German romantic attempt to construct a noble German identity. I critique these forms of identity and origin construction, arguing that the German case is but one example of the western metaphysical theories of ontology which are indebted to inflected patrilinearity, the main feature of which is a preoccupation with monogenetic singularity. I consequently develop an alternative feminist model of origins and identity in Chapters 8–10 based on poststructural and psychoanalytical feminist theories of maternality as a site of splitting, doubling, and process. I acknowledge that while the identification of origins is an ontological convention, the assertion of patrilineal provenance creates forms of subjectivity that are exclusionary, dialectical, and monolithic, and are, therefore, inadequate frameworks for constructing ethically oriented models of identity in a post-feminist context. In contrast, I suggest that metaphors of maternal origin offer a considerably more promising, if transitional, discursive frame for articulating identities that stress multiplicity, connectedness, immanence, and dialogue.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hawthorne, Sian M."],"dc:date":"2006-12-11","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(2000). to “The Maiden Without Hands”","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"to “The Maiden Without Hands”","dc:date":"2000"},{"rawReferenceText":"John Dwyer.

It does so through an examination of the Egyptian state’s neglectful rule, from the 1970s through the 1990s, of its capital Cairo. In particular, the thesis focuses on state inaction vis-à-vis Cairo’s informal housing sector: those neighbourhoods established on land not officially sanctioned for urbanization.\r\n\r\nThe central research question of the thesis is to explain why the Egyptian state has been unable to intervene effectively in these informal neighbourhoods—despite their stigmatization in Egyptian public discourse as threats to the nation’s social, moral and political health; the authoritarian state’s considerable unilateral power; and the availability of western assistance for development interventions. The short answer to the question, is that the very factors which sustain the authoritarian political order constrain the Egyptian state’s ability to intervene in its capital. Neglectful rule is a consequence of the autocratic post-1952 dispensation of power.\r\n\r\nThat this neglect is not simply the result of structural resource constraints, is demonstrated through the examination of donor-funded urban-development projects—aimed at fostering an administratively competent Egyptian state able to intervene in its capital—none of which were successful or sustainable. The failure of these reform initiatives, which could have allowed Egyptian state agencies to upgrade informal Cairo and re-orient its growth, can be plausibly explained in terms of the challenges they posed to the logic of autocratic rule. Thus the reproduction of the informal city is, in part, a consequence of the post-1952 dispensation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dorman, WJ"],"dc:date":"2007-04-30","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(1993).

Recently, however, some new facts have emerged which demonstrate that focus can also occur IN SITU, with a general TAM (Jaggar 2001:496-98; Green \u0026 Jaggar 2003). Hausa in situ wh-questions and focus constructions are especially common with adverbial (especially locative) elements and/or nonverbal predicates and so are more restricted in their distribution than the ex situ strategies, but they represent an interesting new problem which requires extensive study of naturally occurring discourse and detailed syntactic analysis. The Hausa facts also need to be viewed in the wider comparative-historical context of the syntax of in situ focus and wh-constructions in related West Chadic languages.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jaggar, Philip J.","Ibriszimow, Dymitr","Tourneux, Henry","Wolff, Ekkehard H."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2783516,"sim:weight":0.431027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71384,"sim:weight":0.320369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1656150,"sim:weight":0.295557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9548362,"sim:weight":0.26948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43268,"sim:weight":0.264532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661515,"sim:weight":0.25918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108615,"sim:weight":0.250056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81308,"sim:weight":0.245047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108812,"sim:weight":0.240363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17914,"sim:weight":0.229799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108930,"sim:weight":0.227709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99358,"sim:weight":0.224009,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77378,"sim:weight":0.222899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99120,"sim:weight":0.222228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99115,"sim:weight":0.216933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108692,"sim:weight":0.214292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43030,"sim:weight":0.214201,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43098,"sim:weight":0.214127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43501,"sim:weight":0.212995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43312,"sim:weight":0.209704,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Reassessing Priorities for Law Reform","bibo:abstract":"The modern literature on international development in conjunction with the rise of institutional economics has focused attention on the role of institutions in the operation of the economy and crucially on the function of law as setting a framework to market operations. An emerging consensus that views development as a legal in as much as an economic challenge is forcing us to revaluate the relationship between law, regulation, state power and the market. Indeed, the greater the need for law, the larger the role of the state in the economy. The purpose of this article is to enquire into the implications the modern literature on economic development emanating from international institutions (primarily the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund) has for law reform and the role of the state in the economy. The main question asked is whether regulation has a uniform role in all reform contexts or whether there is a difference between the role of law in the transition to a market economy as opposed to the promotion of general development. This article suggests that there is indeed a difference between the role of law in transition as opposed to development that centres on the primacy of the state in the design for reform. While transition, it is suggested, requires a more limited role for law (Washington Consensus), development necessitates a more thorough involvement of the state in the reform process (Post-Washington Consensus). This article offers some preliminary evidence to suggest that a minimal role for regulation focused on market promotion required by ‘transition type’ reforms is adopted across the board and applied indiscriminately to all development scenarios. This means that reform packages remain rather minimal in the involvement of the state and in the scope for law despite the input of institutional economics and the apparent enthusiasm for the promotion of the rule of law. The article concludes that once a distinction is drawn between the different designs needed for transition and development, it becomes evident that a larger role for law and state regulation is needed that goes beyond mere market promotion. The promotion of development which encompasses political, social and economic aspects therefore asks for a wider role for the state.","bibo:AuthorList":["Glinavos, Ioannis"],"dc:date":"2007-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":176915,"sim:weight":0.288732,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":2783533,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Items","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The Design of Free-Market Economies in a Post-Neoclassical World","bibo:abstract":"The ‘Washington Consensus’ supporting competitive frames and market solutions in economics and law was shown inadequate to address social problems in non-U.S. settings. So would diversity and dynamics suggest theories in need of adjustment to other realities such as culture, increasing returns and market power. Reform must account for an economics of falling cost, ecological limits and complementarity in our relations. Such shall open new applications for economics and law.\r\n\r\nIn this paper a theory of planning horizons is introduced and then employed to raise some meaningful questions about the neoclassical view with respect to its substitution, decreasing returns and independence assumptions. Suppositions of complementarity, increasing returns and interdependence suggest that competition is inefficient by upholding a myopic culture resistant to change. Growth – though long believed to rise from markets and competitive values – may not derive from these sources. Instead, as civilizations advance, shifting from material wants to higher-order intangible output, they evolve from market tradeoffs (substitution and scarcity) into realms of common need (complementarity and abundance). If so, then neoclassical arguments shall no longer apply to any advanced information economy also restrained by its ecology.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this paper opens standard theory into a more general framework constructing ‘horizon effects’ into a case for cooperation – as more efficient than competition for all long-term problems of growth. The case is made that competition is keeping us stupid and immature, rewarding a myopic culture at the expense of learning and trust, therefore retarding economic growth instead of encouraging it as believed.\r\n\r\nThe policy implications of horizonal theory are explored, with respect to regulatory aims and economic concerns. Such an approach emphasizes strict constraints against entry barriers, ecological harm, market power abuse and ethical lapses. Social cohesion – not competition – is sought as a means to extend horizons and thereby increase efficiency, equity and ecological health. The overriding importance of horizon effects for regulatory assessment dominates other orthodox standards in economics and law. In sum, much of the reason for the failure of the Washington Consensus stems from myopic concerns central to any horizonal view. Reframing economics along horizonal lines suggests some meaningful insight to how regulations should be designed to keep pace with this approach in economics and law.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jennings, Frederic"],"dc:date":"2007-09-29","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Armen A Alchian.

A particularly interesting phenomenon is however present in the configuration of the languages present and used in the country, and how language links up the general population.  Though there are two proportionately large indigenous languages spoken in the country, Temne and Mende, it is found that the language which has spread and serves as a universal lingua franca known by as much as 95% of the population of Sierra Leone is in fact an English-based creole known as Krio, which is the mother tongue of a much smaller group of speakers primarily localized in and near the capital city Freetown.  This chapter examines the growing significance of Krio in Sierra Leone and how it originally developed as a contact language among different groups of resettled emancipated slaves and other indigenous inhabitants of the Freetown area.  The implications of the growth of Krio for national language policy and the position of English as the official language are examined, as well as the existence of ambivalent and changing attitudes towards the Krio language.","bibo:AuthorList":["Oyètádé, B.

Having been formed as a united territory by British colonial forces in 1914, with artificially created borders arbitrarily including certain ethnic groups while dividing others with neighbouring states, Nigeria and its complex ethno-linguistic situation in many ways is a prime representation of the classic set of problems faced by many newly developing states in Africa when decisions of national language policy and planning have to be made, and the potential role of language in nation-building has to be determined. When independence came to Nigeria in 1960, it was agreed that English would be the country\u0027s single official language, and there was little serious support support for the possible attempted promotion of any of Nigeria\u0027s indigenous languages into the role of national official language. This chapter considers the socio-political and historical background to the establishment of English as Nigeria\u0027s official language, and the development of the country over the subsequent post-independence era, and asks the following question. After five decades of experience of life with English as the nation\u0027s sole official language, if people in Nigeria were to be given the opportunity to reformulate national language policy as they wished, might one expect a different official language structure to be requested, perhaps with one or a combination of indigenous languages as a replacement for English, or is the current English-centred structuring of officialdom felt to be satisfactory and appropriate given the ethnic configuration of the country?","bibo:AuthorList":["Simpson , Andrew","Oyètádé, B.

Through an analysis of Amnesty International and its ambivalent grounding in Kantian notions of morality, and by considering competing religious and national claims to authority, I assess whether or not human rights activism suffers from an inescapable political ineptitude that must eventually see it decline in the face of more ardent and politically effective authority claims.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hopgood, Stephen"],"dc:date":"2007-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Yet the Sthanakavasi tradition has not received any attention by academic scholarship. The present article is the third of a five-part history of the Sthanakavasi tradition, based on textual and ethnographic sources.\r\nThe first part (BIS 13/14 2000) gave an overview of the history and doctrines of the Sthanakavasi mendicant traditions, from the reforms of Lonka in the 15th century, until the creation of a unified Sramanasangha under the command of a single acarya in 1952. It analysed the aims and structure of Sramanasangha, and the refusal of many Sthanakavasi orders in Gujarat and Rajasthan to join the new organisation. In conclusion, four types of Jainism were distinguished: canonical, classical or traditional, protestant, and post-protestant. The Sthanakavasi tradition represents a mixture of protestant and traditional elements. Part II investigates the sectarian dynamic within the Sramanasangha in conjunction with the history and structure of the independent Sthanakavasi traditions in Malva. It starts with a critical analysis of the notion of \u002722 schools\u0027 (baistola) of the Dharmadasa tradition, from which most Malva traditions are derived. The analysis of the relationship between the segments of the Dharmadasa traditions inside and outside the Sramanasangha, leads to the identification of three principal variables of Jain monastic organisation: descent, seniority, and succession. These structuring devices are used to mediate between the imperatives of historical legitimation and maintenance of differential group identity.\r\nIt is argued that the new Sthanakavasi lists of succession (pattavalis), the prime markers of sectarian identity, were constructed retrospectively on the basis of lists of descent (gurvavalis) and biographical poems, not the other way round, as commonly assumed. Part III continues the analysis of the Dharmadasa traditions outside Gujarat, with a focus on history, doctrine, monastic rules and practices: Dharmadasa Sampradaya (Haridas-Tradition); Jñangacch and Nava Jñangacch (Ramcandra-Tradition); Jaymalgacch (Jaymal-Tradition); Ratnavams (Kusala-Tradition); Vardhamana Vitarag Sampradaya (Kusala-Tradition); Amarmuni Sampradaya I-II (Manohardas-Tradition). Parts IV-V describe the Sthanakavasi traditions in the Panjab and Gujarat, and the overall context of Jain politics of religious modernisation in the 19th - 20th centuries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108897,"sim:weight":0.796155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1106100,"sim:weight":0.751681,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17865,"sim:weight":0.749655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108513,"sim:weight":0.452064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2792576,"sim:weight":0.228577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2786490,"sim:weight":0.226297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2789175,"sim:weight":0.137411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2790679,"sim:weight":0.127735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788341,"sim:weight":0.118558,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This contrasts other known logophoric reference systems, which typically exhibit two sets of mutually exclusive pronouns, one logophoric and one non-logophoric. It has been commonly held in the literature that the function of logophoric pronouns is not to disambiguate coreference of clausal arguments, but to indicate the expression of a point of view distinct from that articulated using non-logophoric personal pronouns. In this paper, the properties of logophoric reference in Gokana (Hyman and Comrie 1981) and Kana (Ikoro 1996) are introduced before discussing new data from Eleme. Evidence is presented that point of view does not play a role in the use of logophoric marking in Eleme. Rather, it is argued that the logophoric trigger is determined by the interaction of person, number and grammatical relation hierarchies allowing for the development of a unique and comparably pervasive system of coreference.","bibo:AuthorList":["Bond, Oliver","Mugane, John","Hutchinson, John P.","Worman, Dee A."],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"G Clements.

The functional distribution of these adverbial intensifiers is unusual, however, in that some are \"bipolar\", i.e., they can express opposite (minimal/maximal) values according to whether they occur in negative or positive syntactic environments, with the minimal intensifiers operating at the negative pole. An intensifier such as dàɗai, for example, can mean either \u0027never\u0027 (negative) or \u0027always\u0027 (positive), and other modifiers, e.g., atàbau, can express these same temporal meanings in addition to \u0027absolutely\u0027. This paper provides a unified account of this natural functional class of adverbs, and is seen as a contribution to cross-linguistic research into polarity items and their licensing contexts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jaggar, Philip J.","Cyffer, Norbert","Ebermann, Erwin","Ziegelmeyer, Georg"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Newman.

They have to a great extent isolated, and to a lesser degree diminished, the leadership of Congo and the power of the invaders. The forms of economic survival dispute authority by depriving the state (or predatory nonstate actors) of revenue, whilst maximising the opportunities for survival irrespective of – and in defiance of – the coercion to which people are exposed. The violent regimes in Congo have broken the country to the extent that they were able, but the fact that they cannot break it all attests to the resistance against them: for the powerful, as for the powerless, there may be a will, but there has been no way to achieve it completely.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marriage, Zoe"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Fernand Bézy.

{"identifier":2786473,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Articles","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"A Short History of Jaina Law","bibo:abstract":"The nineteenth century English neologism ‘Jaina law’ is a product of colonial legal intervention in India from 1772 onwards. \u0027Jaina law\u0027 suggests uniformity where in reality there is a plurality of scriptures, ethical and legal codes, and customs of sect, caste, family and region. The contested semantics of the term reflect alternative attempts by the agents of the modern Indian legal system and by Jain reformers to restate traditional Jain concepts. Four interpretations of the modern term \u0027Jaina law\u0027 can be distinguished: \r\n\r\n(i)\t\u0027Jaina law\u0027 in the widest sense signifies the doctrine and practice of jaina dharma, or Jaina ‘religion’.\r\n(ii)\tIn a more specific sense it points to the totality of conventions (vyavahāra) and law codes (vyavasthā) in Jaina monastic and lay traditions.  Sanskrit vyavasthā and its Arabic and Urdu equivalent qānūn both designate a specific code of law or legal opinion/decision, whereas Sanskrit dharma can mean religion, morality, custom and law. \r\n(iii)\tThe modern Indian legal system is primarily concerned with the \u0027personal law\u0027 of the Jaina laity. In Anglo-Indian case law, the term \u0027Jaina law\u0027 was used both as a designation for \u0027Jain scriptures\u0027 (śāstra) on personal law, and for the unwritten \u0027customary laws\u0027 of the Jains, that is the social norms of Jain castes (jāti) and clans (gotra). \r\n(iv)\tIn 1955/6 Jaina personal law was submerged under the statutory \u0027Hindu Code\u0027, and is now only indirectly recognised by the legal system in the form of residual Jain \u0027customs\u0027 to be proved in court.\r\n\r\nThe article traces the process in modern Indian legal history of narrowing the semantic range of the modern term \u0027Jaina law\u0027 from \u0027Jain scriptures\u0027 down to \u0027Jain personal law\u0027 and finally \u0027Jain custom\u0027, which may lead not only in the official obliteration of Jaina legal culture, which continues to thrive outside the formal legal system  in monastic law, ethics and custom, but also of Jaina \u0027religion\u0027.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Primary Sources AD Ācāradinakara of Vardhamānasūri, 1411 C.E.","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"Primary Sources AD Ācāradinakara of Vardhamānasūri, 1411 C.E."},{"rawReferenceText":"(1906).

In so doing, it focuses on the ideological struggle between the traditional party line and “Yishuvism,” a theory that sought to reconcile Zionist and communist ideas, as it played out in the two bodies most closely involved in shaping Comintern policy on Palestine (the Palestine Communist Party and the Communist Party of Great Britain). In following the tortured justifications for evolving positions, the author identifies the key actors shaping the debate and turning points impacting it, especially the 1936–39 Arab Revolt, Britain’s 1939 White Paper, and the wartime fight against fascism. The author contends that an important reason for the USSR’s post-war about-face on Palestine was the success of the Yishuvist ideological campaign.","bibo:AuthorList":["Franzén, Johan"],"dc:date":"2007-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58478,"sim:weight":0.442758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710657,"sim:weight":0.411788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43690,"sim:weight":0.321151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187538,"sim:weight":0.283677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9849,"sim:weight":0.263817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43243,"sim:weight":0.247223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56356,"sim:weight":0.246334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187444,"sim:weight":0.237754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18028,"sim:weight":0.219237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75513,"sim:weight":0.217278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187677,"sim:weight":0.201127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43564,"sim:weight":0.185773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187685,"sim:weight":0.102669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":2786490,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Book Chapters","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The Unknown Lonka: Tradition and the Cultural Unconscious","bibo:abstract":"The article investigates the effective history of the ideas of the 15th century Svetambara Jaina lay reformer Lonka, who is regarded as the founder of the aniconic or \u0027protestant\u0027 Jaina tradition. The article delimits the scope of Lonks\u0027s influence on the still existing but ignored Lonkagaccha tradition, which has lost all memory of its own past and on the aniconic Sthanakavasi and Terapanth traditions. Lonka\u0027s life and work is almost entirely unknown. This is partly due to the deliberate suppression of his ideas by his opponents, and partly because of the competitive appropriation of his legacy by the aniconic Sthanakavasi and Terapanth Jaina traditions. Informed by Jan Assmann\u0027s theory of the cultural unconscious, the article critically reviews the available sources on Lonka and the Lonkagaccha, focusing on processes of canonisation and repression of memory, and on techniques of selective citation and re-combination of transmitted elements of the Jain tradition through which authority was claimed both by Lonka and his successors and by modern Jain authors who tried to establish Lonka as an ancestral figure for competing factions of the aniconic Jaina tradition. The article is in two parts. First, the ways in which the teachings of Lonka and the Lonkagaccha tradition are depicted in modern Jaina historiographic literature is explored, and how the scant information on Lonka was compiled and redacted by different interested parties, and then some of the texts which were attributed to Lonka himself by D.D. Malvaniya are translated and analysed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter","Caillat, Colette","Balbir, Nalini"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(1926). of Saüvat 1830 in the Rūpacanda Rāmacanda Upāśraya, Jaitāraõa.)

{"identifier":2786631,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Articles","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Jaina Relic Stūpas","bibo:abstract":"It is a common stereotype of textbooks on world religions that Jains never worshipped the remains of the Jinas, and consequently never developed a ritual culture parallel to the cult of relics in Buddhism. Apart from isolated myths and legends in canonical and medieval Jain literature, depicting the veneration of the relics of the tīrthaṅkaras by the gods, there is no indication of bone relic worship in early and medieval Jainism to date. This report gives a brief overview of recent, somewhat unexpected, findings on the thriving cult of bone relic stūpas and the ritual role of the materiality of the dead amongst contemporary Jains. Although classical Jain doctrine rejects the worship of material objects, intermittent fieldwork in India, between 1997-2004, on the hitherto unstudied current Jain mortuary rituals furnished clear evidence for the ubiquity of bone relic stūpas and relic veneration across the Jain sectarian spectrum. British Academy funded research in 2000-2001 produced the first documentation of two modern Jain bone relic stūpas, a samādhi and a smāraka, constructed by the Terāpanth Śvetāmbara Jains. Subsequent fieldwork fundet by the Central Research Fund of the University of London demonstrated that relic stūpas are not only a feature of the aniconic Jain traditions, but also of Mūrtipūjaka and Digambara traditions. Hence a general distinction of rites commemoration and rites of empowerment in the Jaina tradition is suggested. The article reviews the potential significance of these findings for the history of religions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter"],"dc:date":"2008-03","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Lawrence A Babb.

The principal aim of this analysis is to underline the early Tibetan antecedents for the catalogues contained in the Section on Law and State. By relating the catalogues of the Section on Law and State to Old Tibetan sources, this analysis describes in detail the legal and administrative practices of the Tibetan Empire (c.600-c.850). Among the topics covered by this analysis are historical geography and the ‘nationalisation’ of clan territory, social stratification, technological innovation and legal culture. The Section on Law and State is not limited solely to law and administration, however, and also offers insights regarding cultural institutions such as religious practices and Tibetan funerary culture.\r\nTaken together, the scattered and fragmentary catalogues that make up the Section on Law and State, many of which ultimately derive from manuals and official records from the imperial period, constitute a rare juridical corpus of the Tibetan Empire. As such, it furnishes important and detailed information about the legal and administrative culture of the Tibetan Empire, and constitutes a fundamental source for Tibetan social history. The preservation of such documents within Tibet’s post-dynastic religious histories underlines the persistence of Tibetan political theory, according to which divine rulers, Buddhist or otherwise, must govern according to the just traditions of their forebears.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dotson, Brandon"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(1991).

Yet the Sthanakavasi tradition has not received any attention by academic scholarship. The present article is the third of a five-part history of the Sthanakavasi tradition, based on textual and ethnographic sources.\r\nThe first part (BIS 13/14 2000) gave an overview of the history and doctrines of the Sthanakavasi mendicant traditions, from the reforms of Lonka in the 15th century, until the creation of a unified Sramanasangha under the command of a single acarya in 1952. It analysed the aims and structure of Sramanasangha, and the refusal of many Sthanakavasi orders in Gujarat and Rajasthan to join the new organisation. In conclusion, four types of Jainism were distinguished: canonical, classical or traditional, protestant, and post-protestant. The Sthanakavasi tradition represents a mixture of protestant and traditional elements. Part II investigates the sectarian dynamic within the Sramanasangha in conjunction with the history and structure of the independent Sthanakavasi traditions in Malva. It starts with a critical analysis of the notion of \u002722 schools\u0027 (baistola) of the Dharmadasa tradition, from which most Malva traditions are derived. The analysis of the relationship between the segments of the Dharmadasa traditions inside and outside the Sramanasangha, leads to the identification of three principal variables of Jain monastic organisation: descent, seniority, and succession. These structuring devices are used to mediate between the imperatives of historical legitimation and maintenance of differential group identity.\r\nIt is argued that the new Sthanakavasi lists of succession (pattavalis), the prime markers of sectarian identity, were constructed retrospectively on the basis of lists of descent (gurvavalis) and biographical poems, not the other way round, as commonly assumed. Part III continues the analysis of the Dharmadasa traditions outside Gujarat, with a focus on history, doctrine, monastic rules and practices: Dharmadasa Sampradaya (Haridas-Tradition); Jñangacch and Nava Jñangacch (Ramcandra-Tradition); Jaymalgacch (Jaymal-Tradition); Ratnavams (Kusala-Tradition); Vardhamana Vitarag Sampradaya (Kusala-Tradition); Amarmuni Sampradaya I-II (Manohardas-Tradition). Parts IV-V describe the Sthanakavasi traditions in the Panjab and Gujarat, and the overall context of Jain politics of religious modernisation in the 19th - 20th centuries.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108897,"sim:weight":0.842576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108763,"sim:weight":0.323914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2792576,"sim:weight":0.239068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2790679,"sim:weight":0.122659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2789175,"sim:weight":0.1073,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788341,"sim:weight":0.0617171,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

International Assistance to Countries at War","bibo:abstract":"Why do humanitarian principles, human rights and other ‘rules’ espoused by aid organisations apparently fail to influence the reality of assistance delivery, whilst reality does not dint these objectives? Not breaking the rules, not playing the game investigates the international assistance given in countries at war. Presenting evidence from Sierra Leone, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and southern Sudan, it finds that appeal to a morality based on rights and principles allows aid staff to justify their operational weaknesses by blaming or discrediting others. The terminology used casts political and military activity as illegitimate, forestalling dialogue, limiting aid organisations’ perception of the contexts in which they work, and ultimately questioning the sincerity of the assistance. The book concludes that people in countries at war are not ‘breaking the rules’ of assistance – as assistance is not meaningfully ‘ruled’ by rights or principles – they are more fundamentally ‘not playing the game’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marriage , Zoe"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It centres on the question how the national community is historicised via central myths, especially for the pre-Islamic periods. As a source basis writings of members of the intellectual elite which are published in newspapers are used. \r\nThis article argues that identity in the Kurdish society is currently mainly constructed around an ethnic history, which assumes Kurdishness to be constant and which is based on a dichotomy between barbarism and civilisation. The discursive space for this historiography is mainly determined by Turkish national discourse in its popular version. Finally, a comparative outlook with the Iraqi case is suggested.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hirschler, Konrad"],"dc:date":"2001-07-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.469515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383512,"sim:weight":0.360968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383616,"sim:weight":0.350895,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101403,"sim:weight":0.324616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5079544,"sim:weight":0.317104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227101,"sim:weight":0.265858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108348,"sim:weight":0.262698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108395,"sim:weight":0.261486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75990,"sim:weight":0.259801,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5079552,"sim:weight":0.258108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383571,"sim:weight":0.254177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95198,"sim:weight":0.246613,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930824,"sim:weight":0.2405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383497,"sim:weight":0.229378,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930823,"sim:weight":0.223427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108271,"sim:weight":0.223208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225591,"sim:weight":0.21669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":632743,"sim:weight":0.213693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85220,"sim:weight":0.212357,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44363,"sim:weight":0.211203,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The tenacity of the conflict lies in two competing concerns: the assertion of self-determination rights of the Moro separatist movement; and the affirmation of the Philippines’ sovereign right to territorial integrity. However, beneath these rights are crucial issues that remain unanswered both by the contending forces—problems where internecine violence and conflict emanate from. This article argues that self-determination rights can be adequately exercised by people who have clearly defined their national identity and concept of a nation. Unfortunately, the Moro multi-ethnic national identity has yet to be crystallised while the idea of a Bangsamoro (Bangsa Nation) remains weak. On the other hand, the state has yet to address the Moros’ legitimate demands of political autonomy, socio-economic development, and social justice and discrimination. Without underestimating the ethnic component of secessionism, the article concludes that poor governance has prolonged, complicated, and further justified the Moros’ quest to secede from the Republic.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buendia, Rizal"],"dc:date":"2005-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2788416,"sim:weight":0.772333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2787658,"sim:weight":0.516054,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It analyses for the first time the relationship between a particular Jain monastic order and its lay following, together forming a \u0027four-fold\u0027 Jain sub-sect. Śvetāmbara Mendicants are organised in form of independent monastic orders. In aniconic Jain sects such as the Terāpanth the mendicants are the sole focus of the religious life of the laity. Image-veneration and temples which furnish an alternative organisational focus in the Mūrtipūjaka and Digambara traditions are rejected, as is the concept of religious property in general. The regional and supra-regional networks of Jain mendicants and laity are coordinated through the annual intinerary (vihāra) of the mendicants whose varying pattern is determined by the ācārya, the leader of the monastic order. At the annual assembly of the Terāpanth mendicants, the maryādā mahotsava, this is done in response to a process of competitive invitations by local Terāpanth lay communities. Based on both textual sources and fieldwork, the article describes in detail the strict Terāpanth distinction between religious (lokottara) and social (laukika) values, informing the vihāra and concepts and practices of gift-giving, compassion, merit and wellbeing which are quite distinct from competing Sthānakavāsī, Mūrtipūjaka and Digambara Jaina traditions. The case of the Terāpanth demonstrates that the theory of two levels of Jain values, \u0027liberation and wellbeing\u0027 defining an ambiguous intermediary \u0027socio-religious\u0027 realm, is not a universally accepted doctrine within the Jain tradition. The investigation of the relationship between religion and economics in the Terāpanth community further shows that socio-religious and economic status do not necessarily overlap. Social status can only be converted into economic credit in the context of monopoly markets.\r\n\r\nThe empirical findings are discussed with reference to the theory of communicative action providing an alternative analytical framework to both Neo-Kantian theories of value and Foucaultian theories of power currently dominating the academic discourse on contemporary Jainism.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter"],"dc:date":"1996","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[{"rawReferenceText":"Peter FLÜGEL. 1995-96.

The analysis of Bühler’s tactics in gaining access and of Jain laity to gain permission to publish the original Jain manuscripts demonstrates the significance of conflicting interests within the Jain community, and the historical importance of the alliance of Indologists and proponents of Jain modernism, particularly Digambara Jain lawyers and reform-oriented Mūrtipūjaka Śvetāmbara monks, for the construction of Jain communal identity during the colonial period.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter"],"dc:date":"1999-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The ethnography in this paper outlines a number of perspectives on the role of such intermediaries (here ‘saints’) in Muslim society in western India. In the South Asian literature, historians have provided a thorough treatment of the doctrinal history and content of these debates.  However, very little attention has been paid to how living individuals interpret and rehearse these debates in practice. The examination of the changing perspectives of three Muslim men on the question of saint worship over a ten-year period reveals the following. First, an individual’s relationship with ‘saints’ is often determined primarily by social context rather than simply by doctrinal allegiance or the compulsions of particular ‘beliefs’. Second, discourses of religious reform are also powerful social objects that can be used as political instruments for purposes other than simply refining the religious practices of a community. Finally, many commonplace assumptions in the literature – notably on the nature of belief and the significance of doctrinal divisions among Muslims – do not withstand ethnographic scrutiny.","bibo:AuthorList":["Simpson, Edward"],"dc:date":"2007-03-01","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"I Ahmad.

It will provide a historical background in terms of changing women’s status and gender ideologies \u0026 relations during the regime of Saddam Hussein. I will focus particularly on the impacts of the early developmental-modernist discourses of the state to the impacts of war (Iran-Iraq war 1980-88 \u0026 Gulf War 1991) as well as comprehensive economic sanctions (1990-2003). The latter involved wider social changes affected women and gender but also society at large, i.e. impoverishment of well-educated middle-class, wide-scale unemployment and economic crises pushing women back home, and a shift towards more conservative values and morals. \r\nIt is against this backdrop that the impact of the latest war (2003), the occupation and reconstruction attempts need to analysed. In addition to the most immediate effects of the current situation (humanitarian crisis, lack of security, lack of mobility, general exclusion form political process), the article will explore more long- term issues with respect to the need to mainstream gender in reconstruction processes. It will also attempt to provide a brief overview of the emerging Iraqi women’s national and transnational women’s initiatives and organisations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Al-Ali, Nadje"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"War: Feminist Perspectives.","authors":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"War: Feminist Perspectives."},{"rawReferenceText":"Nadje Al-Ali.

However, it will highlight those less well-known libraries and other institutions that hold material of interest to researchers of the Malay World, particularly those institutions primarily perceived as dealing with the world of science rather than the humanities.\r\n\r\nCollections relating to the Malay World held in British libraries and archives are particularly rich in historical, literary and linguistic material. Historians, linguists and those interested in literature will obviously look to institutions such as the British Library, SOAS Library and other well-known centres of Asian history, linguistics and literature. But would they think to look in the libraries and archives of such places as the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; the Natural History Museum; the National maritime Museum; the Science Museum; the Zoological Society; the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine; and the Linnean Society?\r\n\r\nThe great scientific institutions of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries collected a vast range of material, primarily focussing on their areas of interest, but not exclusively so. The boundaries between what we see as science, the social sciences and the humanities were less precise in the past than they are today, and historical collections held in scientific institutions cover a broader range of interests than many present-day researchers realise.\r\n\r\nIn previous centuries a “scientist” was not just a person specialising in pure science but someone of a broad education who was as likely to be interested in not just his chosen field but in the wider world around him. His collecting, research and writing often reflected this wider interest. Such permissive collecting often led to items, that could be of interest to a varied range of researchers, being absorbed into, and unintentionally hidden in, a specialist collection.\r\n\r\nHow something is classified and arranged in a collection can exclude information and restrict access as much as provide information and allow access.\r\n\r\nThis paper will attempt to show the wealth of material on the Malay World held in British institutions, particularly scientific institutions, and suggests that researchers should look beyond a narrow view of their subject and where they think material would be held.","bibo:AuthorList":["Martland, Nicholas"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It illustrates that the mechanisms enabling those firms to benefit from financial globalization are more complex than the “direct” financial channels outlined in the neo-classical approach. China provides an important example in this context, as its capital market liberalization has been limited and neither the legal nor financial system is well developed. Yet micro-level evidence from China’s internationally listed enterprises indicates that innovative firms can overcome institutional thresholds, secure access to international capital, and benefit and learn from international capital markets.

It focuses on an analysis of the Terāpanth Śvetāmbara Jain mendicant order and presents translations and analyses of the rules and regulations and initiation rituals for a new category of Jain novices, the samaṇ order, which was introduced by the Terāpanth in 1981. It is argued that variations and cumulative changes in post-canonical monastic law can be understood in terms of rule specification and secondary canonization and not only in terms of exceptions to the rule. The article contributes both to the anthropology of South Asian asceticism and monasticism and to the exploration of the maryādā and āvaśyaka literatures of the Jains.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter"],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"(1884).

Indian Agriculture and the Limits of Commercialization in Nineteenth-Century Bihar","bibo:abstract":"The article attempts to distinguish and locate choices in agricultural production, with special reference to Bihar, India, during the nineteenth century. On the one hand, it considers closely managed and extensively irrigated areas, long involved in trade under the overall control of \u0027landlords\u0027, and, on the other hand, the expanding production of opium, and also of indigo and sugar (so-called \u0027forced\u0027 commercialization), identifying common features and continuities of production and marketing. Particular the importance of advance payments and local intermediaries is stressed. Thus, in contrast with the more usual evolutionary models, based on unitary categories and modes, the essay illustrates ecological, customary, collective, and local political constraints upon agricultural decisions; and this leads to the identification in turn of their different kinds and levels.","bibo:AuthorList":["Robb, Peter"],"dc:date":"1992-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The secessionist movement in the Philippines led by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) has focused and relied on the international community to support its struggle for a Bangsa Moro (Moro Nation) right to self-determination.\r\nHowever, the reality in the world state system is the protection of the state\u0027s territorial integrity rather than its impairment. The paper argues that the internationally-recognized right to self-determination is a shaky promise of independence to nations and peoples who seek independence\r\nfrom the state. Unless the state addresses the fundamental grievances of Muslims in the Philippines in appropriate, relevant, and timely policies that substantially and tangibly work toward greater democracy, deeper participation, and better governance, secessionism as a political alternative cannot be completely disregarded as a final option.","bibo:AuthorList":["Buendia, Rizal"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Journal Books.

It sketches how projects of the Muslim public self contribute to a refiguring of the public sphere. The argument put forward is that public practices of self-reform grounded in religion and presented in pietistic terms are political by virtue of being tied to projects of societal reform and because they have a bearing on the public sphere and public space. Proceeding from the premise that the public sphere is not neutral and that the subjectivities inhabiting it are shaped by power relations, the article examines the ways in which projects of Muslim public selves are imbricated in the material conditions of the settings in which they develop and as such are underpinned by dynamics of power and contestation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ismail, Salwa"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"Sarah BenNefissa.

The Holy Spirit is given to us to enable us to grow in love. In order to make wise decisions we need to have internalised God’s law and to meditate on it with the help of the Spirit. In heaven, doing what God wants will be second nature.

Individual concerns inter-mingle with collective endeavours in both traditional and new ways. This article explores such collective forms of public action in the aftermath of the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, and the role of nostalgia as a mobilising political force in particular. Nostalgia emerges as both a creative and cathartic force, but its effects on public action are short-lived. It is argued that nostalgia has a short life span not simply because the disaster moves into the past and new concerns come to the fore but because the changing dynamics of the relationship between individuals and social collectives make nostalgia an unsustainable form of collective representation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Simpson, Edward"],"dc:date":"2008-05-21","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"J M Albala-Bertrand.

Imagination, epistemology, and the state in western India","bibo:abstract":"In this paper, I analyse and reason with the patterns of discrimination evident in the reconstruction initiatives following the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat. I do so in order to explain what discrimination there was, and how and why such discrimination was related to broader patterns of social polarisation. After the earthquake, the political state of Gujarat made the headlines following widespread violence in 2002. This led to a flurry of publications in which anger and indignation led to the over-statement of the links between the government, social life in the state, and the politics of religious (Hindu-Muslim) communalism. This paper is an attempt to chip away to the impression thus created of a land consumed only by the violent compulsions of Hindu nationalism. I do so not through polemic, but ethnography, as a way of suggesting it is simply wrong to conflate state complicity in the anti-Muslim violence of 2002 with all other routine operations performed by government. Given Gujarat’s reputation for Hindu nationalism, my analysis unsurprisingly confirms the scholarship of others by showing how some powerful Hindu-oriented non-governmental organisations have drawn power and resources away from the state to parade before the people as if they govern. However, more importantly, the ethnography of the mixed-fortunes of Muslims in the rubble also illustrates some of the limits to the power of the Hindu nationalists: the data shows that the Hindu nationalists have not hijacked the state in its entirety and their influence is clearly curtailed and imperfect. By clothing the Hindu nationalist in unassailably powerful terms, the academic critic, I argue, has paradoxically almost become culpable in the success of the nationalist, by conferring on their rhetoric the status of reality, and on them power.","bibo:AuthorList":["Simpson, Edward"],"dc:date":"2008-07-31","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"S Agnivesh and V Thampu.

{"identifier":2788736,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Conference or Workshop Items","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Historicising African Contributions to the Emancipation Movement: The Haitian Revolution, 1791-1805","bibo:abstract":"The Haitian Revolution was the first incidence of mass emancipation in a colonial society and the only slave revolt that resulted in the formation of a modern state. However, existing canonical works on this revolution have largely concentrated on providing a central symbiotic relationship between the slave revolt and the broader changes in the Atlantic World during the 18th century. It has even been widely assumed that the Haitian Revolution was intellectually inspired by Western cultural values. Indeed, the Yoruba slave, Dutty Boukman, who ignited the revolution has been reduced to a mere footnote in the body of the prevailing Western-biased Haitian hegemonic historiography. This paper argues that the revolution, which was historically rooted in a legendary Yoruba tradition that abhors injustice, corruption and oppression, represents the very best of Yoruba’s cultural attainment in the Diaspora. The study further ‘resurrects’ the monumental contributions of Dutty Bookman to the outbreak of the revolution and underscores the fact that the Yoruba god of Ogun was the most portent rallying force that drove the revolution. Thus, the paper situates the cultural roots of the Haitian Revolution in its proper historical perspective and challenges one of the prevailing stereotypes about the “meagre” contributions of enslaved Africans to the emancipation of African slaves. The study, therefore, represents a major revision of the current historiography on the emancipation movement, and further highlights the methodological challenges of reconstructing the history of the slave trade in the Diaspora.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ogen, Olukoya"],"dc:date":"2008-10-21","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"T See.

This article discusses particularly those places situated on cemeteries and the practices conducted during their visitation. The pilgrimage to these places engendered in the period’s scholarly circles numerous theological and social controversies. The theological debate is discussed with reference to the position of Ibn Taymiya (d. 728/1328), whose sharp opposition to the most current practices of pilgrimage remained however a minority stance. The bulk of the religious scholars defended theses pilgrimages as permissible. It was rather the social practices which aroused the scholars’ concern and which were criticised in explicit terms. Here, the fear of illicit contacts between men and women as well as between Muslims and non-Muslims constituted the dominating issues. On the basis of normative treatises, especially theological writings, pilgrim guides, chronicles, and biographical dictionaries it is finally shown that the pilgrimages to such ‘minor’ places encompassed large sections of the population and was not limited to a phenomenon of ‘popular’ culture.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hirschler, Konrad","Messner, A.","Hirschler, Konrad"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.262088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929831,"sim:weight":0.259313,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090427,"sim:weight":0.254276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43652,"sim:weight":0.250221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76473,"sim:weight":0.246065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090441,"sim:weight":0.234377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108122,"sim:weight":0.234324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43669,"sim:weight":0.224114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108348,"sim:weight":0.2217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76471,"sim:weight":0.218086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43701,"sim:weight":0.217938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.216587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108154,"sim:weight":0.207717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381919,"sim:weight":0.19694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48400,"sim:weight":0.192955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":10913,"sim:weight":0.192341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108931,"sim:weight":0.192239,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43833,"sim:weight":0.191277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43705,"sim:weight":0.190408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108825,"sim:weight":0.182401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The Expo thus suggests that we need to supplement our understanding of spectacle as communication with an analysis of spectacle as a system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lockyer, Angus"],"dc:date":"2007-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Increasing access and dominance in the 18th and 19th did not necessarily encourage greater accuracy.

While many of the dogmatic statements expressed in Islamic theology naturally emanate from a traditional substratum, countless more are the result of dialectical discussions as theologians expounded upon abstract constructs of religious dogma. Recent academic research is exploring the history, trends, and conceptual achievements behind the Islamic experiment with theology, providing insights into the tradition’s ability to integrate, refine, and expand theological constructs. Scholars are also concerned with issues such as origins, authenticity, and ascription, although such matters are not deflecting attention from the rich stock of resources and materials kalam has to offer.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shah, Mustafa"],"dc:date":"2007-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2793513,"sim:weight":0.582047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Most Japanese-language publications on Japanese TV commercials have already proved this trend quantitatively, yet qualitative work on Japanese TV commercials is scarce.  The aim of that paper is to link a quantitative to a qualitative approach in analysing a sample of the year 2002 in both ways while taking the quantitative background into account to elucidate possible developments.  In addition, some older commercials were also included in the sample in order to make a possible change in the patterns of representation more evident. \r\nDespite an ‘Asia boom’ in Japan throughout the 1990s, which influenced many other popular genres, Japanese TV commercials were by large unaffected of this trend.  In 2002, the Chinese characters did not appear in a large number.  In addition, they were still the only other Asians in Japanese commercials and their appearance was strongly linked to the product to be advertised (i.e. Oolong Tea and Chinese food).  Hence, stereotypes commonly associated with China were used in abundance in order to create a ‘Chinese flair’ for the Japanese product.  While in the 1990s, even Chinese stars appeared only in relation to products of Chinese origin, at the beginning of the new millennium, a certain tendency to dissolve the Chinese stars from this background and to present them in a less stereotypical way could be observed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kirsch, Griseldis","Oelschleger, Hans Dieter","Horres, Robert"],"dc:date":"2002","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2783531,"sim:weight":0.406393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187660,"sim:weight":0.320025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929870,"sim:weight":0.315279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222956,"sim:weight":0.309525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43579,"sim:weight":0.300251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931334,"sim:weight":0.275184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929838,"sim:weight":0.269703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187438,"sim:weight":0.268734,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76124,"sim:weight":0.246159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734388,"sim:weight":0.238186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77132,"sim:weight":0.233041,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98664,"sim:weight":0.226328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186613,"sim:weight":0.221524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23709,"sim:weight":0.213187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929825,"sim:weight":0.201184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102591,"sim:weight":0.193946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48378,"sim:weight":0.182475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381999,"sim:weight":0.174428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9039648,"sim:weight":0.174028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.171347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although throughout most of its history, Japanese TV drama has focused on ‘Japanese’ topics set in Japan – thus underpinning the myth of Japanese homogeneity – in the late 1990s, the genre began to slowly internationalise. In the wake of that ‘internationalisation’, more Asian characters were also brought to the small screens and the genre ‘discovered’ interculturality. \r\nCentring on the content analysis of two TV dramas of the years 2001 and 2002 respectively, this paper aims to work out how the encounter of female characters with another culture took place. The first drama to be analysed, features a young woman of Japanese-Taiwanese parentage coming to Japan whereas the second drama focuses on the encounter of three Japanese women with Hong Kong. In contrasting the encounter of the women with the respective ‘Other’, it shall be elucidated how ‘identities’ are constructed in these two dramas and what kind of gender concepts are portrayed therein.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kirsch, Griseldis","Iwami, Teruyo","Yonaha, Keiko","Gössmann, Hilaria"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2792549,"sim:weight":0.129783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2792548,"sim:weight":0.12608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This article discusses whether beggars constituted (a) marginal group(s), focusing on the period from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries. The examination of specific sub-groups shows that beggary was perceived in highly differing terms. The moral right to beg was conceded to those who were not supported by a family network and unable to work because they were disabled or elderly. This contrasted with vagrant beggars belonging to the Banu Sasan, who clearly were considered as marginal. They played on this status through various means, such as developing a distinctive sociolect. In the same vein, mendicants of some mystical brotherhoods did not perceive themselves as normal members of society – nor did society perceive them as fulfilling the minimum cultural and moral norms. A further group subject to criticism were the urban settled beggars. However, as they conformed more closely to hegemonic cultural norms (e.g. in terms of appearance and language), they stood on the fringes of society to a lesser degree, and can hardly be described as a marginal group. The second question of this article concerns the nature of the relationships between power-holding elites and beggars. During the period under consideration, systematic repressive measures against beggars were infrequent and beggars rarely tended to form some kind of institutionalised fraternities in order to interact on an organised basis with the elites. It was only in the later Ottoman empire that beggars were subject to disciplinary regulations and were organised into associations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hirschler, Konrad","Pistor-Hatam, Anja","Richter , Antje"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Jahrhundert) (Rites of Violence: Violent Protests in Mamluk Cairo and Damascus)","bibo:abstract":"This article deals with violent forms of ‘popular’ protest and revolt in Cairo and Damascus between the 7th/13th and the 10th/16th centuries. It focuses on the symbolic expressions employed during such periods of violence in order to refine currently employed concepts such as ‘mob-violence’, which tend to describe such events as irrational and spasmodic. The symbolic expressions are analysed with regard to three main themes that played a salient role: the urban spaces that were the theatre of these events, the acoustic and visual symbols employed by the participants and specific ‘rites of violence’, (e.g. the lynching of representatives of the military elite). It is shown, firstly, that protest and violence was often underlain by an internal logic and that the participants employed well-chosen (spatial, acoustic, visual etc.) symbols in order to express their aims, for example the appropriation and manipulation of the call to prayer. Due to the local perspective chosen, it is possible to detect distinct differences among the towns of Damascus and Cairo concerning such symbols, for example with regard to the spatial setting for articulating discontent. Secondly, it is shown that the popular rites of violence developed in close interplay with expressions of violence by the ruling elites. This interplay was reflected on the one hand by ‘affirmative rites’ that adopted and partly modified violent behaviour that was typical for the ruling elite. On the other hand it is possible to detect ‘negating rites’ that tend to refer to local symbols and refuse to follow established patters, such as the ‘execution’ of an officer at a prominent locality in the local quarter and not at one of the official places of execution. The article argues finally that the polysemantic character of these events will only be fully understood by further studies that adopt additional local perspectives.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hirschler, Konrad","Conermann, S.","v.

The discussion is centred on the issue of ijtihad/taqlid, which featured prominently in revivalist thought. Taking the example of scholars in thirteenth-century Damascus, it firstly compares the respective readings of ijtihad/taqlid, by focusing on one individual, Abu Shama (d. 1267). It secondly asks whether a scholar like Abu Shama who had adopted a reading similar to later revivalists, also took a critical and oppositional stand against large sections of his contemporary society, i.e. a revivalist posture. It is this article’s main contention that the example of Abu Shama shows the need to study in more detail possible revivalist traditions prior to the ‘grand’ movements. The combination of the history of ideas and social history might allow a deeper understanding of how and in what contexts calls for reform and opposition to the current state of affairs were expressed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hirschler, Konrad"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This demand was in Hama initially satisfied with outside scholars, particularly those coming from the eastern lands. The decisive reason for the appointment of these scholars was their cosmopolitan background, i.e. a trans-regional reputation of scholarship and/or close links with the respective ruling dynasty. It took several decades until the grand Shafi\u0027i families developed from the late sixth/twelfth century onwards that centred their activities on Hama. This local elite was increasingly able to monopolise the town’s important posts during considerable parts of the seventh/thirteenth and eighth/fourteenth centuries. Descent from the Banu al-Mughayzil, al-Bahrani, Wasil, and al-Barizi remained throughout this period a crucial asset in order to secure one’s career. It was only in the middle of the eigth/fourteenth century that the civilian elite of Hama became less localised: more outside scholars took positions in the town and the local families either lost in influence or adopted an increasingly cosmopolitan profile (Banu al-Barizi). Some families, such as the Banu Qarnas and Banu Rawaha, on the contrary, chose already during the period of a localised elite a cosmopolitan outlook. Although originiating from Hama they were active in many urban centres of the Syrian lands.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hirschler, Konrad"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2788470,"sim:weight":0.268839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108350,"sim:weight":0.229301,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108849,"sim:weight":0.202036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316094,"sim:weight":0.190594,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":507110,"sim:weight":0.190284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108154,"sim:weight":0.189451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631817,"sim:weight":0.186142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780237,"sim:weight":0.184586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109031,"sim:weight":0.182294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43693,"sim:weight":0.181212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43705,"sim:weight":0.179185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43665,"sim:weight":0.177142,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108609,"sim:weight":0.175237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108699,"sim:weight":0.1744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930473,"sim:weight":0.173575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43664,"sim:weight":0.170206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43651,"sim:weight":0.168165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2777837,"sim:weight":0.168159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108651,"sim:weight":0.168098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108647,"sim:weight":0.167463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The paper suggests three broad types of strategy pursued by poor people: ‘hanging in’; ‘stepping up’; and ‘stepping out’.  This simple schema explicitly recognises the dynamic aspirations of poor people; diversity among them; and livelihood diversification. It also brings together aspirations of poor people with wider sectoral, inter-sectoral and macro-economic questions about policies necessary for realisation of those aspirations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dorward, Andrew","Anderson , S.","Nava, Y.","Pattison, J.","Paz, R.","Rushton, J.","Sanchez Vera , E."],"dc:date":"2009-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":76377,"sim:weight":0.5024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43479,"sim:weight":0.493338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5629,"sim:weight":0.477617,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108670,"sim:weight":0.444385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788824,"sim:weight":0.428488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664548,"sim:weight":0.404751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.403022,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316337,"sim:weight":0.381089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109342,"sim:weight":0.379698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77832,"sim:weight":0.375109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187716,"sim:weight":0.370538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.369281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.366739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.366739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.366739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.366739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.366739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.366739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.366739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.366739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The simplicity of this conceptualisation and its strong theoretical, empirical and experiential content make it a powerful framework both for inter-disciplinary, inter-sectoral, multi-scale analysis of dynamic development processes, and for structuring dialogue about contested aspirations, assumptions, modalities and constraints among development analysts and stakeholders with different interests and paradigms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dorward, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2009-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":2789157,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Articles","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Rural poverty in Mexico: assets and livelihood strategies among the Mayas of Yucatán","bibo:abstract":"Understanding poverty and sustainability needs livelihood studies that acknowledge heterogeneity at the community and household level. This is particularly true for Latin America where inequality and ethnicity are important aspects of poverty and sustainability. This paper is a detailed examination of the natural resources, socioeconomic assets and livelihood strategies of two Mayan communities of the Mexican State of Yucatán. There were three fundamental objectives: to elucidate the people’s perceptions of poverty, to analyze their resource use and livelihood strategies, and to suggest ways in which access to markets can reduce poverty and enhance sustainable development. \r\n\r\nUsing qualitative and quantitative methodologies, the dominance of certain successful strategies is made clear. Firstly, milpa – the traditional system of maize production - is a way of life for the Mayas. Secure access to maize-producing land is a valuable asset, partly because it also attracts government subsidies. Secondly, ownership of small livestock is also part of Mayan life. Ownership of other assets such as bee hives gives access to (relatively) lucrative product markets. Thirdly, active agribusiness marketing also requires assets: ownership of transport services; finance to assemble and sell products such as forest fruits, honey and maize; business skills and an ability to create commercial linkages to traders. Appropriate interventions for different wealth groups are suggested to enhance sustainable development of the communities.","bibo:AuthorList":["Poole, Nigel","Gauthier, Remi","Mizrahi, Aliza"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2788824,"sim:weight":0.450729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109092,"sim:weight":0.359899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.358284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.356788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.345567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.316076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.316076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77201,"sim:weight":0.310189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778978,"sim:weight":0.305217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.284973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":2789175,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Book Chapters","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Demographic Trends in Jaina Monasticism","bibo:abstract":"The study of Jainism as a lived religion is still hampered by a lack of reliable sociological and demographic information both on the Jain laity and Jain mendicants. Most empirical studies to date have been thematically oriented or were of an exploratory nature, based on the methods advanced by the classical anthropological village studies or on small surveys of a non-representative nature. In both cases, the units of investigation were defined in terms of observer categories which were often created ad hoc in the field due to the advantages of snowball sampling under conditions of limited resources. Despite the pioneering studies of Vilas Sangave (1959/1980) on the social divisions of the Jain lay community and of Muni Uttam Kamal Jain (1975) on the pre-modern history of the religious divisions of the Jain mendicants, most students of Jainism, and indeed most Jains, have still no way of knowing how many independent mendicant orders exist today and how they are organised. The aim of this article is to fill this gap and to provide a brief overview of the present schools, orders and sects within both the Śvetāmbara- and the Digambara-denomination by bringing together the available demographic data on the current Jain monastic traditions with a synopsis of their schismogenesis and an analysis of the principal dimensions of social organisation. It is argued that the reinvention of the tradition of the naked Digambara munis in the early twentieth century and the increasing level of education of Jain women together with organisational reforms of the Śvetāmbara orders are amongst several decisive causal factors informing the current exponential increase of the number of Jain mendicants. The most interesting result of this study is the emerging, nearly complete, pattern of the group structure of the current Jain mendicant traditions, including the Digambara traditions whose modern history is described for the first time. A comprehensive analysis of the Jain lay movements is beyond the scope of this article.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter","Flügel, Peter"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2792576,"sim:weight":0.5981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2789719,"sim:weight":0.578051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2786490,"sim:weight":0.572984,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2783522,"sim:weight":0.571427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2790679,"sim:weight":0.548913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2786473,"sim:weight":0.461335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2793904,"sim:weight":0.459135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":66779,"sim:weight":0.451144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2790773,"sim:weight":0.436951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2790101,"sim:weight":0.43535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2786631,"sim:weight":0.42033,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2790113,"sim:weight":0.395576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788341,"sim:weight":0.372097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108685,"sim:weight":0.324233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43495,"sim:weight":0.317021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633036,"sim:weight":0.312916,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43665,"sim:weight":0.300256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43359,"sim:weight":0.282625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43732,"sim:weight":0.275006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43652,"sim:weight":0.274388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In India over 50 million people are believed to be directly dependent upon NTFPs for their subsistence. However, such human dependence on NTFPs for livelihood gains (win) has most frequently been at a certain ecological cost (lose). If livelihoods are to be maintained, the existing ‘win-lose’ settings have to be steered to a ‘win-win’ mode, otherwise, there could be severe erosion of the biological resources and loss of livelihoods (‘lose-lose’). Examining the dependence of forest fringe communities on NTFPs at three sites in south India with contrasting human and ecological settings, three key factors (extent of dependence on NTFPs, indigenous ecological knowledge and market organization) are likely to constrain reaching the win-win situation. How these factors shape the ecological cost of harvesting NTFPs at the three sites is examined. Within the parameter space of these factors, it is possible to predict outcomes and associations that will conform to win-win or win-lose situations. Empirical data derived from the three study sites demonstrate the causality of the observed associations. The key for long-term livelihood gains lies in reducing the ecological cost. Certain interventions and recommendations that could optimize the balance between livelihood gains and ecological cost are proposed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shaanker, R.U.","Ganeshaiah, K.N.","Krishnan, Smitha","Ramya, R.","Meera, C.","Aravind, N.A.","Kumar, Arvind","Rao, Dinesh","Vanraj, G.","Ramachandra, J.","Gauthier, R.","Ghazoul, J.","Poole, Nigel","Chinnappa Reddy, B.V."],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58802,"sim:weight":0.478435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99327,"sim:weight":0.43255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43479,"sim:weight":0.424696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187449,"sim:weight":0.418686,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778978,"sim:weight":0.392597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.379483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.379483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":62357,"sim:weight":0.375347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97703,"sim:weight":0.374645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61464,"sim:weight":0.374591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.360046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61681,"sim:weight":0.354513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.352352,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.350382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.349306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.349306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.349306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.349306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.349306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.349306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Where previously finding information in all subjects was based around libraries, researchers in many subjects do not now physically go to libraries, but have convenient access to vast amounts of information from their desktops. In other subjects electronic resources have been embraced, but visits to libraries are as important as ever and continue to form the basis of research projects with researchers regularly travelling abroad to use particular collections.\r\n\r\nFor this study in depth investigations were conducted in two substantially dissimilar subjects, chemistry and ancient history, so that differences between them could be highlighted and light shed on developments in academia generally. Surveys were conducted with groups of six researchers from each subject, using detailed semi-structured interviews. All interviewees were asked the same set of questions and were encouraged to give their opinions on relevant issues so as to yield qualitative information about their behaviour and attitudes.\r\n\r\nThe investigation found that the information gathering behaviour of chemists and ancient historians has become more different, rather than more similar, with the explosion of the use of electronic resources. Reasons for this include different methodologies, finances, the composition of research groups, working patterns and cultures within each subject. Searching techniques are significant because without them electronic information would not be retrievable and because they illustrate differences in information needs. There are important continuities in information behaviour, such as the importance of personal contacts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Whitfield, Christopher"],"dc:date":"2008-04-31","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In spite of, or perhaps because of, the realpolitik nature of the CPA and the barely disguised gross corruption of the members of the coalition government, the protagonists in the second Liberian civil war (2000–03) complied with the agreement and the peace process held. The culmination of this sequence of events was the 11 October 2005 national elections, the 8 November presidential run-off and the 16 January 2006 inauguration. In several ways, this was the African post-conflict election that broke the mould, but not just in that a woman, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, won the presidential race, and a football star, George Weah, came second. The virtual absence of transformed rebel forces or an overbearing incumbent in the electoral races, partially as a result of the CPA and NTGL, gave these polls extraordinary features in an African setting.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harris, David"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In August 1996, the fourteenth peace accord led to presidential and parliamentary elections in July of the following year. Charles Taylor and his National Patriotic Party (NPP), formed out of the original invasion force, emerged victorious with a landslide 75 per cent of the vote. Given the international reputation of Taylor as a brutal warlord whose sole aim had never wavered from the capture of power in Monrovia, Taylor\u0027s across-the-board victory appears difficult to explain. Having concluded that, despite problems and allegations, the election did seem more free and fair than not, the article examines the factors that probably influenced the electorate\u0027s choices. The results of this research show an election heavily dependent on an uncertain security situation. However, it suggests that, although a former ‘warlord’ has been rewarded, the voting was a reasoned ploy by the electorate to maximise the possibility of improved living conditions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Harris, David"],"dc:date":"1999","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It begins by locating his work within the larger debate on empire emerging today. Focusing first on Ignatieff\u0027s more general comments on empire, it suggests that his defensive case for empire is misleading: it ignores the extent to which the circumstances allegedly necessitating `new\u0027 empire are themselves a consequence of older empire, and indeed older US empire. Focusing next on Ignatieff\u0027s largely consequentialist case for the 2003 attack on Iraq, it argues that the `success\u0027 of the imperial project — to the extent that this requires the cooperation of Iraqis — will depend crucially on the motives of the imperialists. Without engaging directly with Ignatieff\u0027s work, the final section addresses some of the questions that the foregoing critique may have raised. In particular, it examines critically the claim that empires are legitimised by the public goods they provide.","bibo:AuthorList":["Rao, Rahul"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

I describe the cognitive operations that make possible both the enactment and understanding of practice by focussing on the way that received somatic information is ‘interpreted’ from the body. It is proposed that the flow of human movement, like the stream of words in an utterance, is segmentable in that it can be broken down into component actions, gestures and postures that unfold dynamically in space and time. The point of my argument is that physical practice communicates and therefore, like language, its component elements can be parsed by an observing party and acquired as mental representations by their motor domains of cognition. Motor representations yield embodied simulations of actions, or they can be systematically re-combined with the effect of producing physical imitation or novel articulations of knowledge-in-practice. Notably the compositional nature of mental representations underlies the ongoing and novel production of knowledge.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marchand, Trevor H.J."],"dc:date":"2010-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":87001,"sim:weight":0.306458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47316,"sim:weight":0.284444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222997,"sim:weight":0.281276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447791,"sim:weight":0.279431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":11127,"sim:weight":0.276912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":59326,"sim:weight":0.275762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48386,"sim:weight":0.274052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101606,"sim:weight":0.272515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6008,"sim:weight":0.272025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6024,"sim:weight":0.272025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.262117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85724,"sim:weight":0.261791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710203,"sim:weight":0.259039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710521,"sim:weight":0.258267,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.257168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352173,"sim:weight":0.256599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46580,"sim:weight":0.25508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1386225,"sim:weight":0.248291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101538,"sim:weight":0.247394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43098,"sim:weight":0.24144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Three experiments used the picture-word interference paradigm with partici- \r\npants naming picturable actions while ignoring distracters. In all three experiments, we manipulated the semantic similarity between distracters and targets (similar vs. dissimilar verbs) and the grammatical class of semantically \r\ndissimilar distracters (verbs, verbal nouns, and also nouns in Experiment 3) in addition to task demands (single word naming vs. phrase/sentence generation).

For giseigo (words mimicking voices), there is a direct resemblance(‘iconicity’) between the sound of the word and the sound it refers to; for gitaigo (words that mimic manners/states) there is a symbolic relationship (‘sound symbolism’) between the \r\nsound and the manner/state to which the word refers. While native speakers intuitively recognize these relationships, it is questionable whether speakers of other languages are able to access the meaning of Japanese mimetic words from their sounds. In the current study, we asked native English \r\nspeakers with no prior experience with the Japanese language to listen to Japanese mimetic words for laughing (giseigo) and for walking (gitaigo), and rate each word’s meaning on semantic differential scales (e.g.,“GRACEFUL-VULGAR”(laughing,“GRACEFUL-CLUMSY”(walking). We compared English and Japanese speakers’ ratings and found that English speakers construed many of the features of laughing in a similar manner as Japanese native speakers (e.g., words containing /a/ were rated as more amused, cheerful, nice and pleasant laughs). They differed only with regard to a few sound-meaning relationships of an evaluative nature (e.g., words for laughing containing /u/ were \r\nrated as more feminine and graceful, and those containing /e/ were rated as less graceful and unpleasant). In contrast, for the words referring to walking, English speakers’ ratings differed greatly from native Japanese speakers’. Native Japanese speakers rated words beginning with voiced consonants as referring to a big person walking with big strides, and words beginning with voiceless consonants as more even-paced, feminine and formal walking; English speakers were sensitive only to the relation between voiced consonants and a big person walking. Hence, some sound-meaning associations were language-specific. This study also confirmed the more conventional and lexicalized nature of the mimetic words of manner.","bibo:AuthorList":["Iwasaki, Noriko","Vinson, David P.","Vigliocco, Gabriella"],"dc:date":"2007-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631801,"sim:weight":0.388741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98933,"sim:weight":0.363608,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43937,"sim:weight":0.333471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43860,"sim:weight":0.287374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17914,"sim:weight":0.273037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17956,"sim:weight":0.257669,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.257279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99120,"sim:weight":0.256915,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43966,"sim:weight":0.25627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108341,"sim:weight":0.231342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101441,"sim:weight":0.231102,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108366,"sim:weight":0.227714,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77378,"sim:weight":0.225821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.22144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1351655,"sim:weight":0.220919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.217777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930481,"sim:weight":0.216419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.211829,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108290,"sim:weight":0.205599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.203747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In so doing, we uncover both cross-linguistically shared (possibly universal) and language-specific aspects of sound symbolism present in the Japanese mimetic words. We found that English speakers interpreted reduplicated words very similarly to Japanese speakers in many semantic dimensions (aching, bothering, continuous, affecting wide areas), suggesting the potentially universal effect of reduplication. In contrast, only Japanese speakers are consistently sensitive to voiced-voiceless consonant contrasts (associating words beginning with voiced consonants as more intense, aching, suppressing, and numbing pain). It is important to distinguish between Japanese language-specific sound symbolism and sound symbolism shared between Japanese and the learners’ first language when teaching Japanese as a second/foreign language.","bibo:AuthorList":["Iwasaki, Noriko","Vinson, David P.","Vigliocco, Gabriella","Minami, Masahiko"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1631801,"sim:weight":0.359541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108777,"sim:weight":0.350923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8998807,"sim:weight":0.318365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98727,"sim:weight":0.284308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85336,"sim:weight":0.266794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16173,"sim:weight":0.241656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47037,"sim:weight":0.239124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":42281,"sim:weight":0.221671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768579,"sim:weight":0.218182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81380,"sim:weight":0.215964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17914,"sim:weight":0.210886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108831,"sim:weight":0.209211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5768335,"sim:weight":0.208251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108366,"sim:weight":0.202257,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108519,"sim:weight":0.19472,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43936,"sim:weight":0.194188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222975,"sim:weight":0.18579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43937,"sim:weight":0.181187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81303,"sim:weight":0.180506,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.178778,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The results indicate that, while many children tended to incorrectly interpret both NP-o and NP-Ø as the agent of actions, children who correctly interpreted NP-o as patient also tended to correctly interpret NP-Ø as patient. Children in the latter group appeared to have syntactic knowledge of case-marker drop. Experiment 2 \r\nadditionally used a pseudo-particle, –u, in order to test whether children who correctly interpret NP-o and NP-Ø as patient (1) have a knowledge of morphological case (the accusative case-marker o) as well as the syntactic constraints of its drop, or (2) have partial knowledge of the case-markers and grammatical relations (along with knowledge of the syntactic constraints of case-marker drop). Results indicate that some of the children in the current study can be characterized as (2).

It illustrates that the mechanisms enabling those firms to benefit from financial globalization are more complex than the “direct” financial channels outlined in the neo-classical approach. China provides an important example in this context, as its capital market liberalization has been limited and neither the legal nor financial system is well developed. Yet micro-level evidence from China’s internationally listed enterprises indicates that innovative firms can overcome institutional thresholds, secure access to international capital, and benefit and learn from international capital markets. This can in turn induce market-level improvements through regulatory competition and demands for a more standardized system of economic regulation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tobin, Damian","Sun, Laixiang"],"dc:date":"2009-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":387372,"sim:weight":0.590434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85519,"sim:weight":0.549877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316064,"sim:weight":0.441181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447849,"sim:weight":0.427347,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90187,"sim:weight":0.4122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76124,"sim:weight":0.387356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.386526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090409,"sim:weight":0.365123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47193,"sim:weight":0.34973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48274,"sim:weight":0.346909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.342816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.341674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.335864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.335864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631884,"sim:weight":0.332673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.206439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Today, they broadly refer to themselves as śramaṇa saṅghas, or ascetic communities. While information on the history and organisation of these itinerant groups is increasingly accessible, few studies inform us on their social and geographical dynamics. To remedy this situation regarding one Jain mendicant order in India, a combined socio-demographic and network-analytical survey was conducted in 2001-2003 in Rajasthan. The aim was to supplement previously collected qualitative data on the\r\nhistory, rules and regulations, monastic division of labour\r\nand religious life of the Terāpanth, and on general demographic trends in contemporary Jaina monasticism. While Jain mendicant orders describe their own functioning\r\nin normative terms, resembling the model of rule-implementation of classical organisational sociology with a focus on values, norms, rules, commitment, hierarchy, lines\r\nof command, compliance, etc., the study aimed at an\r\nunderstanding of the social dynamics within a Jain monastic\r\ncommunity which presents itself as a limiting case\r\nof perfect social self-regulation. This report summarises key results.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter"],"dc:date":"2009-03-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2789175,"sim:weight":0.578051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

While the Babylonian and Assyrian storm-god never held the highest position among the gods, he too belongs to the group of \u0027great gods\u0027 through most periods of Mesopotamian history. Given the many cultural contacts and the longevity of traditions in the ancient Near East only a study that takes into account all relevant periods, regions and text-groups can further our understanding of the different ancient Near Eastern storm-gods. The study Wettergottgestalten Mesopotamiens und Nordsyriens by the present author (2001) tried to tackle the problems involved, basing itself primarily on the textual record and excluding the genuinely Anatolian storm-gods from the study. Given the lack of handbooks, concordances and thesauri in our field, the book is necessarily heavily burdened with materials collected for the first time. Despite comprehensive indices, the long lists and footnotes as well as the lack of an overall synthesis make the study not easily accessible, especially outside the German-speaking community. In 2003 Alberto Green published a comprehensive monograph entitled The Storm-God in the Ancient Near East whose aims are more ambitious than those of Wettergottgestalten: All regions of the ancient Near East—including a chapter on Yahwe as a storm-god—are taken into account, and both textual and iconographic sources are given equal space. Unfortunately this book, which was apparently finished and submitted to the publisher before Wettergottgestalten came to its author\u0027s attention, suffers from some serious flaws with regard to methodology, philology and the interpretation of texts and images. In presenting the following succinct overview I take the opportunity to make up for the missing synthesis in Wettergottgestalten and to provide some additions and corrections where necessary.

The problematic properties of this construction are shown to emerge naturally from a theory that defines natural language syntax as the direct reflection of how Logical Forms are built up in time as the words of a string are processed. Within this framework, all syntactic processes, including lexical actions, are defined in terms of how partial logical structures are updated. An asymmetric account of coordination is given using the concept of linked structures, whereby the (partial) analysis of a tree representing the propositional content of one clause forms the context within which another is constructed. This approach, together with the same mechanism that is used to analyze right dislocated expressions such as subject inversion in pro-drop languages, is shown to provide an analysis of Right Node Raising, under the additional assumption that the distinctive intonation pattern of the construction licenses the postulation of segmentally empty, pronominal-like elements. The identification of the content of these is established through the analysis of the right dislocated expression where crucially the update that this provides is sensitive to the properties of the second conjunct only.","bibo:AuthorList":["Cann, Ronnie","Kempson, Ruth","Marten, Lutz","Otsuka, Masayuki"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":16269,"sim:weight":0.283932,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The written word can be described as an extension of our imagination, which\r\nsupports the notion that a book is something far greater than just a physical object. Books are connected to the memory of society, its people and their identity. It can be argued that if we fail to remember what we are, then we don’t really know who we are. Recorded history has suggested that the literal murder of books has been spurred on through\r\npolitical and religious wars, with an ulterior motive to completely eradicate a particular society.\r\n\r\nThis dissertation conducts a case study of Iraq and the ways in which professional library and information bodies collaborated, to respond to libraries damaged during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. After the US/UK led invasion in 2003 the destruction of libraries took place through\r\nbombings and planned arsonist attacks. This inevitably forced certain groups of people to be slowly wiped out forever. The study investigates the damage to the library collections and how this contributed to the genocide of Iraq’s rich cultural heritage. With these thoughts in mind, Iraq had to face the prospect of rebuilding its libraries and collections in most cases, from scratch. Both the destruction and rehabilitation stage of the project, are examined in detail. These findings can be used as a benchmark for future periods of library annihilation. The study merges together subjects that include memory, the destruction of libraries and their relation to identity and the power of the written word.","bibo:AuthorList":["Qureshi, Farzana"],"dc:date":"2009-04-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930627,"sim:weight":0.544355,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108444,"sim:weight":0.51426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109051,"sim:weight":0.507386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75606,"sim:weight":0.48068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108315,"sim:weight":0.468525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.446659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52776,"sim:weight":0.446336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.445812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.416184,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108899,"sim:weight":0.414824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76626,"sim:weight":0.413127,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108656,"sim:weight":0.410321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.403889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631811,"sim:weight":0.398084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.394545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.392845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.392845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930823,"sim:weight":0.383892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709917,"sim:weight":0.374886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108817,"sim:weight":0.373277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Scholarship to date has deployed the 1948 strike at Tôhô as a colorful anecdote of the moment when the American Occupation made clear its intent to ‘housebreak’ Japan’s militant unions. Gerteis argues that events which unfolded around the Tôhô Strike not only illustrated the changing tenor of labor relations in Occupied Japan, but also laid bare the fact that, despite the professed liberation of Japanese women, women of postwar Japan would continue to be expected to play subordinate roles in a labor movement that primarily represented the interests of men.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gerteis, Christopher","Stromquist, Shelton"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":94086,"sim:weight":0.30683,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225445,"sim:weight":0.303238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94079,"sim:weight":0.294266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94075,"sim:weight":0.285014,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76068,"sim:weight":0.28118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48648,"sim:weight":0.275138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187438,"sim:weight":0.264908,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146147,"sim:weight":0.259971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788043,"sim:weight":0.236233,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45198,"sim:weight":0.234598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383317,"sim:weight":0.228128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385375,"sim:weight":0.227212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382091,"sim:weight":0.217361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709957,"sim:weight":0.216999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46810,"sim:weight":0.215053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108193,"sim:weight":0.214825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145887,"sim:weight":0.214039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46762,"sim:weight":0.211927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.208712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.208017,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Chapter 5 survives in a single manuscript only. In spite of its poor transmission, however, on the basis of a detailed philological analysis of the Avestan language it is argued that the text provides valuable insight into the circumstances and mechanisms by which the Zoroastrian religion might have been disseminated by its religiously educated lay members. The latter could have been men, women or minor children. The Pahlavi version of this chapter is edited by Maria Macuch in the same volume.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hintze, Almut"],"dc:date":"2009-04-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1633033,"sim:weight":0.2655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75984,"sim:weight":0.236569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96409,"sim:weight":0.230869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99509,"sim:weight":0.223172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43656,"sim:weight":0.212955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43683,"sim:weight":0.205921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4150838,"sim:weight":0.201889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4178678,"sim:weight":0.199514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108200,"sim:weight":0.198454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145887,"sim:weight":0.19547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.193855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43833,"sim:weight":0.190968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.190158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381919,"sim:weight":0.189351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75552,"sim:weight":0.189192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53550,"sim:weight":0.186436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99118,"sim:weight":0.181918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880843,"sim:weight":0.181811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44409,"sim:weight":0.179942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109107,"sim:weight":0.177756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Jain\u0027s book on Mathematical Sciences in the Karma Antiquity Vol. 1 on the late 10th/early 11th century Digambara ācārya Nemicandra\u0027s work Gommaṭasāra (Jīvakāṇḍa)and Paṇḍit Ṭoḍaramala\u0027s 18th century commentary Samyagjñānacandrikā discusses current debates on the scientific content of Jain karman (action) theory. The comparison of Jaina karman theories with modern sociological theories of action and social systems theory sharpens the eye for the idiosyncracies and the blind spots of both approaches. The most striking formal similarity is that both the developed Jaina karman theory and social theory break with ordinary common sense perception by positing the real or theoretical existence of unobservable entities and processes as explanations for the changes in the phenomenal world. In this sense, both models are essentially theoretical. Yet, they are predicated on different ontologies. Social theory and karman theory explain different phenomena, or rather different aspects of the same phenomenon (action or systems of action). Professor Laxmi Chandra Jain’s pioneering work on the mathematical content of classical Jaina karman theoretical texts deals exclusively with the mathematically refined forms of what he calls the ‘karma system theoretical approach’ or the ‘biocybernetic system functionalism’ of the mathematical passages in the Digambara commentaries on the Chakkaṇḍāgama and the Kasāyapāhuḍa. The question what a unit of karma-pudgala actually represents, how this \u0027karmic matter\u0027 (a uniquely Jaina conception) is formed does not concern these proto-scientific texts themselves who simply presuppose the processes of karmic retribution and formation of karmic matter. The prologue also assesses current theories of the origins of the Jaina karman theory which are still not well understood.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Walther Schubring, for instance, wrote in his classical work The Doctrine Of The Jainas: Described After The Old Sources that the \"teaching proper\" of Jainism, which propagates monastic asceticism as the principal means of salvation, was \"scarcely affected\" by exterior changes: \"The new formations which developed to remain\", he writes, \"are nearly exclusively concerned with formalities.\"  This view was reiterated by Raymond Williams, in his book Jaina Yoga, which describes the textual prescriptions for the traditional rituals of lay Jainism, though he emphasized that the \"changelessness of Jainism is no more than a myth\": \"Admittedly there have been no spectacular changes in basic assumptions such as there were, for example, in Mahayana Buddhism. At most there have been variations in emphasis. Had Jainism, as at one time must have seemed possible, become a majority religion in southern India something akin to a Digambara Mahayana might, with continuing favourable circumstances, have emerged. But all that can be detected today are the traces of aborted developments.\" In his influential work The Jaina Path of Purification, P. S. Jaini detailed examples of the continual \u0027erosive\u0027 influence of Hindu devotionalism on almost every aspect of popular Jainism from the 5th century onwards, but restated Williams\u0027 view: \"No movement towards a more catholic viewpoint or liberalized discipline, no \"Jaina Mahayana,\" was ever allowed to develop among either the Digambaras or the Shvetambaras.\" In this chapter I will present at least one case not only of a doctrine or isolated features but of a new syncretistic religious movement which, I would argue, can legitimately be called \u0027Jaina Mahayana\u0027,  i.e. a primarily devotional form of Jainism, visibly different from the ascetic path outlined in the canonical and classical Jain scriptures,  which congenially combines Kundakunda\u0027s \u0027Digambara Mahayana\u0027 soteriology (which is in many ways closer to Shankara\u0027s Advaita Vedanta),  Samkhya ontology and classical Jain cosmology with a ritual idiom that is largely derived from popular Vaishnava devotionalism and Tantric miracle cults.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter","King, Anna S.","Brockington, John"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The ways in which this tendency manifests itself varies. The monastic economy of the Terāpanth Śvetāmbara Jain order, once a radical ascetic Jain reform movement, is nowadays mediated by a form of money of accounts based on personalised merit-books, or kalyāṇaka patras, and bonus-points, or kalyāṇakas, which allow the calculation of the value of the individual contribution of each mendicant to the common good, and an indirect trade-off between the allocation of rewards for good deeds and of penances for bad deeds through the additing or deducing of points by the head of the order. By tracing its history and analysing the current function of the kalyāṇaka patra, the article shows that, for Jain monastic jurisprudence, group service poses doctrinal problems similar to dāna, or gift-giving, for the laity, since it involves not only self-restraint but also material benefits, despite the fact that the Terāpanth explcitly rejects the doctrine of merit-making expounded by the majority of the Jain traditions. Through its innovative method of spiritual accounting the \u0027ideal economy\u0027 of the Terāpanth seeks to centrally coordinate individual and corporative purification, though the putative karmic value and the offical value of an act remain incomensurable, not unlike the substantial value of labour and its market price in modern economics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter","Qvarnström, O."],"dc:date":"2003","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2789175,"sim:weight":0.395576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788341,"sim:weight":0.302501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It appeared after a period of gestation for Xhosa literature in newspapers, at a time when missionaries were discussing the publication of books in Xhosa, but Mqhayi paid for its printing and organized its distribution. The novelette added details of setting and characterization to the biblical story to encourage the youth to gather behind black leaders who lacked support. Caught in the social tension between Xhosa and Mfengu, USamson was heavily criticized by I. W.

Specifically it focuses on the case of the nomadic Gaddi\r\nshepherds and official attempts to regulate their access to grazing pastures in the Indian Himalayas. It is often predicted that the increased presence of the modern state critically undermines locally appropriate and community-based resource management arrangements. Drawing on the work of Pauline Peters and Francis Cleaver, I identify key instances of socially embedded ‘common’ management institutions and explain the evolution of these arrangements\r\nthrough dynamic interactions between individuals, communities and the agents of the state. Through describing the ‘living space’ of Gaddi shepherds across the annual cycle of nomadic migration with their flocks I explore the\r\nways in which they have been able to creatively reinterpret external interventions, and suggest how contemporary arrangements for accessing pasture at different moments of the annual cycle involve complex combinations of the\r\nformal and the informal, the ‘traditional’ and the ‘modern’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Axelby, Richard"],"dc:date":"2007-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":176811,"sim:weight":0.494941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43479,"sim:weight":0.467564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6199830,"sim:weight":0.459316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43702,"sim:weight":0.456641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58802,"sim:weight":0.452836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108656,"sim:weight":0.451765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.45129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187794,"sim:weight":0.448364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.444508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43495,"sim:weight":0.431359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84871,"sim:weight":0.42998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.42925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710045,"sim:weight":0.428864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43745,"sim:weight":0.419983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187750,"sim:weight":0.411488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709917,"sim:weight":0.406012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48338,"sim:weight":0.40466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890342,"sim:weight":0.400364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794268,"sim:weight":0.398262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109154,"sim:weight":0.397008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this model, the heads (xN and xO) can license and incorporate the length of the other into their own interpretation, that is xN influences xO projections as well as its own and vice versa. This dynamism is an aspect of the whole framework and this paper in particular will show that stops and fricatives evidence a plasticity of category and that, although fricatives are simpler in structure, stops are the more primitive of the two.\r\n\r\nThis will be achieved phonologically through simply unifying the environment of application of the licensing forces within Pöchtrager\u0027s otherwise sound onset structure.

The functional distribution of these adverbial intensifiers is unusual, however, in that some are \"bipolar\", i.e., they can express opposite (minimal/maximal) values according to whether they occur in negative or positive syntactic environments, with the minimal intensifiers operating at the negative pole. An intensifier such as dàɗai, for example, can mean either \u0027never\u0027 (negative) or \u0027always\u0027 (positive), and other modifiers, e.g., atàbau, can express these same temporal meanings in addition to \u0027absolutely\u0027.

The early Buddhist archaeology, however, points to multiple groups and spreads far beyond the Irrawaddy drainage system. The Mon typology has profitably been unravelled in Aung-Thwin’s controversial study (2005), but, while his advocacy of the Pyu primacy has been questioned, rudimentary definitions of the first millennium C.E. ‘Pyu culture’ have remained largely unchallenged. The blinkered results of text primacy in defining ethnicity and cultural identity are addressed here, with data from recent discoveries used to identify a relational engagement between the brick walls and terracotta urns typical of early Buddhist cultures in Upper Burma. This localised integration of spatial and spiritual factors is further strengthened by a range of artefacts and indigenous texts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, Elizabeth"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":2790649,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Monographs","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Microfinance and Gender Empowerment","bibo:abstract":"In the past 30 years, micro�nance has carried many promises of social and economic transformation, with the shift towards targeting women being seen as a major strategic move through which the promise of social development could be most e¤ectively delivered. However, ethnographic studies have shown that many women relinquish the use of their loans to male members of the household, belying the empowering promise of micro�nance. We propose a simple model of household bargaining to examine how providing women with credit a¤ects production and decision-making power in the household. In particular, we allow for cooperative endeavours in production between the husband and the wife and the possibility of investing a loan in such endeavours. We show that the introduction of a microcredit programme is likely to have widely heterogeneous impacts, and can adversely a¤ect the bargaining power of some women. We demonstrate that access to credit allows a woman to strengthen her bargaining position through an expansion of her autonomous activities (the causal mechanism hoped for) only in a limited number of cases: when she is able to invest her new capital pro�tably in an autonomous activity, and her husband has no alternative activity in which the same capital would generate comparable returns, or lacks the power to overrule her preferred investment choice. The two cases in which it is most likely that the availability of credit would enable the woman to strengthen her bargaining position within the household are (i) when capital can be invested in a cooperative activity to which both spouses contribute in an important way, and (ii) when a large share of the household budget is devoted to expenditures on household public goods.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ngo, Thi Minh","Wahhaj, Zaki"],"dc:date":"2009-12-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}
{"identifier":2790679,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Book Chapters","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Power and Insight in Jaina Discourse","bibo:abstract":"The essay sets out a programme for the sociolinguistic study of Jain discourse by investigating the question how non-distorted communication takes place in hierarchical structures. The focus is on the role of power in processes of indirect communication. It is addressed by comparing two contrasting models of ideal communication, both serving as measures for distorted communication. On the one hand, Habermas’ dialogical model of the ‘ideal speech situation’, that is, normative orientations presupposed by anyone who wishes to communicate, and, on the other hand, the Jain theory of speaking, which, at first sight, seems to be predicated on particularistic hierarchical, or subject oriented, rather than egalitarian, or intersubjective, normative presuppositions. The comparison focuses on the analysis of the pragmatics of ambiguous speech and the \u0027expolitation of conversational implicatures\u0027 in the Jain scriptures with reference to general norms of Jain discourse and to the fourfold bhāṣā-gupti/mano-gupti in the early canonical Āyāra in particular, the equivalent of the  catuṣ-koṭi of Buddhist logic. It is argued that consensus-orientation in Habermas\u0027 model and orientation toward non-violence in the Jain model are mutually implicated conditions of any universalistic discourse ethic. The analysis of the socio-cultural reasons for stressing non-violence rather than consensus throws a new light on the pragmatics of both Jain discourse and Jain perspectivist logic, and opens new perspectives for theoretical understanding of Jain-Hindu syncretism and strategic group formation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter","Balcerowicz, Piotr"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2790839,"sim:weight":0.778076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2792576,"sim:weight":0.712221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2783522,"sim:weight":0.670702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2787672,"sim:weight":0.642405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2789175,"sim:weight":0.548913,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108167,"sim:weight":0.534561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2786490,"sim:weight":0.523588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6228,"sim:weight":0.514673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43861,"sim:weight":0.495832,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931006,"sim:weight":0.480174,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45258,"sim:weight":0.466536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2786631,"sim:weight":0.450118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2783520,"sim:weight":0.44718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2786473,"sim:weight":0.42298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":674,"sim:weight":0.419919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74388,"sim:weight":0.412076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43359,"sim:weight":0.399697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":723727,"sim:weight":0.398777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":72959,"sim:weight":0.396961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2786476,"sim:weight":0.389544,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Following a broad-based and multidisciplinary widener’s approach, the paper explores the strategic aspects of the migration of the Taiwanese semiconductor industry to China as part of the globalisation\r\nprocesses. Based on a triangulation of interviews and secondary data analysed thus far, the paper first explores the drivers of industry migration and the means by which Taiwanese state regulations are violated by related business\r\noperations. It then contends that these profit-driven activities have triggered multi-layered strategic challenges for Taiwan and the USA involving technological and defence security. Four inter-linked aspects of the strategic ramifications are analysed: (1) industrial base concerns; (2) technological risks associated with the dual-use nature of chip technology and the foreign supply of critical chips; (3) concerns reinforced by mainland Chinese institutional reforms and perceptions; (4) risks reinforced by the Taiwan factor. The paper concludes by calling for an embrace of a widener’s approach to the study of security.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chu, Ming-chin Monique"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99004,"sim:weight":0.352173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187620,"sim:weight":0.331375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381926,"sim:weight":0.312292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2785356,"sim:weight":0.297114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1387004,"sim:weight":0.268045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187438,"sim:weight":0.254013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383524,"sim:weight":0.24892,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43016,"sim:weight":0.236786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48269,"sim:weight":0.232716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187712,"sim:weight":0.232087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382823,"sim:weight":0.224721,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45224,"sim:weight":0.218097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929825,"sim:weight":0.216735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.207193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.207193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.207193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.207193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.207193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.207193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.207193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The first aim is to reflect upon the changing narrative structure of\r\nsuch anecdotes in texts ranging from the universal chronicle of al-Ṭabarī (d. 310/923) to the regional chronicle of al-Maqrīzī (d. 845/1442). The article’s second concern is to evaluate the plurality of meanings that\r\nemerged from these changes. This discussion is then linked to detailed consideration of the authors’ social contexts, with particular focus on that of al-Maqrīzī. The nexus between literary approach and social history that is proposed here offers a deeper understanding of the function of narrative resources that moved from text to text.

Many originally anti-iconic traditions came to accept and worship certain aniconic images, such as relic shrines, empty thrones or stylised footprint images, that is, real or simulated relics of contact, and hence have become, to varying degrees, “image-worshipping” traditions in their need and desire to establish networks of abodes and of sacred sites, whether labelled tīrtha, dhām or aitihāsik sthal. A problem for the cult of the multi-shrined necropolis is that it invokes primarily the example, values and powers of a particular deceased mendicant and of his or her lineage or monastic order, not of the Jaina tradition in general. This limits the potential for symbolic universalisation within the aniconic traditions and draws them back towards either idol-worship or imageless meditation – or both as the example of a new ecumenical shrine featuring for the first time multiple three-dimensional portrait statues of prominent Sthānakavāsī mendicants in the Panjab shows. Only in combination with representations of the Namaskāra Mantra, the \"Jaina prayer\", can relic shrines, footprint images or photographs of individual Jaina saints can gain universal appeal.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter"],"dc:date":"2010-03-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2786490,"sim:weight":0.690077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2789175,"sim:weight":0.436951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43665,"sim:weight":0.378817,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108403,"sim:weight":0.363479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2787672,"sim:weight":0.35898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176844,"sim:weight":0.348924,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85842,"sim:weight":0.344599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880843,"sim:weight":0.336125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768007,"sim:weight":0.335089,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108685,"sim:weight":0.333396,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.333082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.315523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108609,"sim:weight":0.314511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101260,"sim:weight":0.30632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382010,"sim:weight":0.30369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145840,"sim:weight":0.298707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90566,"sim:weight":0.297961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710201,"sim:weight":0.293106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46774,"sim:weight":0.287573,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890342,"sim:weight":0.28682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Spatial analysis of traditional archival sources and secondary literature demonstrates that our historical knowledge of child labour is narrowly focused on the colony’s most ‘colonial’ spaces and institutions. This article uses a novel set of sources – primarily autobiographies and probation records – to begin filling in the epistemological void surrounding the use of child labour in the domestic economy. Spatial analysis of these sources reveals that children were vital economic actors at scales ranging from the hearth and the household, to the town and the region. Child labour was used within the household to produce directly and to increase the mobility of more productive adults. Child labour was also key to the articulation of the household to wider economic spaces. The colonial period saw dramatic spatial changes in the use of child labour. Children began to work in new places, in new ways and at a greater distance from their natal household – these processes shed light on how the socio-economic and geopolitical reshaping of West Africa impacted upon the everyday lives of individual children.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lord, Jack"],"dc:date":"2010-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45893,"sim:weight":0.658777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383345,"sim:weight":0.636881,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77112,"sim:weight":0.591297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76703,"sim:weight":0.50986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43342,"sim:weight":0.494118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47319,"sim:weight":0.445964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77488,"sim:weight":0.437668,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108244,"sim:weight":0.434964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187794,"sim:weight":0.434492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.428262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108460,"sim:weight":0.423015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447739,"sim:weight":0.40716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930473,"sim:weight":0.4063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2780871,"sim:weight":0.405902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43479,"sim:weight":0.405447,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.403939,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890342,"sim:weight":0.400759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382042,"sim:weight":0.400141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930888,"sim:weight":0.399957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48392,"sim:weight":0.39864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Normative principles such as this\r\nare constitutive for Jain discourse to the extent that they are used by speech communities, both to generate and to interpret speech. The precise implications of the maxim of truthfulness for language usage are specified in form of a distinction of four types or ‘species’ of speech, bhāsā-jāya \u003cbhāṣā-jāta\u003e, which are at the centre of the Jain theory of discourse, supplemented by context-sensitive rules for proper ways of speaking, and examples.

Gerteis argues that events which unfolded around the Tôhô Strike not only illustrated the changing tenor of labor relations in Occupied Japan, but also laid bare the fact that, despite the professed liberation of Japanese women, women of postwar Japan would continue to be expected to play subordinate roles in a labor movement that primarily represented the interests of men.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gerteis, Christopher","Stromquist, Shelton"],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":94086,"sim:weight":0.304677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225445,"sim:weight":0.301273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94079,"sim:weight":0.292164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94075,"sim:weight":0.282871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48648,"sim:weight":0.273531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586634,"sim:weight":0.270308,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187438,"sim:weight":0.262501,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586351,"sim:weight":0.258156,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146147,"sim:weight":0.253527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45198,"sim:weight":0.23244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383317,"sim:weight":0.225454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":385375,"sim:weight":0.224524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709957,"sim:weight":0.213713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108193,"sim:weight":0.212071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46810,"sim:weight":0.211633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145887,"sim:weight":0.211477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46762,"sim:weight":0.208211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":26301,"sim:weight":0.205605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54398,"sim:weight":0.20552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4186613,"sim:weight":0.20229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A trustworthy digital repository is one that can demonstrate that it provides reliable long-term access to digital information resources to its user community, now and into the future.  \r\n\r\nThe repository was assessed, using the Digital Repository Audit Method Based on Risk Assessment (DRAMBORA), and a risk register produced.  The assessment highlighted several areas that must be improved before the repository can be deemed trustworthy – primarily the development of a comprehensive set of policies and procedures, a mechanism for their regular review, and active engagement with the user community to ensure that the repository meets their needs.\r\n\r\nOne of the key measures of success of a repository is the deposit of materials. SOAS Research Online contains both full text papers and metadata only (descriptive) records of research carried out by SOAS staff members.  It was formally launched in 2008 and deposit of metadata only records has grown rapidly since the launch. However, deposit of full-text articles has been much slower.  A questionnaire was circulated to SOAS academics in order to better understand the reasons for this.  It was found that many academics found the repository too time consuming and difficult to use, and there is some confusion and concern over copyright infringement and publishers’ policies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Tate, Joanna"],"dc:date":"2010-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8932081,"sim:weight":0.504327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8933614,"sim:weight":0.487206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931526,"sim:weight":0.440821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732144,"sim:weight":0.435261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98273,"sim:weight":0.411281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934301,"sim:weight":0.389565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98011,"sim:weight":0.381449,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":381719,"sim:weight":0.375046,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98343,"sim:weight":0.34169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17897,"sim:weight":0.324345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8934700,"sim:weight":0.314097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8931390,"sim:weight":0.308042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14015,"sim:weight":0.283698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5491,"sim:weight":0.257465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98180,"sim:weight":0.245676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5482,"sim:weight":0.194528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98174,"sim:weight":0.186199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5507,"sim:weight":0.178034,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8930950,"sim:weight":0.174729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8932026,"sim:weight":0.154772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":2791012,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Articles","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Democratisation of Candidate Selection in Taiwanese Political Parties","bibo:abstract":"This research attempts to tackle two of the principle questions prominent in the literature on candidate selection; namely how to classify candidate selection methods and how to explain change in candidate selection methods adopted. In other words, this is a detailed analysis of how and why Taiwanese candidate selection procedures have been adjusted since the late 1980s. A seven-point scale has been adopted to measure the degree of democratisation in candidate selection, in which 1 equals the most open democratic nomination system, while 7 equals a nomination method dictated by the party leader. The pendulum of Taiwan\u0027s inner party democracy has swung sharply in both directions since 1989. Although the KMT and DPP have both reached their most democratic procedures for selecting legislative candidates, there have been instances of a return to authoritarian nomination methods in all major parties, and strong resistance from party leaders to delegating greater nominating power to ordinary party members or supporters. It is argued that there have been two critical forces governing the direction of change; the internal variable of factional balance of power, and the external variable of election results. Party factions and leaders have not promoted more inclusive nomination methods out of ideological motivations. Instead nomination methods have been democratized or centralized when the dominant leader or faction has viewed such changes as promoting their own interests and power. In addition, parties have altered nominations me thods either in response to poor election results or with a view to improving future election prospects.\r\n本研究將處理文獻中有關候選人選擇的兩個主要問題，分別是如何區分候選人提名方法以及解釋為何不同的候選人提名方式的演變以及被採行。簡言之，本研究詳述在1980年代後期台灣的候選人提名程序如何以及為何調整。本研究採用七點的量表分析政黨提名民主化的程度，其中，以1代表最開放的候選人提名方法，7代表直接由政黨領袖提名。台灣政黨的黨內民主自1989年以來劇烈擺盪。雖然民進黨與國民黨在立法委員提名上已經達到各自最民主的階段，不過兩個主要政黨也出現重新採用最威權的提名方式，且政黨領袖強烈抗拒將提名權下放給黨員或是支持者。 論者或謂主宰改變有兩個因素：黨內為各派系的權力平衡，黨外則為選舉結果。黨內派系或是政黨領袖不會因為意識型態的動機而推動更具民主的提名方式，不過，卻可能因為政黨內主要領袖與派系的各自利益或是權力，改而推動更為民主或是集權的提名方式。此外，政黨也會因為選舉結果不理想或是改善未來選舉的前景而改變提名方式。","bibo:AuthorList":["Fell, Dafydd"],"dc:date":"2006-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

For each industry I measure vertical FDI share as a ratio of exports to a parent country relative to local sales by foreign affiliates. Using a panel sample from 1989 to 1999, 1 find that FDI activities of US multinationals in industries with higher share of vertical FDI respond disproportionately more to negative effects of macro-level demand, supply, and sovereign risks. However, when institutional quality and total FDI share of the host country are sufficiently low, the merits of cross-industry vertical versus horizontal FDI in response to macro risks disappear.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jinjarak, Yothin"],"dc:date":"2007-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Two recent announcements have, however, served as a warning to the extent of progress. The most recent is President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf’s declaration that she will, despite previous statements to the  contrary, stand for re-election in 2011 due to shortcomings in progress. The announcement preceding Johnson-Sirleaf’s was made in the form of the report of the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). It recommended that Johnson-Sirleaf, and indeed many others accused of involvement in the war, should be barred from public office for the next 30 years, and still more should stand trial on charges of war crimes. Four important questions arise. First, what was the mandate and findings of the TRC? Second, how has Liberia and the wider international community reacted to the final report? Third, has the TRC fulfilled its mandate and contributed\r\nto a process of reconciliation? Finally, and in a much broader sense, where does the TRC stand relative to the much wider liberal peace model?","bibo:AuthorList":["Harris, David","Lappin, Richard"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

This study finds that the reliance of imports on trade credits varies across regions and income: towards the end of the 1990s, the trade credits to imports ratio ranged from 0.20 for East Asia \u0026 the Pacific to 0.87 for Africa, and from 0.24 for high-income countries to 0.79 for low-income countries. Applying panel and cross-country estimation, we find that past trade credits help predict current imports, but past imports do not alter the future path of trade credits. Further, the positive association between trade credits and imports is larger for countries more dependent upon trade credits. The findings support the notion that countries make debt repayments to avoid any potential disruption on the line of trade credits. We also find that the trade credits penalty could materialize within less than two quarters.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jinjarak, Yothin"],"dc:date":"2007-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316611,"sim:weight":0.116655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Theory suggests that the collection efficiency is affected by political economy considerations - greater polarization and political instability would reduce the efficiency of the tax collection, and collection is impacted by structural factors affecting the ease of tax evasion (such as urbanization, agriculture share, openness). We evaluate the VAT collection efficiency (VAT revenue over the aggregate consumption divided by the standard VAT rate) in a panel of 44 countries over 1970-99. A one standard deviation increase in durability of political regime, and in the ease and fluidity of political participation, increases the VAT collection efficiency by 3.1% and 3.6%, respectively. A one standard deviation increase in urbanization, trade openness and the share of agriculture, changes the VAT collection efficiency by 12.7%, 3.9% and -4.8%, respectively. Qualitatively identical results apply for the ratio of VAT revenue to GDP divided by the standard VAT.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jinjarak, Yothin"],"dc:date":"2008-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We find a robust and strong positive association between current account deficits and the appreciation of the real estate prices/(GDP deflator). Controlling for lagged GDP/capita growth, inflation, financial depth, institution, urban population growth and the real interest rate; a one standard deviation increase of the lagged current account deficits is associated with an appreciation of the real estate prices by 10%. This real appreciation is magnified by financial depth, and mitigated by the quality of institutions. Intriguingly, the economic importance of current account variations in accounting for the real estate valuation exceeds that of the other variables, including the real interest rate and inflation. Among the OECD countries, we find evidence of a decline over time in the cross country variation of the real estate/(GDP deflator), consistent with the growing globalization of national real estate markets. Weaker patterns apply to the non-OECD countries in the aftermath of the East Asian crisis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Aizenman, Joshua","Jinjarak, Yothin"],"dc:date":"2009-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":386714,"sim:weight":0.373831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5087138,"sim:weight":0.362237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108940,"sim:weight":0.347148,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76126,"sim:weight":0.340364,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710091,"sim:weight":0.31997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573447,"sim:weight":0.317221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18209,"sim:weight":0.31546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91276,"sim:weight":0.312805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18129,"sim:weight":0.31188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187605,"sim:weight":0.301461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9427281,"sim:weight":0.281325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47178,"sim:weight":0.276584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710493,"sim:weight":0.273474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48313,"sim:weight":0.268692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.250536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.243993,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176936,"sim:weight":0.212719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.205835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.205835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.161975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper endeavours to trace the etymological history of the terms respectively. In Europe, the ‘museum’ was originated from ‘Mouseion (Μουσειόν)’, the ancient Greek temple where art objects were known to be displayed. In the Roma era, this term was translated into Latin as ‘Museum’. Given that the Roman Museum played a different role from current museums, the term is more an etymological origin rather than the functional origin of the modern institution. However, the Greco-Roman ‘museums’ had an educational role such as teaching and research which is common to the museum of today. During the Renaissance, the term, museum, started to be related to the collection of art works, and, the Ashmolean Museum in the seventeenth century England became the first example of using the term as a modern institutional concept. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, ‘Bakmoolgwan(博物館, museum)’, the\r\nterm commonly used in Korea, China and Japan, was originated from Japan in 1860 and introduced in Korea in 1876 by Ki‐Soo Kim in his book, “the Observation Report (修信使日記)”. However, the word ‘Bakmool(博物)’ was originated from the Chinese ancient literatures such as “Chun Qiu Zuo Dian (春秋左傳)”. The word ‘Bakmool(博物)’ is a combination of two words ‘extensive (博)’ and ‘matter (物)’; however, the whole word tends to mainly refer to ‘wide knowledge’ than ‘many objects’ in Chinese and Japanese. In other words, the core concept of the word ‘Bakmool (博物)’ would be ‘knowledge’ rather than ‘objects’. Therefore, given the etymology of the term, museum (博物館) should be understood in relation to knowledge than objects and the role of the museum should be emphasised in regard to ‘research and education’ rather than ‘the collection’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Suh, Won-Joo"],"dc:date":"2007-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The Renaissance project was implemented by the British government in order to enhance learning from museum experiences and embrace minority groups by supporting and re-generating regional museums in England. From 2002 to 2008, DCMS and MLA have injected 150 million Pounds to museums in nine regions in England. The core concept of the project is the \u0027Hub\u0027 which is a network of the \u0027flagship\u0027 museums in the region. First, the central government intensively supports flagship museums in that region. Then, the flagship museums, whose facilities and standard have been significantly improved through the project, help other museums in the region by training staff and supporting programme development. This way, the flagship museums have improved their facilities and developed education programmes which are suitable for their context. As a result of the project, 3.5 million students under 16, visited \u0027hub museums\u0027 and 1.2 million students attended\r\nmuseum programmes between 2005 and 2006. In 2005, the number of museum visit of the ethnic minority groups increased 18% in comparison to that of 2002. Within museums, over 580 new members of staff were recruited and over 7,000 museum staff were trained in hub museums. Throughout the project, regional museums tried to encourage local people to visit museums and enhance educational outcomes from their museum visit. According to the research by RCMG of University of Leicester, about 90% of KS2 and KS3 students responded that their museum visit was enjoyable and helpful for their school work. Besides, over 50% of the students replied that their educational motivation was improved after their museum visit. It was found that intellectual and emotional learning occurred in various dimensions as a result of their museum experience. In Korea, there is also a severe disparity in economy and cultural facilities among various regional areas. Therefore, it would be necessary for the central government as well as the local government to support the regional museums in order to enable them to design exhibitions and education programmes which meet the cultural and educational needs of the locals. The Renaissance project which preferentially supported museums in the deprived regions in order to improve cultural and educational environments of the region would be a good example to\r\nthe Korean government and museums.","bibo:AuthorList":["Suh, Won-Joo"],"dc:date":"2008-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

{"identifier":2791887,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Articles","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"The Malawi Agricultural Input Subsidy Programme: 2005-6 to 2008-9","bibo:abstract":"Malawi’s implementation of a large scale agricultural input subsidy programme in 2005/6 and subsequent years has attracted significant international interest. This paper reviews the background, processes, achievements and outcomes of the programme over the period 2005/6 to 2008/9. The very large scale disbursement of heavily subsidised fertilisers and (mainly hybrid and composite maize) seed to very large numbers of beneficiaries across the country represents a significant logistical achievement and led to significant increases in national maize production and productivity, and this has contributed to increased food availability, higher real wages and wider economic growth and poverty reduction. However the latter years of the programme have also been accompanied by very high international fertilizer prices and costs and by high maize prices, the latter undermining the programme’s food security, poverty reduction and growth benefits for the majority of Malawian farmers, who are very poor and rely on purchased maize for significant amounts of their staple food requirements. Estimated economic returns to the programme have been satisfactory, given other benefits of the programme not captured in cost benefit analysis. With substantial reductions in both prices and subsidised volumes of fertilisers in subsequent years, there is considerable scope for building on achievements to substantially raise programme effectiveness, efficiency and benefits. Any application of Malawi’s subsidy experience to other countries needs to take account of special characteristics of the Malawian maize economy and of measures needed to raise such programmes’ effectiveness and efficiency and ensure their best fit with and contribution to sustainable development policies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dorward, Andrew","Chirwa, E."],"dc:date":"2011-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2791250,"sim:weight":0.687304,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108833,"sim:weight":0.38553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.376213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.376213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316337,"sim:weight":0.360121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788824,"sim:weight":0.332187,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.284341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.280796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108670,"sim:weight":0.272485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76377,"sim:weight":0.24147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.22055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.22055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Coetzee","bibo:abstract":"This thesis examines the formative fiction of J. M. Coetzee and his first book of essays, White Writing: On the Culture of Letters in South Africa (1988). His latest novel Disgrace (1999), has already made literary history, winning Coetzee his second Booker Prize. It certainly invites new readings and links with his earlier work, which I discuss in my Introduction.\r\nI have tried to range across Coetzee’s work while heeding the structure that has emerged out of my research: long (sequential) chapters, divided into three or more sections, which discuss issues around the writing and reading of four novels - including the processes of production, publishing and reception in local South African and international terms; questions of intertextuality, authorship and colonial representations of the South African landscape - before finally closing with a reading of each novel. My scope thus more widely looks at textual proliferations, comparative ‘colonial encounters’, the imaging of the land, and what Coetzee has called the ‘Discourse of the Cape’. While the chapters on ‘The Narrative of Jacobus Coetzee’ in Dusklands (1974), In the Heart of the Country (1977) and Foe (1986) focus on colonial discourse and colonial space (on explorer narratives and travel writing, on gender and the genre of colonial pastoral), the chapter on Coetzee\u0027s 1983 Booker Prize-winner Life \u0026 Times of Michael K, like Disgrace, encompasses a more contemporary Cape landscape. Here I discuss Coetzee’s notion of the ‘provincial’ in the context of debates on the ‘national’ and ‘postcolonial’ novel in South Africa. The final chapter on Foe equally offers a balance to the South African emphasis of my thesis by looking back more broadly to British imperialism and a canon of colonial texts - from castaway and captivity narratives to the journals of Columbus, Shakespeare’s The Tempest, and the novels of Defoe.","bibo:AuthorList":["Easton, Kai"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2792053,"sim:weight":0.567068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

First, we find that the well-documented positive feedback trading is a tranquil-period phenomenon such that it is more difficult in general for emerging-market funds to attract new investment in financial panic. Second, the predictive power of flow on return is driven by a combination of price pressure and information effects in tranquil period, while the information effect dominates in financial panic. Third, the underlying co-movements or contagion of flow across the emerging-market funds influence the association between flow and return. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of accounting for state-dependent dynamics as well as cross-regional co-movements in the analysis of flow and return.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jinjarak, Yothin","Zheng, Huanhuan"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1057383,"sim:weight":0.407622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1038402,"sim:weight":0.35507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91276,"sim:weight":0.350507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1133995,"sim:weight":0.341762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45192,"sim:weight":0.339306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108940,"sim:weight":0.328621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43514,"sim:weight":0.323562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48274,"sim:weight":0.314629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710220,"sim:weight":0.313418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48313,"sim:weight":0.305786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45926,"sim:weight":0.304473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101473,"sim:weight":0.302757,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154347,"sim:weight":0.295467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47178,"sim:weight":0.288535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85519,"sim:weight":0.283835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.28367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108486,"sim:weight":0.27606,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44993,"sim:weight":0.272575,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":959268,"sim:weight":0.272404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.268622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Here we need to incoporate semantico-pragmatic explanations to accommodate more proper account on EPCs. Many different proposals to account for the case-marking patterns in EPCs in Korean so far (Park 1985, Chun 1986, Yoon 1989, Kim, Y. 1990, O\u0027Grady 1991, Yoon 1998 among others) do not concern about the fact that the EPC is not always possible even with same sentence as these proposals mainly concern about the mechanism of case agreement or case assignment within particular theoretical framework. Proper characterisation of EPC cannot be satisfactorily described without pragmatic/cognitive considerations.\r\n\tWe have shown that the notion of affectedness and contiguity is more appropriate than the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession to characterise more accurately the relationship between the PR and the PS in Korean EPCs.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yeon, Jaehoon","Yeon, Jaehoon","Kiaer, Jieun"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We have investigated the concept of ergativity from the viewpoint of linguistic typology, and claim that there is no ergativity in Korean. Korean is an accusative language, and it is unfortunate to use the term \u0027ergative\u0027 in some constructions in Korean. The term \u0027ergativity\u0027 was used morphologically to refer to the case marking on constituents of a noun phrase, and has been extended to the marking of syntactic functions by particles or adpositions. The term \u0027ergative\u0027 has also been used in a syntactic sense to apply to coreferentiality constraints on the formation of complex sentences, through coordination and subordination. In terms of the well defined use of the term, Korean has neither morphological ergativity nor syntactic ergativity. Some scholars, however, have used \u0027ergative\u0027 in further ways, that are sometimes confusing and misleading. One particular unfortunate use of the term \u0027ergative verb\u0027 has been employed in connection with pairs of sentences such as John moved the stone and The stone moved. The use of \u0027ergative\u0027 in this lexical-semantic/causative sense is quite confusing and misleading, and this misuse originated from Halliday (1967) and Lyons (1968). If the term \u0027ergative\u0027 is used in this way then every language would show \u0027ergativity\u0027. We will propose that this relationship can be better captured as either null-causative or neutral verb constructions. We have also critically reviewed works in generative linguistics in connection with the so-called \u0027ergative verb that bring about case altenations in exceptional case-marking construction, long-form negation, double subject constructions. This is another way in which the term \u0027ergative\u0027 is used which differs from the standard definition.","bibo:AuthorList":["Yeon, Jaehoon"],"dc:date":"2008-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":495963,"sim:weight":0.0956369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is a lengthy and epic poem, consisting of ten cantos, the portion relating to mainland Southeast Asia limited to a portion of the last of these. Only this portion is reproduced below. The chief utility of this information for the historian is that it helps us to understand how much, by 1572, Portuguese at home knew about the region. Some information is of special interest, such as the reference to the Gwe.\r\nThe following translation was made in 1655 by Richard Fanshaw and printed in London for Humphrey Moseley at the Prince’s Arms in St. Paul’s Church-yard. According to the translator’s preface, Fanshaw completed the translation on 1 May 1655 at Tankersley Park. The following text is derived from the British Library original (shelfmark g.11385). Other English translations include Vise Strangford’s version of 1804 (n.p.: Carpenter, BL shelfmark B28.a.31), Edward Quillinan’s version, with notes by John Adamson, of 1853 (n.p.: Edward Moxon, BL shelfmark x15/3449), William Julius Mickie’s 1877 edition (London: George Bell \u0026 Sons, BL shelfmark W53/4181), and others in the twentieth century.

This book makes a distinction between the institutions established before and after the seventeenth century, and goes on to define the pre-seventeenth century institutions which were etymologically or functionally related to the museum as ‘pseudo-museums’. Then, the book explores the development of the museum education and related discussions in Europe and America. From the Ancient times to the Renaissance, various kinds of pseudo-museums such as mouseion, temples and churches conducted the educational role of the modern museums. After Renaissance, \u0027early museums\u0027 such as \"cabinet of curiosities\" appeared. During the seventeenth century, when the Enlightenment prevailed, actual museums started to be established and museum education was initiated. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, education became the key function of the museum due to the emergence of the public museums. However, the educational function of the museum had been reduced from the early twentieth century, and in the mid-twentieth century, museum education was degraded as part of sub-function of the museum. The importance of museum education had re-emerged during the 1960s, and since the 1990s education has recovered its status as a pivotal function of the museum. In the twenty-first century, the field of museum education has been expanding in quantity and quality, and various theories and practices have been developed in order to provide greater number of visitors with broader experience in the museum. In the West, museum education has been expanded and developed, and has remained as a key function of the museum throughout the history despite the difference in content.","bibo:AuthorList":["Suh, Won-Joo"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9612934,"sim:weight":0.0942081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We discuss the teaching of particles (ga, o, wa, and the non-use of these particles) as examples of target grammar for instruction. We first review recent perspectives on grammar teaching, and discuss key features of effective grammar teaching. Subsequently, we review linguistic research on the particles ga, o, wa and the non-use of these particles, focusing on their respective functions. We suggest that ‘structured output’ elicited in meaningful, real-life contexts is an effective basis for grammar instruction that highlights the functions of target forms, and we present a sample activity plan.","bibo:AuthorList":["Iwasaki, Noriko","Sadler, Misumi"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":98578,"sim:weight":0.496015,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45395,"sim:weight":0.404293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43521,"sim:weight":0.403549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":795909,"sim:weight":0.388101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387333,"sim:weight":0.283855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81380,"sim:weight":0.282134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56158,"sim:weight":0.250255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46816,"sim:weight":0.250037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41392,"sim:weight":0.248098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155725,"sim:weight":0.246965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16173,"sim:weight":0.226081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84939,"sim:weight":0.222831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8821117,"sim:weight":0.218119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573546,"sim:weight":0.209178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48418,"sim:weight":0.208813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":361220,"sim:weight":0.205858,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47373,"sim:weight":0.197707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43997,"sim:weight":0.192707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382076,"sim:weight":0.183593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85336,"sim:weight":0.183275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It demonstrates how through the rhetorical device of ‘communicative self-reference’, where a text points at its own communicative context, a variety of different Jaina narrative genres can function as conversion stories. A standard feature of Jain narratives is that the listener to a religious discourse frquently finds him/herself in a conventional speech situation, a sermon for instance, which mirrors the narrative frame in the text, and thus facilitates identification with the conversion experiences and soteriological trajectories typically highlighted in Jains texts. The article offers a solution for the conundrum of the frequent tropes of violence in Jaina stories by arguing that these are deliberately used to force conversational implicatures on the listener for the purpose of evoking experiences of religious insight, through techniques of defamiliarization, displacement, and the violation of expectations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter","Schalk, Peter","Deeg, Max","Freiberger, Oliver","Kleine, Christoph","van Nahl, Astrid"],"dc:date":"2010-10-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2790679,"sim:weight":0.712221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2783522,"sim:weight":0.661133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2786490,"sim:weight":0.63756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2786473,"sim:weight":0.620027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2787672,"sim:weight":0.611531,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2789175,"sim:weight":0.5981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2793904,"sim:weight":0.546198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2790839,"sim:weight":0.543824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2783520,"sim:weight":0.412344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108763,"sim:weight":0.359026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108864,"sim:weight":0.348655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108685,"sim:weight":0.347781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43171,"sim:weight":0.343121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176826,"sim:weight":0.34245,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108861,"sim:weight":0.339776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86241,"sim:weight":0.338957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85594,"sim:weight":0.331392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109107,"sim:weight":0.328725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767892,"sim:weight":0.316169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108903,"sim:weight":0.316083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This book makes a distinction between the institutions established before and after the seventeenth century, and goes on to define the pre-seventeenth century institutions which were etymologically or functionally related to the museum as ‘pseudo-museums’. Then, the book explores the development of the museum education and related discussions in Europe and America. From the Ancient times to the Renaissance, various kinds of pseudo-museums such as mouseion, temples and churches conducted the educational role of the modern museums. After Renaissance, \u0027early museums\u0027 such as \"cabinet of curiosities\" appeared. During the seventeenth century, when the Enlightenment prevailed, actual museums started to be established and museum education was initiated. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, education became the key function of the museum due to the emergence of the public museums. However, the educational function of the museum had been reduced from the early twentieth century, and in the mid-twentieth century, museum education was degraded as part of sub-function of the museum. The importance of museum education had re-emerged during the 1960s, and since the 1990s education has recovered its status as a pivotal function of the museum. In the twenty-first century, the field of museum education has been expanding in quantity and quality, and various theories and practices have been developed in order to provide greater number of visitors with broader experience in the museum. In the West, museum education has been expanded and developed, and has remained as a key function of the museum throughout the history despite the difference in content.","bibo:AuthorList":["Suh, Won-Joo"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9612934,"sim:weight":0.0942081,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Therefore, many governments implement a policy which endeavours to develop a local community by establishing or expanding a museum. The local government of Basque in Spain intended to re-invigorate their city by establishing a museum. Bilbao, which once had a poor cultural legacy, gained a world-class reputation as soon as the Guggenheim Museum was built and became one of the most famous cities for its cultural and tourist attraction. Afterwards, the term \u0027Bilbao effect\u0027 was coined to describe the success of the city revival plan. The British government launched the \"Renaissance project\" in order to re-generate deprived communities in England by supporting regional museums. Regional museums which were supported by the project tried to encourage locals to visit museums and enhance educational outcomes from the museum experience. Local museums serve the community by optimising their education programmes according to the characters of the community. In Korea, it is also recommended that the government should expand their support to museums, thereby museums fulfilling the educational and cultural need of the community by developing exhibitions and education programmes. However, the most important precondition for museums to serve the community is that they should recognise themselves as part of the community and try to communicate with the community on an equal footing.","bibo:AuthorList":["Suh, Won-Joo"],"dc:date":"2010-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9612934,"sim:weight":0.0997108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A weakness of common applications of many such models, and unfortunately of much analysis, is failure to routinely also recognise and adequately describe the fundamental seasonal nature of most agricultural production and the effects of pervasive seasonal finance market failures on poor rural people’s behaviour and welfare. This is despite considerable theoretical work demonstrating the importance of seasonal financial market failures as constraints on agricultural development. A general model recognising this is presented, with graphical applications showing the potential importance of seasonal finance constraints on farm households’ behaviour and welfare .  Formal methods for allowing for the effects of seasonal finance constraints on household responses to policy and other change should be standard tools used by applied rural development economists.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dorward, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2011-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":387417,"sim:weight":0.43779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108833,"sim:weight":0.42909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2791250,"sim:weight":0.322541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788824,"sim:weight":0.311032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76377,"sim:weight":0.297904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.283511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.283511,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.250166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.241968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.234699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.205448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.205448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":12701,"sim:weight":0.122744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Two inter-related political trajectories of China’s Sudan engagement are examined here. The first concerns Beijing’s relations with the ruling National Congress party in incorporating China into its domestic politics and foreign relations amidst war in Darfur, to which Beijing has responded through a more engaged political role. The second confronts the practical limitations of China’s sovereignty doctrine and exclusive reliance upon relations with the central state. Following the peace agreement of 2005 that ended the North–South war, and motivated by political imperatives linked to investment protection concerns, China has developed new relations with the semi-autonomous Government of Southern Sudan, thus seeking to position itself to navigate Sudan’s uncertain political future.","bibo:AuthorList":["Large, Daniel"],"dc:date":"2009","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

For example, devotional songs (dāphā) sung by groups of Newar farmers in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, are regularly attributed to rāgas; but there is little explicit (i.e. verbally expressed) knowledge about rāga among the performers. The question whether the concept has any musical meaning in terms of melodic structure can only be investigated through comparative musical analysis combined with ethnographic observation. An earlier study (Grandin 1997) concluded that dāphā song melodies in one rāga share a set of characteristic melodic formulae and are thus constructed in a rāga-like way. The present study suggests that rāga-preludes sung before each dāphā song constitute melodic models that underlie song melodies. A common stock of preludes is known by different groups, but singers are not aware of this commonality. There is thus an implicit melodic system that does not depend on performers’ explicit knowledge. This situation can be understood in historical and social terms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Widdess, Richard"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The inconsistency between the severity of the food crisis and low real prices results from the use of advanced and global economy price indices to calculate real prices.  This ignores the high share of food in poor people’s expenditures and indirect effects of income growth on expenditure patterns of rich and poor consumers. Poor consumers have not experienced the same falls in real food prices as those with growing incomes and are more vulnerable to price shocks. As high and fluctuating international grain prices appear to be a feature of the current world economy, food price and policy analysis must recognise this, and develop and use different price indices that take account of differences between consumer groups.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dorward, Andrew R"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4880583,"sim:weight":0.445269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772284,"sim:weight":0.388625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45534,"sim:weight":0.37982,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108833,"sim:weight":0.350498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3103033,"sim:weight":0.334408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761104,"sim:weight":0.324198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47132,"sim:weight":0.304822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2791250,"sim:weight":0.292957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3102737,"sim:weight":0.287566,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709978,"sim:weight":0.246457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788824,"sim:weight":0.243774,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":220816,"sim:weight":0.225922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778813,"sim:weight":0.224867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1152119,"sim:weight":0.222254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710103,"sim:weight":0.214133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146073,"sim:weight":0.212628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93506,"sim:weight":0.204906,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93468,"sim:weight":0.198348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187449,"sim:weight":0.195186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43753,"sim:weight":0.194006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Food prices in world markets have gone up and down and up over the last two years, begging the important question about what should be done to reduce price volatility. Sitting behind that are questions about what is causing this price volatility. There is a major debate about the importance of financial speculation in this. The debate is complex.\r\n\r\nFirst, there are clearly major ideological issues - for example one might set out four different perspectives on this sort of activty.\r\n\r\n    *  markets are efficient and speculation (including \u0027gambling\u0027) helps with efficiency\r\n    *  markets are efficient and speculation can help but can also  harm\r\n    *  there are major problems with much of the market ideology and we need to very carefully identify where and who markets and speculation help, and where and who they harm\r\n    *  markets exclude, disempower and exploit the marginalised, the poor, the not yet born, the  environment etc.\r\n\r\nSecond, the theoretical arguments and empirical evidence on the effects of speculation on food prices are highly contentious, even within those whose views fall broadly within the second bullet point above.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, Andrew Dorward welcomes the G20\u0027s attention to food price instability, but  argues that whatever the impacts of financial markets on food prices, the best thing to do is to make food prices less likely to rise and less subject to volatility, by raising production and the stock to utilisation ratio (low stock to utlisation ratios encourage volatility and speculation).  Unfortunately the opposite trend is likely if we continue with \u0027business as usual\u0027. Policy makers should therefore look for clear multiple wins (food security, poverty reduction, vulnerability reduction, growth, environmental protection, ...) by investing in agricultural production by/ for poor and marginalised people. Unlike measures against financial speculation in food markets,  this should not be controversial, and it should be possible for rapid agreement on it.

They can be explained by drawing on Pierre Bourdieu\u0027s sociological theory in order to consider symbolic interests and the strategies employed to advance them. In both religion and nationalism, the “strategy of the prophets” relies on charisma while the “strategy of the priests” relies on cultural capital. In 20th-century Egypt, nationalism permitted intellectuals whose cultural capital was mainly secular, such as Naguib Mahfouz, to become “priests of the nation” in order to compete with the ʿulamaʾ for prestige and influence. However, it severely limited their autonomy, particularly after Nasser took power and became a successful nationalist prophet. Mahfouz\u0027s novel Al-Karnak, which explores the fate of the Nasser regime\u0027s political prisoners and the effects of Egypt\u0027s 1967 military defeat, reflects this limitation. Under a nationalist regime, the film adaptation of the novel contributed to Mahfouz\u0027s heteronomy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Geer, Benjamin"],"dc:date":"2009-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Although neoliberalism\r\npresents itself as modern and progressive, it is argued that the underlying ideologies and power agendas have their origins in the political debates of the eighteenth century and earlier. Through an analysis of neoliberalism from a world-historical and global perspective, indications are seen that the international development agenda has more to do with political and economic interests than with benevolent pro-poor development. This leads to the debate about redistribution of resources and State-led Development\r\nversus Free-market Development, which is inextricable from the discussion of Liberal Democratic Peace Theory versus Realism. From this perspective it is argued that the notion of democratic peace is used as a popular seductive rhetoric, to legitimize western military interventions and the imposition of economic policies in the name of democracy, human rights and free market economy. In this context, it is argued that neoliberalism cannot be analysed\r\nwithout also considering inherent links to imperialism and neo-colonialism, which is being resisted by pan-African movements.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hahn, Niels Stephan Cato"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108636,"sim:weight":0.580221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85692,"sim:weight":0.573193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.573038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187762,"sim:weight":0.558238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77205,"sim:weight":0.558069,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631615,"sim:weight":0.546379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187712,"sim:weight":0.52701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145159,"sim:weight":0.522121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.519754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109143,"sim:weight":0.514746,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99817,"sim:weight":0.502954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47546,"sim:weight":0.502358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43503,"sim:weight":0.49883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090434,"sim:weight":0.497591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98910,"sim:weight":0.491457,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187640,"sim:weight":0.489676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108965,"sim:weight":0.487947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930627,"sim:weight":0.483951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108817,"sim:weight":0.477597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76118,"sim:weight":0.477086,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Both Coptic and Arabic have undergone a development known as Jespersen’s Cycle (JC), whereby an original negative marker is joined by some new element to form a bipartite negative construction.\r\nThe original marker then becomes optional while the new element becomes the primary negator. We present the results of a corpus study of negation in late Coptic, showing that, at the time when Arabic speakers began to settle in Egypt, the bipartite negative construction still predominated. This being the case, we argue that native speakers of Coptic learning Arabic as a second language played a key role in\r\nthe genesis of the Arabic bipartite negative construction. More generally, we give reasons to doubt the a priori preference for internal explanations of syntactic change\r\nover those involving contact, as well as the assumption that the two are mutually exclusive. Rather, we suggest that not only purely internal but also (partially) contactinduced\r\nchange can profitably be accounted for in terms of child language acquisition leading to a change in the grammars of individual speakers.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lucas, Christopher","Lash, Elliott"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":81303,"sim:weight":0.595152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43677,"sim:weight":0.56556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794754,"sim:weight":0.559426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43353,"sim:weight":0.513404,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43312,"sim:weight":0.511828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108728,"sim:weight":0.485199,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108615,"sim:weight":0.482543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108672,"sim:weight":0.441237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661515,"sim:weight":0.413935,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108366,"sim:weight":0.407106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108930,"sim:weight":0.400697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108859,"sim:weight":0.399435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71384,"sim:weight":0.394101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43030,"sim:weight":0.387623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43268,"sim:weight":0.38546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80736,"sim:weight":0.38128,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43705,"sim:weight":0.374564,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710310,"sim:weight":0.363989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108656,"sim:weight":0.36331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2783520,"sim:weight":0.363261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In contemporary discourse the \"African child\" is most commonly portrayed as either aspiring scholar or helpless victim—images that are echoed in the fleeting appearances of children in Africanist historiography. This essay, by contrast, explores the economic aspects of childhood in the colonial periphery and paints a more complex picture of the \"African child.\" Children in the twentieth-century Gold Coast were vital economic actors and agents: at once producers, consumers, and accumulators of wealth. They remained so despite the political and commercial upheavals of the colonial period. Exploring the economic use and the social purpose of child labor illuminates both the material experience of children and their place in the household and wider society—and it sheds light, too, on the question of why both illiteracy and child labor are stubbornly persistent in modern Ghana.","bibo:AuthorList":["Lord, Jack"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Censorship prevents a full account of one\u0027s activities and destinations, and letters could take months to arrive.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis visual essay, drawn from images in his official archive at Georgetown University and from his sea-chest at home in Brighton at Lewes Crescent, focusses on the wartime correspondence of Michael Richey.  His brother Paul Richey wrote the classic account Fighter Pilot (published anonymously during the war), while Mike’s own story of the HMS Goodwill, ‘Sunk by a Mine’, won the very first Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize for Literature in 1942.\r\n\r\n\r\n Post-war, Michael Richey went on to have a distinguished career as the first director of the (Royal) Institute of Navigation, and became a legend for his single-handed sailing adventures in the famous little boat Jester.  He had signature postcards printed for his solo voyages. On the front, a black and white photograph of himself sailing the boat, on the back, the incomplete address in black type,  ‘Yacht Jester  at ______’.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a snapshot of one of the most fascinating figures in the ‘twentieth-century story’ who was also one of its most reluctant autobiographers [See Libby Purves http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/libby_purves/article6968938.ece].","bibo:AuthorList":["Easton, Kai"],"dc:date":"2011-03-13","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Old Tibetan has three first person singular pronouns ṅa, bdag, and kho-bo,  as well as three first person plural pronouns ṅed,  bdag-cag, and ḥo-skol. The second person pronouns include two singulars khyod and khyo(n)-ḥdaḥ and a plural khyed. The current study uncovers three third person pronouns kho-na, mo-na, and khoṅ-ta. Old Tibetan also has a reflexive pronoun raṅ. Through the examination of attested examples of each of these pronouns in Old Tibetan literature, this article attempts to distinguish the meanings among these diverse forms.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hill, Nathan W."],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2791087,"sim:weight":0.55473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2786637,"sim:weight":0.445741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9051485,"sim:weight":0.431481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2791276,"sim:weight":0.395416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2793528,"sim:weight":0.392292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187516,"sim:weight":0.232921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9550616,"sim:weight":0.227623,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108656,"sim:weight":0.208254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108152,"sim:weight":0.205434,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2792468,"sim:weight":0.201471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631627,"sim:weight":0.199292,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999701,"sim:weight":0.198722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890342,"sim:weight":0.189241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108502,"sim:weight":0.188336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387198,"sim:weight":0.182672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187519,"sim:weight":0.178405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77120,"sim:weight":0.170549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108504,"sim:weight":0.169507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108801,"sim:weight":0.167631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90566,"sim:weight":0.167349,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":2793514,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Articles","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Classical Islamic Discourse on the Origins of Language: Cultural Memory and the Defense of Orthodoxy","bibo:abstract":"Classical Islamic scholarship developed two principal theses on the subject of the origin of language (aṣl al-lugha). The first of these theses, commonly referred to as tawqīf, accentuated the pre-eminent role that divine agency played in the imposition of language; axiomatic within this perspective is the view that words (lafẓ pl. alfāẓ) have been assigned their meanings (maʿnā pl. maʿānī) primordially by God. Presented as something of an antithesis to this position, the second doctrine, labeled iṣṭilāḥ, predicates that language was established and evolved via a process of common convention and agreement: words together with their meanings were assigned by human beings, although both the doctrines of tawqīf and iṣṭilāḥ posit that the actual relationship between words and their assigned meanings remains entirely arbitrary, rejecting any sort of natural or conventional link between the two. Although later Islamic scholarship accepted that both theses were plausible, within the course of the 9th/10th centuries opinions on the subject were ostensibly polarized between orthodox and arch-rationalist camps with the former endorsing tawqīf and the latter iṣṭilāḥ. In the quest to achieve a conceptual defense of traditional arguments for tawqīf it was necessary for orthodox theologians to create a connective structure, as articulated through reference to remembrance, continuation, and identity, which enabled them to anchor the construct of tawqīf in a formalized way to the scriptural exegesis and emblems of orthodoxy associated with the pious ancestors. That this was successfully accomplished through references to the past would seem to confirm the role which cultural memory played in the defense of what was deemed an orthodox belief.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shah, Mustafa"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5057576,"sim:weight":0.296452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43653,"sim:weight":0.268739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108463,"sim:weight":0.266331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109151,"sim:weight":0.263051,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108328,"sim:weight":0.261326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2789722,"sim:weight":0.25622,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43701,"sim:weight":0.253351,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108397,"sim:weight":0.250463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154452,"sim:weight":0.250231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788829,"sim:weight":0.249855,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85912,"sim:weight":0.249845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447756,"sim:weight":0.2482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108931,"sim:weight":0.247755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108154,"sim:weight":0.246456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929815,"sim:weight":0.242189,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43493,"sim:weight":0.233246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145162,"sim:weight":0.229125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108815,"sim:weight":0.221781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176792,"sim:weight":0.220831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99338,"sim:weight":0.220263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

By analyzing the ways in which middle-aged male leaders of Japan’s Old Left unions perceived politically active, young blue-collar men, the chapter shows how generational conflict influenced the ways in which an increasing number of blue-collar men of all ages identified with middle-class cultural and economic forms. One result was the fracturing of the Old Left’s monopoly on class-based ideals of masculinity, which set the stage for a cascade of class and gender confusions that have shaped popular notions of ‘work’ and ‘manhood’ to the present day.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gerteis, Christopher","Frühstück , Sabine","Walthall, Anne"],"dc:date":"2011-10-01","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316069,"sim:weight":0.397914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75494,"sim:weight":0.396874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76553,"sim:weight":0.327433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890342,"sim:weight":0.308074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108033,"sim:weight":0.295331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.287515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.28058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":260768,"sim:weight":0.277831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.277831,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77878,"sim:weight":0.275104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445718,"sim:weight":0.268555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.259844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48270,"sim:weight":0.253151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386856,"sim:weight":0.248158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47236,"sim:weight":0.242969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108189,"sim:weight":0.236115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is well known that most African countries will not meet most MDGs set out in 2000 as an ambitious plan to achieve fast socio-economic progress in developing countries. This article introduces a special issue to the problematic of MDGs in Africa, progress achieved, challenges and what is missing from the MDG agenda. The article provides an overview of the situation with regards to the\r\nMDGs, with particular emphasis on the objective of reducing poverty, which is highly associated with the other MDGs. It is shown that the record in poverty reduction has been generally disappointing. Besides, the poverty reduction\r\nagenda has contributed to the fall of “grand narratives” of development and the demise of the idea of “development” as understood in the traditions of old development economics and political economy of development. The New Poverty and the MDG agendas have been relatively successful in garnering\r\nsupport to increase international assistance for basic needs in African countries, but are much less impressive in terms of achieved outcomes and their contribution to development strategies. The paper finally introduces the main contents of the special issue and some of the most salient critical points from a set of articles that critically engage with dominant discourses around MDGs in Africa.","bibo:AuthorList":["Oya, Carlos"],"dc:date":"2011-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The first part of this introduction deals with the intrinsic contradiction of labour law in which labour appeared to be a commodity to be protected from market despotism, but nonetheless as a commodity. The second part discusses the relations between formal/informal labour and labour laws by tracing the historical trajectory of modern labour law and formal forms of labour as a reference point of all the discussion about the informalisation of labour. The third part addresses the uneven development of the informalisation of labour in Asia, with particular focus on its impact on women workers. The last part of the introduction tries to draw some strategic implications of the informalisation of labour on the future of the labour movement in Asia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chang, Dae-Oup","Lee, Doris","Leong, Apo","Ofreneo, Rene","Skumaran, Anoop"],"dc:date":"2009-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

It will aim to draw connections between physical realities and the hidden relations they represent and the act of resistance by suggesting that the Separation Wall offers not only a site of resistance in a world of increasingly invisible and multi-factorial power, but that the networks of power it represents calls for specific forms of resistance.  These specific forms focus on direct action over more traditional modes of claim-making undertaken by state-based social movements premised on a liberal understanding of representative politics.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pallister-Wilkins, Polly"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2729970,"sim:weight":0.289972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090401,"sim:weight":0.255991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930622,"sim:weight":0.247196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387217,"sim:weight":0.242074,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445490,"sim:weight":0.240528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1443360,"sim:weight":0.240526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.239931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445655,"sim:weight":0.23485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764007,"sim:weight":0.229599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586597,"sim:weight":0.227266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84976,"sim:weight":0.224105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108852,"sim:weight":0.222866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931408,"sim:weight":0.222803,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43831,"sim:weight":0.222609,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.222204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5079431,"sim:weight":0.220748,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99341,"sim:weight":0.218003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45520,"sim:weight":0.215464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108970,"sim:weight":0.211744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187656,"sim:weight":0.207811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

But there is a danger in this approach that the ‘particular’ nature of ‘food insecurity’ is lost: for example, some or many individuals are deficient in specific nutrients; similarly, changes in food production in response to policy stimuli depend on the assets and aptitudes of individual farmers. This paper draws on research and experience in Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Bangladesh and Zambia and argues for ‘deconstructing food policy’: new understanding is needed of the ‘particularity’ of the supply and demand elements of food security which hitherto has not been a characteristic of development policies.\r\n\r\nThe principal point is to say that what is perceived as a big question, a macro problem, has to be broken down: analysis has to be micro - and ethical. The questions are not just ‘food security’ but ‘nutritional insecurity and vulnerability’; not only political stability but health of the poor; macro policies are important but micro policies targeting specific and local vulnerabilities and opportunities are essential…","bibo:AuthorList":["Poole, Nigel"],"dc:date":"2011-07-21","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We find that greater de facto fiscal space prior to the global crisis and lower trade openness were associated with a higher fiscal stimulus/GDP during 2009-2010 (where the de facto fiscal space is the inverse of the average tax-years it would take to repay the public debt).  Lowering the 2006 public debt/average tax base from the level of low-income countries (5.94) down to the average level of the Euro minus the Euro-area peripheral countries (1.97), was associated with a larger crisis stimulus in 2009-11 of 2.78 GDP percentage points.  Joint estimation of fiscal stimuli and exchange rate depreciations indicates that higher trade openness was associated with a smaller fiscal stimulus and a higher depreciation rate during the crisis.

The results are supportive of the globalisation hypothesis. In particular, the results show that dynamic channels and magnitudes of globalisation to domestic inflation are highly heterogeneous from country to country, that increases in trade openness could be either inflationary or deflationary, while increased imports from low-cost emerging-market economies have been mostly deflationary, and that there has been almost no direct globalisation impact as far as inflation persistence is concerned while the impact on inflation variability can be positive as well as negative. Overall, globalisation is shown to have contributed positively to the aspect of low inflation rather than that of stable inflation during the Great Moderation era.","bibo:AuthorList":["Qin, Duo","He, Xinhua"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":44680,"sim:weight":0.54618,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44392,"sim:weight":0.500113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43466,"sim:weight":0.470587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75607,"sim:weight":0.433874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45188,"sim:weight":0.422387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710091,"sim:weight":0.403808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101473,"sim:weight":0.402905,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":671209,"sim:weight":0.396223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.394995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1057383,"sim:weight":0.394898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.383671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1041560,"sim:weight":0.381194,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573447,"sim:weight":0.379783,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.375346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.374717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5083264,"sim:weight":0.368433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.36487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.36487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.36487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.36487,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":2793904,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Articles","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Burial Ad Sanctos at Jaina Sites in India","bibo:abstract":"The analysis of the process of gradual integration of religious artifacts into the originally anti-iconic protestant Jaina traditions, starting with relics of renowned saints, and the evolution of pilgrimage centres from the early nineteenth century onwards shows that it followed the same logic as proposed by the theory of aniconism for the development of anthropomorphic images in ancient India: relics, stūpas, aniconic representations, anthropomorphic iconoplastic representations. It is argued in this article that it is unlikely that extant aniconic Jaina religious art from ancient India evolved along similar lines for at least four reasons: The absence of (1) doctrinal aniconism in early Jainism,  (2) of a notable cult of the relics of the Jina, (3) of evidence for Jaina stūpas antedating anthropomorphic miniature reliefs,  and (4) of sharply demarcated Jaina sectarian traditions before the Digambara-Śvetambara split. The reputedly oldest iconographic evidence from Mathurā rather suggests a parallel evolution of iconic and aniconic representations;  with footprint/foot-images (caraṇa-pādukā) as a relatively late addition to the vocabulary of aniconic Jaina art. The apocryphal development of aniconic iconography in protestant Jaina traditions with progressive emphasis on the individual identity of renowned gurus and gurunīs of particular monastic traditions seems to replicate earlier developments in the iconic traditions which must have started in the early medieval period. The particular evolutionary sequence and selectivity of aniconic Jaina iconography with its characteristic exegetical impediments against the worship of Jina images and increasing emphasis on the practice of burial ad sanctos and cities of the dead however represents a genuine novelty not only in the history of Jainism but in Indian religious culture as a whole.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter"],"dc:date":"2011-09-17","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2786490,"sim:weight":0.740619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2792576,"sim:weight":0.546198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2786631,"sim:weight":0.497745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2789175,"sim:weight":0.459135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2790679,"sim:weight":0.362722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2787672,"sim:weight":0.32451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85842,"sim:weight":0.294176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108685,"sim:weight":0.277337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2783520,"sim:weight":0.266451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90566,"sim:weight":0.23819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2789290,"sim:weight":0.228825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48392,"sim:weight":0.226867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76769,"sim:weight":0.212104,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108526,"sim:weight":0.208197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631941,"sim:weight":0.203811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108999,"sim:weight":0.200636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47230,"sim:weight":0.18784,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2793866,"sim:weight":0.109105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In addition to regular and obligatory tense-aspect-mood inflection, Ikaan shows a range of optional morphemes in the verb which translate with adverbial meanings such as ‘just’, ‘still’, ‘again’ or ‘too’ but do not fit the category of adverbs in the language. These morphemes trigger a range of changes in the verbal affixes and the verbal root, both at the segmental and the tonal level. Neither the inflectional nor the semantic side of the tense-aspect-mood system has been described yet, and nothing has previously been written about the meaning, classification and effects of the additional adverb-like morphemes. While this paper cannot give an exhaustive description and analysis of these morphemes, it provides an overview and some preliminary hypotheses about these morphemes.","bibo:AuthorList":["Salffner, Sophie","Blench, Roger","McGill, Stuart"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43361,"sim:weight":0.497071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43353,"sim:weight":0.459183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661515,"sim:weight":0.450521,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108324,"sim:weight":0.446926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108341,"sim:weight":0.440293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44006,"sim:weight":0.413526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8763981,"sim:weight":0.405356,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43937,"sim:weight":0.402985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43541,"sim:weight":0.399262,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43030,"sim:weight":0.398052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1656150,"sim:weight":0.376971,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43268,"sim:weight":0.375512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108498,"sim:weight":0.369196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108692,"sim:weight":0.364888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43312,"sim:weight":0.355836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.340072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108386,"sim:weight":0.336586,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81499,"sim:weight":0.336547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98933,"sim:weight":0.328626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81303,"sim:weight":0.32824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":2794015,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Theses","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Tone in the phonology, lexicon and grammar of Ikaan","bibo:abstract":"This thesis investigates the forms, functions and behaviour of tone in the phonology,lexicon, morphosyntax and the phonology-grammar interfaces in Ikaan (Benue-Congo, Nigeria). The analysis is based on an annotated audio corpus of recordings from 29 speakers collected during ten months of fieldwork complemented with participant observation and informally collected data.\r\n\r\nThe study demonstrates that tone operates at a wide range of levels of linguistic analysis in Ikaan. As phonemes, tones distinguish meaning in minimal pairs and are subject to phonological rules. As morphemes, tones and tonal melodies bear meaning in inflection, derivation and reduplication. In the syntax, tones mark phrase boundaries. At the phonology-semantics interface, constructionspecific constraints on the tonal representation distinguish between predicating and referential nominal modifiers. Combined with intonation and voicing, tones distinguish between statements and morphosyntactically identical yes/no questions.\r\n\r\nThe research identifies a range of unusual tonal behaviours in Ikaan. The two tones H and L follow markedly different phonologies. In the association of lexical and grammatical tonal melodies, H must be realised whereas non-associated L are deleted. Formerly associated but de-linked L however are not deleted but remain floating. The OCP is found to apply to L but not to H. H is downstepped after floating L but not after overt L. In addition, three different locations of downstep are attested which correlate with different syntactic and semantic properties of the respective constructions. In two of these downstep locations, a leftward copying process occurs in addition to a generally applicable rightward copying process so that two directions of copying occur.\r\n\r\nThe thesis concludes by discussing the implications of the Ikaan findings for the wider theoretical discourse with respect to the status of the OCP, the directionality of spreading and the modelling of downstep.","bibo:AuthorList":["Salffner, Sophie"],"dc:date":"2010-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43541,"sim:weight":0.611776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9427212,"sim:weight":0.517525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85060,"sim:weight":0.478799,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9550666,"sim:weight":0.43636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661515,"sim:weight":0.432688,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41543,"sim:weight":0.430815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71384,"sim:weight":0.424297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9550684,"sim:weight":0.423836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9550671,"sim:weight":0.421839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":70990,"sim:weight":0.40279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41588,"sim:weight":0.401226,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9550668,"sim:weight":0.397464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43030,"sim:weight":0.395763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85064,"sim:weight":0.393417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794230,"sim:weight":0.388108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44006,"sim:weight":0.387788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2791578,"sim:weight":0.386661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187955,"sim:weight":0.382126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9949,"sim:weight":0.3785,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146082,"sim:weight":0.374646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A significant component of organized\r\nlabor’s propaganda rested on a corpus of visual media that depicted women as icons of Japanese national culture.

A scenario is defined as a coherent set of assumptions about exogenous driving forces (farm land, population, non-agricultural growth, world prices etc.), derived from the literature and own assessments. Under these assumptions, simulations with the Chinagro model analyze the price-based interaction between the supply\r\nbehavior of farmers, the demand behavior of consumers and the determination of trade flows by merchants.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes from the Baseline scenario seem reassuring in that foreign imports remain moderate relative to China’s size, though quite large as fraction of world trade. It would be possible to feed people as well as animals without excessive imports. There is even a potential for significant export flows of vegetables and fruits. Regarding concerns, the trends in per capita agricultural value added are problematic, because they stay in all regions behind per capita value added outside agriculture, albeit that they are rising steadily. This leads to growing disparity in per capita incomes within and across regions. The mounting environmental pressure from fertilizer losses and unused manure surpluses is another cause of concern. The second scenario, the Trade liberalization scenario, appears to hurt farm incomes more than it benefits them and to raise the gap with non-agriculture, also because food becomes cheaper in urban areas. Hence, it highlights the difficult choice between economic efficiency and poverty alleviation that agricultural policy makers often face. The High income growth scenario reinforces the national food self-sufficiency result of the baseline simulation. Even with meat demand higher than under the baseline, levels of imports remain manageable. The High R\u0026D scenario shows that a considerable reduction in dependence on agricultural imports is possible. However, a substantial part of the gains will accrue to consumers rather than to farmers, due to price reductions. Finally, the Enhanced irrigation scenario shows outcomes similar to those of the high R\u0026D scenario. Here also the agricultural trade balance improves and consumer welfare improves, but farmers have to cope with drops in prices, and those who do not benefit from land improvement, only experience losses through falling prices.\r\n\r\nThe present report is written at the onset of the CATSEI-project that will analyze policy packages with more specificity and detail after implementing the following model improvements. First, the impact of China’s imports and exports on world markets will be represented explicitly. Second, the developments outside agriculture in rural areas will be accounted for endogenously,\r\nparticularly to represent farm revenue from off-farm employment. Third, the trade and transportation margins between farm-gates and markets will be made dependent on the relative flexibility of the actors (farmers, processors, traders) along the chain. Finally, the various\r\ntechniques to identify more efficient and more sustainable use of scarce water and nutrients and to address health risks will appear more explicitly.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fischer, Guenther","Huang, Jikun","Keyzer, Michiel","Qiu, Huanguang","Sun, Laixiang","van Veen, Wim"],"dc:date":"2007-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.561596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":758551,"sim:weight":0.44553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1141181,"sim:weight":0.409421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99333,"sim:weight":0.372722,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98647,"sim:weight":0.348471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9002981,"sim:weight":0.330319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94154,"sim:weight":0.318141,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929365,"sim:weight":0.306972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1928322,"sim:weight":0.304516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930159,"sim:weight":0.293369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53114,"sim:weight":0.286228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":218133,"sim:weight":0.284208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710017,"sim:weight":0.27483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":199882,"sim:weight":0.272918,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15476,"sim:weight":0.267593,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999535,"sim:weight":0.267383,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77634,"sim:weight":0.266029,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50753,"sim:weight":0.265209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103281,"sim:weight":0.258808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1931336,"sim:weight":0.254489,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The main discussion begins in Chapter One with a non-linguistic introduction to the problem of looking things up, and considers in particular the hashtable and its properties. The theme is developed directly in the latter part of the chapter, and further in Chapter Two, where it is proposed not only that the hashtable is the mechanism actually used by the language faculty, but also that phonology is that mechanism. Chapter Two develops in detail a radically new theory of phonology based on this hypothesis, and examines at length its ramifications.\r\nAs a foundation for understanding how the phonological and the conceptual-semantic forms of utterances are related, we undertake a detailed study of the relationship between \"form\" and \"meaning\" in Chapter Three. We propose a general algorithm, which we claim is a real mechanism driving the acquisition of morphological knowledge, that can abstract and generalise these sorts of morphological relationships. We examine its computational properties, which are surprisingly favourable, and provide a detailed quasi-experimental case-study.\r\nBy Chapter Four, all the theoretical necessities for describing and ex- plaining what are traditionally believed to be phonological processes operating at the level of the sentence have been introduced. The chapter is used to show how the pieces of Chapters One, Two and Three fit together to tell this story. The chapter also offers some well-motivated speculation on new lines research suggested by some of the computational results obtained throughout this work, and provides a meta-level framework for the future development of a full-scale theory of syntactic function and its acquisition.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jensen, Sean"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":99732,"sim:weight":0.537288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71384,"sim:weight":0.514455,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41543,"sim:weight":0.506985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43030,"sim:weight":0.490473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86557,"sim:weight":0.460646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108366,"sim:weight":0.458759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447855,"sim:weight":0.451931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446687,"sim:weight":0.437781,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19400,"sim:weight":0.430914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108623,"sim:weight":0.418568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2733696,"sim:weight":0.404297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43268,"sim:weight":0.402522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":19401,"sim:weight":0.401868,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18454,"sim:weight":0.399412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2792468,"sim:weight":0.398535,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86896,"sim:weight":0.397124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22033,"sim:weight":0.39162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794015,"sim:weight":0.388108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69860,"sim:weight":0.384159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146082,"sim:weight":0.381178,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular it shows that the simple act of supposing extra elements to explain consonantal phenomena leads to far reaching and undesirable empirical consequences. An alternative approach is proposed which leaves the elemental inventory containing only those elements attested in both nuclei and non-nuclei. The phonetic impression of consonantism is attributed to the direct interpretation of supra-skeletal structure. Some typical textbook problems involving consonant ‘mutations’ are explored in light of this simple shift of perspective, with attractive solutions. The metatheoretical benefits of this approach are highlighted and particular areas of existing supra-skeletal theory are singled out as likely to require ‘tweaking’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jensen, Sean"],"dc:date":"1994","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

We attempt in this paper to develop a framework which is as abstract as possible (in the sense of being independent of existing theories of particular morphological or phonological structure), yet still claims to make empirically testable claims about the acquisition of morphological knowledge as manifested by a native speaker\u0027s judgements. Far from attempting to replace current theories of phonology and morphology, this framework is orthogonal to them, providing a tool for exploring the relationship between phonology and morphology independently of any particular model of phonology or morphology. The contribution these speculations claim to make is to make clear what phenomena can potentially be explained outside any theory of phonology or morphology.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jensen, Sean"],"dc:date":"2000","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

In the space of a mere three decades, this musical form spread from the lower classes and permeated the highest echelons of Brazilian society. Samba, as it is known today in Brazil, inherits its rhythmical shape from the Samba Batucado. What I suggest is that the rhythmic cell that guided Samba during its rise to the position of Brazilian national music did not appear suddenly at the end of the 1920s with the Estácio composers, it already existed in other musical forms, as a creative concept and the Brazilian national style of music was the result of, not a transformation of the first sambas recorded, but in fact, the emergence into commercial popular music of a rhythmical concept which was part of the culture of the disenfranchised ex-slaves and their immediate descendents.

At the level of policy and practice, though, the contribution of human security is questionable: it has not inspired effective protection of the population. In addition, the relationship between human security and national security, originally theorised in terms of exclusive sovereignty, has proved to be more complex.","bibo:AuthorList":["Marriage, Zoe"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Trends and trajectories in African Christian theologies on homosexuality","bibo:abstract":"Against the background of the HIV epidemic and the intense public controversy on homosexuality in African societies, this article investigates the discourses of academic African Christian theologians on homosexuality. Distinguishing some major strands in African theology, that is, inculturation, liberation, women’s and reconstruction theology, the article examines how the central concepts of culture, liberation, justice, and human rights function in these discourses. On the basis of a qualitative analysis of a large number of publications, the article shows that stances of African theologians are varying from silence and rejection to acceptance. Although many African theologians have taken up the cudgels against gay rights, some “dissident voices” break the taboo and develop more inclusive concepts of African identity and African Christianity.","bibo:AuthorList":["van Klinken, A.S.","Gunda, M.R."],"dc:date":"2012-01-23","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2790514,"sim:weight":0.47425,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383465,"sim:weight":0.258866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780118,"sim:weight":0.254532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45186,"sim:weight":0.238499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586018,"sim:weight":0.229937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633007,"sim:weight":0.22442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":97957,"sim:weight":0.220394,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197555,"sim:weight":0.212715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710496,"sim:weight":0.208005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154242,"sim:weight":0.199251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101254,"sim:weight":0.197337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445930,"sim:weight":0.194083,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176792,"sim:weight":0.1702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732991,"sim:weight":0.164335,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383682,"sim:weight":0.160962,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4181215,"sim:weight":0.159595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99058,"sim:weight":0.158752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1586351,"sim:weight":0.156071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43701,"sim:weight":0.155228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":56246,"sim:weight":0.146256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Reading \r\nthrough the lens of  community, we can be more specific: any actor is at once engaged, to different degrees \r\n(from fleeting to stable), in multiple types (whether focusing on instrumental, traditional, affective and/or \r\nbelief-based action) of  social life. I then explore a second, implicit, cornerstone of  Polanyi’s argument: that \r\nanalytical and normative approaches to economy may become disembedded from wider social life. Reading \r\nthrough the lens of  community we can again be more specific: in the transformation to a market society, the \r\nanalytical and normative approaches that are central to economic actions and interactions are confused with, \r\nand privileged over, those that are central to non-economic actions and interactions. This confusion and \r\nprivileging can have what we might call a performative effect on action and interaction. Finally, I explore \r\nPolanyi’s story of  law as a facilitator both of  disembedding movements and of  re-embedding counter- \r\nmovements. The application of  a law-and-community lens suggests some additional details of  that storyline \r\nand that there are additional plotlines to be pursued.

Palaeography and manner of inscription suggest an origin in the eighth century BC in the region known to the Neo-Assyrians as Tabal. The new text is largely incomprehensible due to its fragmentary state, as well as the fact that it contains otherwise unattested words and signs. However, in one case, a rare combination of signs persuades us to revise the reading of part of another recently published hieroglyphic document from the same period and area. The Istanbul text appears to contain a historical narrative relating to a warlike encounter.

{"identifier":2794573,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Articles","PeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Feminist Reflections on the \u0027End\u0027 of the War on Terror","bibo:abstract":"This article examines the range of arguments articulated to justify the use of force under the\r\n‘War on Terror’. The three key justifications for unilateral force directed against terrorist actors,\r\npre-emptive force, implied authorisation and the use of force to prevent terrorist actors operating\r\nfrom failed states, are demonstrated as analogous to domestic provocation excuses. As such, the\r\narticle argues the ‘end’ of the ‘War on Terror’ has been in name only as the Obama\r\nAdministration in the United States continues to develop practice in line with that of its\r\npredecessor. The analogy with domestic provocation excuses demonstrates weaknesses of\r\ncontemporary US practice and of the pre-emptive force justification. Using a feminist\r\nunderstanding of the limitations of provocation defences and of the relationship between social,\r\ncultural, political and legal norms, the legacy of the ‘War on Terror’ is demonstrated as an\r\nassertion of a limited model of security that ignores the role militaries play in women’s insecurity\r\nand which limits women’s participation through the use of sexual stereotypes. The article\r\nconcludes with a discussion of the range of feminist strategies that might be invoked to challenge\r\nthe legacy of the ‘War on Terror’.","bibo:AuthorList":["Heathcote, Gina"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

I argue that nationalism limits intellectuals’ ability to challenge social hierarchies, political authority and economic inequality, and that it has been more readily used to legitimise new forms of domination in competition with old ones. I analyse similarities between religion and nationalism, using the sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu together with cognitive linguistics. Focusing mainly on the similarities between priests and nationalist intellectuals, and secondarily between prophets and charismatic nationalist political leaders, I show that nationalism and religion are based on relatively similar concepts, which lend themselves to similar strategies for gaining credibility, recognition and moral authority. I present case studies of a few nationalist intellectuals, focusing on ones who advocated views that later became dominant. The translator and teacher Rifa‘a Rafi‘ al-Tahtawi, who was trained as a religious scholar before studying secular subjects in France, brought nationalism to Egypt by blending European nationalist concepts with centuries-old concepts from Islamic religious and literary traditions. In the early 20th century, the nationalism of intellectuals such as Muhammad Husayn Haykal enabled them to compete with men of religion for prestige and political influence, and also served particular class and professional interests. Tawfiq al-Hakim’s concept of the charismatic national leader influenced the young Gamal Abdel Nasser, who became a successful nationalist prophet and military autocrat. Ihsan ‘Abd al-Quddus articulated the concept of the nationalist martyr, who dies for his country; this concept also contributed to Nasser’s charisma. Both al-Hakim and al-Quddus arguably lost autonomy under Nasser’s regime. Al-Hakim was unable to criticise the regime until after Nasser’s death. Al-Quddus was imprisoned and tortured for advocating democracy, then became one of the most fervent supporters of Nasser’s autocracy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Geer, Benjamin"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43946,"sim:weight":0.554753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664589,"sim:weight":0.535098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108256,"sim:weight":0.533435,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9427269,"sim:weight":0.527753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":873428,"sim:weight":0.517436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9550752,"sim:weight":0.49186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43784,"sim:weight":0.484903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85255,"sim:weight":0.474835,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794225,"sim:weight":0.469845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794723,"sim:weight":0.447065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108755,"sim:weight":0.441107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107001,"sim:weight":0.424227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709904,"sim:weight":0.421143,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108122,"sim:weight":0.417711,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768083,"sim:weight":0.410553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108876,"sim:weight":0.410534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385788,"sim:weight":0.409385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":92824,"sim:weight":0.401584,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9550745,"sim:weight":0.396162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69392,"sim:weight":0.381955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Executives of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) have been intensely concerned about public perception of the company’s place in history since the early twentieth century.   Like most member companies of Japan’s twentieth century keiretsu (corporate conglomerates that included Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo), NYK regularly published, before and after the war, official histories as a means of enhancing corporate prestige and brand image as well as to ameliorate lingering memories of the organization’s links to less pleasant aspects of the recent past. As a result, company history narratives, like many tropes of national history, often obscure more than they illuminate about the corporate subject. In particular, the chapter unpacks the way in which corporate history narratives have been interwoven with philanthropic initiatives, so-called Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs, in part developed to rehabilitate corporate reputation and enhance public perception of the [private] enterprise.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gerteis, Christopher","Gerteis, Christopher","George, Timothy S."],"dc:date":"2012-12-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":691153,"sim:weight":0.356599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":548275,"sim:weight":0.341091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":363614,"sim:weight":0.305973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929874,"sim:weight":0.300385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60858,"sim:weight":0.297775,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9000059,"sim:weight":0.292695,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85702,"sim:weight":0.292117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":861644,"sim:weight":0.287543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387243,"sim:weight":0.257946,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108984,"sim:weight":0.256797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9537829,"sim:weight":0.232953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2732041,"sim:weight":0.230419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":340559,"sim:weight":0.22987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225445,"sim:weight":0.218217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46537,"sim:weight":0.213027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880843,"sim:weight":0.211667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98465,"sim:weight":0.208776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53537,"sim:weight":0.198338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45170,"sim:weight":0.196512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090812,"sim:weight":0.191048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We argue that ba- is ambiguous between an ordinary, referential class 2 marker, and an underspecified passive marker, and is disambiguated by the overt encoding of a class 2 subject, or an oblique semantic agent phrase. Under the passive interpretation, the semantic patient displays both subject-like and object-like properties, posing a problem for the analysis of argument structure in these constructions, and of subjects and objects in Bantu. In contrast, the -w- passive extension is increasingly used in contexts where the agent cannot be expressed, but also in combination with the neutro-passive extension -ik-, that is, with predicates with reduced valency, where it licenses the expression of an agent oblique phrase. We argue that the ba- passive is used in more typical passive contexts, while the -w- passive becomes increasingly restricted to more marginal grammatical contexts. The paper shows that both passive constructions are taking part in a wider grammaticalization process, in which two main functions of the passive, change of argument structure and encoding of agency, are becoming dissociated.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kula, Nancy","Marten, Lutz","Legère, Karsten","Thronell, Christina"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

Significant transboundary effects and spatially differentiated effects make it highly desirable that international regulatory mechanisms are utilised in order to arrive at effective mitigation and adaptation solutions. Yet, the different spaces that states occupy in terms of causation and effect makes agreement on what must be regulated through international mechanisms and indeed how to regulate such subject matter. Consequently, this paper proposes that legitimacy needs to be considered one of the core concerns of international climate change regulation and governance. The aim of this paper is to clarify the role of the concept of legitimacy in international climate change regulation, and to set forth a specific discursive approach aimed at identifying legitimacy-enhancing design features for internationally regulating climate change.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kaime, Thoko"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

The argument is advanced by a detailed case study in regard to debts owed by one resident, Aaron Upjohn, to another, Richard Blechynden, amidst a web of acquaintance, officialdom and law that variously ensured that the debts were honoured.

In the Berber languages of North Africa, numbers are commonly clear-cut loanwords from Arabic; some languages retain as few as one or two non-Arabic number words, while others preserve a complete inventory. Closer examination reveals differences in intensity of borrowing even within single languages, depending on the numbers\u0027 functional usage. The languages in question are closely related to one another and are all influenced by mutually comprehensible varieties of Maghrebi Arabic, allowing what amounts to a controlled experiment, with extremely similar contact situations in different areas yielding a wide spectrum of possible outcomes. Careful examination of this spectrum allows us to set up a typology of numeral borrowing in Arabic-Berber contact, showing how linguistic, social, and cognitive factors all affect the process of number borrowing and how synonymy may emerge as an unstable transitional stage in the adoption of a new system.","bibo:AuthorList":["Souag, Lameen","Hilton, Naomi","Arscott, Rachel","Barden, Katherine","Krishna, Arti","Shah, Sheena","Zellers, Meg"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2794754,"sim:weight":0.654656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105020,"sim:weight":0.449777,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43677,"sim:weight":0.39342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81303,"sim:weight":0.388258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108728,"sim:weight":0.308631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108859,"sim:weight":0.271751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108366,"sim:weight":0.254926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381990,"sim:weight":0.247762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43030,"sim:weight":0.238462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.237517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664610,"sim:weight":0.234611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.233166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5073936,"sim:weight":0.231751,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1930470,"sim:weight":0.229231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710310,"sim:weight":0.228693,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98919,"sim:weight":0.22632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108902,"sim:weight":0.225878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890342,"sim:weight":0.224794,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145327,"sim:weight":0.22333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76588,"sim:weight":0.222429,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

These share similar linguistic ecologies in many respects, and can be regarded as among the most extreme representatives of a language contact situation ongoing for centuries across the oases of the northern Sahara. This work identifies and argues for contact effects across a wide range of core morphology and syntax, using these both to shed new light on regional history and to test claims about the limits on, and expected outcomes of, contact. While reaffirming the ubiquity of pattern copying, the results encourage an expanded understanding of the role of material borrowing in grammatical contact, showing that the borrowing of functional morphemes and of paradigmatic sets of words or phrases containing them can lead to grammatical change. More generally, it confirms the uniformitarian principle that diachronic change arises through the long-term application of processes observable in synchronic language contact situations. The similarity of the sociolinguistic situations provides a close approximation to a natural controlled experiment, allowing us to pinpoint cases where differences in the original structure of the recipient language appear to have influenced its receptivity to external influence in those aspects of structure.","bibo:AuthorList":["Souag, Lameen"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2794750,"sim:weight":0.654656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43312,"sim:weight":0.570634,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2793178,"sim:weight":0.559426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81303,"sim:weight":0.547316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108187,"sim:weight":0.516164,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43353,"sim:weight":0.506927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664729,"sim:weight":0.482117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794753,"sim:weight":0.47632,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108615,"sim:weight":0.469478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":539012,"sim:weight":0.468842,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146154,"sim:weight":0.467682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108672,"sim:weight":0.447276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43030,"sim:weight":0.444348,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":69393,"sim:weight":0.443442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43268,"sim:weight":0.429206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71384,"sim:weight":0.426387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661515,"sim:weight":0.42547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108930,"sim:weight":0.423548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43360,"sim:weight":0.420538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43356,"sim:weight":0.415537,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Responses to these concerns are, however, sometimes clouded by lack of clarity about the nature of short and medium term impacts of food price changes for different people. This paper reviews both theory and empirical evidence on these impacts. It finds that theory and empirical evidence are broadly complementary and consistent, with a high degree of variability in impacts. In broad terms staple food price increases have had very serious effects on the poor in national or local economies which have experienced high food price shocks without broad based growth processes. Poor net buyers of food, in both rural and urban communities, have been most negatively affected, with limited second order benefits from high staple food prices tightening labour markets in poor rural economies. Short term impacts can be ameliorated by economic growth and, for international food price increases, by limited price transmission. Economic growth and lower domestic price transmission of high international prices in India and China have led to lower increases in global poverty, hunger and malnourishment than hunger and poverty simulations have suggested.  However these findings should not detract from the very serious impacts high food prices have had for very large numbers of very poor people in poor countries, and the need for policies and action to address this.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dorward, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2012-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2794799,"sim:weight":0.685093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2772284,"sim:weight":0.55213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108833,"sim:weight":0.521519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45534,"sim:weight":0.513744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2791250,"sim:weight":0.511807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761104,"sim:weight":0.451481,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788824,"sim:weight":0.422605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778813,"sim:weight":0.376752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.36225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.36225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43753,"sim:weight":0.357549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187449,"sim:weight":0.35533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109342,"sim:weight":0.354005,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146073,"sim:weight":0.352088,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.333219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.33216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1642896,"sim:weight":0.331401,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8780376,"sim:weight":0.327062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710013,"sim:weight":0.318927,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187499,"sim:weight":0.317502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Drawing on both theory and empirical evidence, this paper argues that fundamental impacts of agricultural productivity and food price changes on development and poverty reduction are often overlooked in current debates. This is exacerbated by a lack of relevant and accessible indicators for monitoring agricultural productivity and real food prices. Two relatively simple and widely applicable sets of indicators are proposed for policy use in monitoring agricultural productivity and food price changes.

In the discourse of  1CJain modernism 1D,  1CJainism 1D is framed not only as a  1Creligion 1D, in the sense of the new Religionswissenschaft,  but as a  1Cworld religion 1D, both by academics, colonial administrators and by western educated Jain community leaders, promoting the reformist agenda that now dominates Jain culture, especially in the global Jain Diaspora. Key aspects of these new developments are reviewed under six headings:  (1) Early history, (2) Colonialism \u0026 revivalism,  (3) Migration \u0026 world wide mission, (4) Innovative religious ideas and practices, (5) Social and political activism,  (6) Global organizations.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter","Anheier, Helmut K","Juergensmeyer, Mark"],"dc:date":"2012-04-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[]}

One film from this era, Gadis metropolis, which earned something of a reputation for its exploitation of the female body, is also notable for its lesbi, and to a lesser extent, gay storylines. This representation of alternative sexualities constitutes the particular concern of this article. The film’s producer argued that in making Gadis metropolis he sought to ‘explain the lives of lesbi’ in Indonesia. Its dominant message, however, was actually a depressing reaffirmation of popular media notions of homosexuality and of societal concerns regarding women’s sexuality generally. Analysis of contemporary press reports and reviews show that while reactions to the film initially focused on its lesbi content, by the following year it had become more of a reference for concerns about the deterioration of the quality of domestic film production. Engaging with academic\r\nstudies on Western representations of female homosexuality, this article draws on the trope of the murderous, deviant lesbian while at the same time contextualising the emergence of this image in Indonesia as a continuation of popular images of the sexually licentious woman as a threat to the moral (heterosexual) order. By comparing the film’s representations of male and female homosexuality, it is shown that there was far greater concern with the policing of female sexuality than with the gay subject position. Despite the fact that female homosexuality in Gadis\r\nmetropolis is principally situated within the ideological framework of the heterosexual viewer, however, this article contends that the film may simultaneously offer, at least for some lesbi and gay viewers, momentary spaces for communal identification.","bibo:AuthorList":["Murtagh, Ben"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":48343,"sim:weight":0.616236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15239,"sim:weight":0.588513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108197,"sim:weight":0.584823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46680,"sim:weight":0.577864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382756,"sim:weight":0.57496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.567116,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45867,"sim:weight":0.563374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1643985,"sim:weight":0.563354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98987,"sim:weight":0.552134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383850,"sim:weight":0.543909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46714,"sim:weight":0.543771,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46502,"sim:weight":0.543065,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352166,"sim:weight":0.536072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108988,"sim:weight":0.532715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48307,"sim:weight":0.532539,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43485,"sim:weight":0.527135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46611,"sim:weight":0.526578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44304,"sim:weight":0.522867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929829,"sim:weight":0.521103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108470,"sim:weight":0.518197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The liberalization of the Tanzanian economy, which started during the 1980s and was accompanied by a move to multiparty liberal democracy, has led to conflicts in the sphere of civil society. Since liberalization, influential donors have driven the state to reconstitute civil society, based on a consensual vision, where, in theory, a wide variety of associational groups participate freely in national policy-making processes. However, in practice, the donors have supported the rise to prominence of a few non-governmental organizations versed in a dominant discourse, which revolves around the concepts of partnership, participation and ownership. In contrast, trade unions, by organizing industrial action and rhetorically challenging the state’s treatment of the workforce, are regarded as a threat. They have consequently been marginalized. In responding to their marginalization, trade unions are hampered by two substantive problems: an ideological vacuum concerning perceptions of their role within civil society and structural constraints caused by lack of finance, falling membership and poor facilities.","bibo:AuthorList":["McQuinn, Mark"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9550735,"sim:weight":0.450652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41322,"sim:weight":0.438765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768028,"sim:weight":0.418036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9543487,"sim:weight":0.398387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9552828,"sim:weight":0.388474,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":249260,"sim:weight":0.380703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2232,"sim:weight":0.325214,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2677,"sim:weight":0.304103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41382,"sim:weight":0.30019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Several analyses have been proposed to account for the phenomenon of resumption in Modern Greek Relative Clauses arguing in favour of a similar treatment of gaps and resumptive pronouns, suggesting that Binder-Resumptive Dependencies are triggered by the same mechanism as Filler-Gap Dependencies. In this paper, it is argued that resumptive pronouns are the ordinary pronoun forms of the language and that they are not alternative manifestations of gaps, presenting evidence from Asudeh\u0027s (2004) criteria for Hebrew, Irish and Swedish. Following this, we propose an LFG analysis for resumption in Modern Greek pu and o opios Restrictive Relative Clauses, distinguishing between two types of Dependencies (Filler-Gap and Binder-Resumptive Dependencies), following Asudeh (2004)\u0027s treatment of the syntax of resumptives in these languages.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chatsiou, Kakia"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43268,"sim:weight":0.373857,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75418,"sim:weight":0.343448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":74313,"sim:weight":0.342191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108498,"sim:weight":0.336298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46898,"sim:weight":0.329395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661515,"sim:weight":0.328591,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":71384,"sim:weight":0.320598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108639,"sim:weight":0.317252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767914,"sim:weight":0.309188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108615,"sim:weight":0.302706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1656150,"sim:weight":0.292887,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108930,"sim:weight":0.28994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108644,"sim:weight":0.287517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43715,"sim:weight":0.282759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81308,"sim:weight":0.281337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43030,"sim:weight":0.274978,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9018476,"sim:weight":0.270615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84765,"sim:weight":0.264422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47228,"sim:weight":0.260865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108692,"sim:weight":0.251824,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It is virtually the same map, depicting a sliver-shaped land between River Jordan and the Mediterranean, two overlapping homelands in one territory. Thus, a single geo-body appears to contain two antagonistic and asymmetrical nations, locked in a bitter struggle. The article interprets the uncanny mirror-maps of Israel/Palestine by drawing on recent work in critical cartography. One approach has read maps as rhetorical claims for power and over territory; indeed, the mirror-maps of Israel/Palestine are often read as indications of maximalist territorial ambitions and hidden wishes to “wipe the other off the map”. However, this article suggests an alter- native, de-territorialised reading of political maps as “empty signifiers” of multiple meanings. Following analysis of maps as objects of performance, whose meaning depends on users and contexts, the article emphasises the ritualistic sacralisation of the Israel/Palestine map. Embedded within discourses of memory and history, maps are tools of narrating the nation, often in diasporic contexts, carrying with them vast emotional significance to both peoples. These issues were largely left unaddressed by the territorial paradigm which has dominated scholarship and political negotiations. Moving the discussion of geography beyond narrow territorial claims towards an appreciation of the richness and heterogeneity of space is crucial, yet faces formidable challenges both politically and conceptually.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wallach, Yair"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1930622,"sim:weight":0.62874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99819,"sim:weight":0.622879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2729970,"sim:weight":0.602726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710012,"sim:weight":0.591176,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84976,"sim:weight":0.565965,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764007,"sim:weight":0.546921,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154343,"sim:weight":0.526079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108970,"sim:weight":0.517428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109116,"sim:weight":0.494583,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1444841,"sim:weight":0.461263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108764,"sim:weight":0.374633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43495,"sim:weight":0.358516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2783520,"sim:weight":0.355755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.352101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43450,"sim:weight":0.349072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710310,"sim:weight":0.340256,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98488,"sim:weight":0.331947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.329673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764138,"sim:weight":0.329372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.326797,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This article goes further to argue that in moments of geopolitical upheaval, these symbolic artefacts can play a crucial role in shaping the very framework of nation- hood. This article focuses on the Middle East during World War I and its aftermath, and on British efforts to shape public opinion through the issuing of Palestine postage stamps and currency (1920–7), which were intended to convey Britain’s commitment to Zionism. Parallels are drawn to the introduction of Arab stamps and flags during the Arab Revolt (1916–18). The benefit to Zionist nation-building and ‘‘Hebrew Revival’’ is discussed, as well as the strikingly different reactions of local constituencies – Arabs and Jews – to the political message of these symbolic objects.","bibo:AuthorList":["Wallach, Yair"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2786474,"sim:weight":0.304884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8764184,"sim:weight":0.269175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710310,"sim:weight":0.268454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99207,"sim:weight":0.265517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108852,"sim:weight":0.260886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109116,"sim:weight":0.244496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768030,"sim:weight":0.244037,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99819,"sim:weight":0.230557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":584616,"sim:weight":0.21991,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":658871,"sim:weight":0.208218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43774,"sim:weight":0.20696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5075308,"sim:weight":0.206513,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1444841,"sim:weight":0.205496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2729970,"sim:weight":0.204795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108916,"sim:weight":0.202871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85458,"sim:weight":0.201911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108256,"sim:weight":0.20096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109184,"sim:weight":0.19741,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108315,"sim:weight":0.19452,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43709,"sim:weight":0.191853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In contrast, as regards the ‘moving out’ of companies from the country of incorporation, the ECJ once considered a tax law restriction against the transfer abroad of a company’s administrative seat as compatible with EC freedom of establishment (the Daily Mail case). For years, this decision has been regarded as applicable to all restrictions imposed by countries of incorporation, even the forced liquidation of the ‘emigrating’ company. This paper addresses the question whether EC freedom of establishment really allows Member States to place any limit on the ‘emigration’ of nationally registered companies. It argues that EC freedom of establishment covers the transfer of the administrative seat as well as the transfer of the registered office and, therefore, that the country of incorporation cannot liquidate ‘emigrating’ companies. In addition, it addresses the question whether a new Directive is needed to allow the transfer of a com- pany’s registered office and the identity-preserving company law changes. It argues that such a Directive is necessary to avoid legal uncertainty and to protect the interests of employees, creditors and minority shareholders, among others, who could be detrimentally affected by the ‘emigration’ of national companies.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mucciarelli, Federico M."],"dc:date":"2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108392,"sim:weight":0.56875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387165,"sim:weight":0.530717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734384,"sim:weight":0.498891,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5080256,"sim:weight":0.486919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99009,"sim:weight":0.474365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108643,"sim:weight":0.463888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98910,"sim:weight":0.450315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187821,"sim:weight":0.442963,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382025,"sim:weight":0.430273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185136,"sim:weight":0.412101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77641,"sim:weight":0.410847,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99223,"sim:weight":0.409812,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":105038,"sim:weight":0.392298,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98962,"sim:weight":0.390124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99091,"sim:weight":0.378361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225496,"sim:weight":0.3665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5078312,"sim:weight":0.366428,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090466,"sim:weight":0.364266,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090812,"sim:weight":0.342952,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5078043,"sim:weight":0.342223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

At the same time, the region 19s own energy consumption, including of electricity, has risen fast, leading to various capacity bottlenecks in the short term with recurrent electricity outages along the Gulf coast for consecutive summers at times of peak demand. In this context, it has been noteworthy that one of the GCC 19s most recent mega-project, the GCC Interconnection Grid, went online in July 2009 with its first phase. The GCC Grid is aimed at enabling the opening of a regional market for electricity, with various potential benefits for GCC electricity supply security, as well as economic benefits. In this paper, Laura El-Katiri tried answering the question to what extent intra-GCC electricity trading could potentially be part of a mid- to long term solution for the GCC states in increasing their electricity sectors 19 supply security as well as their market efficiency. She concludes that potential for commercial trade in electricity between the GCC states does exist, but various features of national electricity markets in the GCC mean this potential is likely to materialise only in the long term. Until then, the GCC Grid stays an expensive but strategically useful piece of infrastructure which may one day form the backbone of a more integrated, regional market.","bibo:AuthorList":["El-Katiri, Laura"],"dc:date":"2011-07","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8763962,"sim:weight":0.635363,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9550835,"sim:weight":0.58538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108883,"sim:weight":0.406692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108025,"sim:weight":0.405359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9427275,"sim:weight":0.399529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108651,"sim:weight":0.383589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5084151,"sim:weight":0.367415,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109143,"sim:weight":0.358948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108829,"sim:weight":0.34016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108908,"sim:weight":0.3389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108195,"sim:weight":0.338462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109132,"sim:weight":0.333391,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108539,"sim:weight":0.327004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85356,"sim:weight":0.326067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929872,"sim:weight":0.322789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46713,"sim:weight":0.319172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.316172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734370,"sim:weight":0.310001,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.308439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.305853,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It has also created a relatively egalitarian economy based on an extensive distributive system that provides Kuwaiti citizens with essential services including free healthcare, education and social security. Therefore, the most important fact about Kuwait’s oil wealth is that it has been successfully used to benefit its citizens. This feat has been achieved through a broad distributive welfare state. Nevertheless, Kuwait’s policies of rent distribution have developed in an ad hoc manner into an uncoordinated system. Some of Kuwait’s policies of rent distribution, such as subsidizing utilities and providing public employment, have resulted in substantial distortions, inefficiencies and institutional deficiencies, and thus there remains substantial scope for improvement.","bibo:AuthorList":["El-Katiri, Laura","Fattouh, Bassam","Segal, Paul"],"dc:date":"2011","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4185846,"sim:weight":0.715183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46713,"sim:weight":0.682103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1390609,"sim:weight":0.56152,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108809,"sim:weight":0.553466,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81302,"sim:weight":0.528687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108651,"sim:weight":0.51577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788824,"sim:weight":0.509106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8763962,"sim:weight":0.503277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108829,"sim:weight":0.470048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47601,"sim:weight":0.429133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45534,"sim:weight":0.426297,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664545,"sim:weight":0.415733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.414478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109342,"sim:weight":0.412488,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.405699,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.405631,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.401761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25954,"sim:weight":0.400859,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.397064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.397064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":9427275,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Monographs","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Energy Subsidies in the Arab World","bibo:abstract":"The policy of maintaining tight control of domestic energy prices has characterized the political and economic environment in most Arab countries, together with many other parts of the world, for decades. The objectives behind such a policy range from overall welfare objectives such as expanding energy access and protecting poor households’ incomes; to economic development objectives such as fostering industrial growth and smoothing domestic consumption; and to politi- cal considerations, including the distribution of oil and natural gas rents in resource-rich countries. While energy subsidies may be seen as achieving some of a country’s objectives, this paper argues they are a costly and inefficient way of doing so. Energy subsidies distort price signals, with serious implications on efficiency and the optimal allocation of resources. Energy subsidies also tend to be regressive, with high-income households and industries benefiting proportionately most from low energy prices. However, despite such adverse effects, energy subsidies constitute an important social safety net for the poor in many parts of the Arab world, and any attempts to reduce or eliminate them in the absence of compensatory programmes would lead to a decline in households’ welfare and erode the competitiveness of certain industries. Therefore, a critical factor for successful reforms will be the ability of governments to compensate their populations for the reduction or removal of subsidies through carefully designed mitigation measures that protect the poorest and assist the economy in its long-term adaptation. We argue that a reform of energy pric- ing mechanisms in the Arab world may be seen as beneficial from more than one perspective, and as offering potential paths for reform. Nevertheless, this paper recognizes that the current political climate in the region will render the reform of domestic energy prices difficult in practice, such that reform may indeed be a medium- to long-term endeavour.","bibo:AuthorList":["Fattouh, Bassam","El-Katiri, Laura"],"dc:date":"2012","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9427296,"sim:weight":0.653085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788824,"sim:weight":0.472414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45534,"sim:weight":0.458655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108651,"sim:weight":0.428802,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108883,"sim:weight":0.411491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81302,"sim:weight":0.409759,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.409477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9427273,"sim:weight":0.399529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8763962,"sim:weight":0.398503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18209,"sim:weight":0.398165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108829,"sim:weight":0.381042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.375804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381990,"sim:weight":0.375735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109342,"sim:weight":0.373515,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.365135,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.363731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4185846,"sim:weight":0.363198,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187689,"sim:weight":0.362639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.362585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.362585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We find that the size of capital flows is positively correlated with country\u0027s income level. In addition, capital flight has a non-linear relationship with the income level. Using the Hansen threshold estimation, we identify a three-stage threshold effect: for low-income countries (GDP per capita below US$ 3,000), capital flight increases as the income level rises; and only after the economy passes a threshold level (GDP per capita above US$ 5,000), capital flight declines with income. We conclude with a case study of Brazil and Korea, observing that the decisions to implement capital control measures tend to be pushed around by the feedbacks among economic growth, currency appreciation, and the global financial conditions.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ding, Ding","Jinjarak, Yothin"],"dc:date":"2012-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":4187700,"sim:weight":0.561153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":25977,"sim:weight":0.413811,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108940,"sim:weight":0.381878,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101586,"sim:weight":0.366948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187605,"sim:weight":0.366673,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573447,"sim:weight":0.361177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99318,"sim:weight":0.360525,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43514,"sim:weight":0.352047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53631,"sim:weight":0.351333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91276,"sim:weight":0.342004,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788824,"sim:weight":0.341671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386714,"sim:weight":0.33639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101473,"sim:weight":0.333517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710091,"sim:weight":0.331077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99407,"sim:weight":0.329823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43391,"sim:weight":0.309408,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44471,"sim:weight":0.304385,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3102817,"sim:weight":0.303579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3102681,"sim:weight":0.300492,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1057383,"sim:weight":0.295464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Traditionally having being seen as one of the world’s most energy rich regions, the Arab world has in recent years often been overlooked as a region which suffers severely from energy poverty itself. In 2002, about 65 million people in the Arab world had no access to electricity, and an additional 60 million were severely undersupplied in both urban and rural areas. In terms of cooking and heating, almost one-fifth of the Arab population rely on non-commercial fuels like wood, dung, and agricultural residues particularly in Comoros, Djibouti, Sudan, Yemen, and Somalia but also in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Syria. This study by Laura El-Katiri and Bassam Fattouh fills a gap in the existing literature by looking at the case of prevailing energy poverty in Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Arab world. The Yemeni case is particularly interesting because of the country’s status as a net energy exporter. Large segments of the Yemeni population both in rural and urban areas rely heavily on traditional fuels such as firewood and dung while electrification rates in Yemen is relatively low where only 54% of Yemeni households have access to electricity. Decades of underinvestment and lack of necessary infrastructure, and Yemen’s prevailing poverty problem have all contributed to this status, as has the country’s fractured political system.","bibo:AuthorList":["El-Katiri, Laura","Fattouh , Bassam"],"dc:date":"2011-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9427275,"sim:weight":0.653085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2788824,"sim:weight":0.628204,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.459743,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109342,"sim:weight":0.453733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14616,"sim:weight":0.397509,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":107786,"sim:weight":0.396897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.396805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.39538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767895,"sim:weight":0.394303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108651,"sim:weight":0.389625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.379957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.379957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.379957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.379957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.379957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.379957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.379957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.379957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.379957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.379957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
{"identifier":9427297,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Articles","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"On Oil Embargos and the Myth of the Iranian Oil Weapon","bibo:abstract":"The exchange of threats between Iran and the West vis-à-vis Iranian oil exports to European and other consumer countries has received wide attention among policy makers and analysts; IMF officials predict that crude oil prices could increase by as much as 30 percent in case of a halt of Iran’s exports to OECD countries, and if other sources don’t offset the loss of Iranian crude oil. Others claim that all the elements are set for ‘the $200 a barrel scenario’. However, this commentary offers a less pessimistic view, and argues that the potential impacts of such threats on oil market dynamics are often exaggerated. Oil embargos against individual producing countries are in reality difficult to implement, for they require a concerted effort by a large number of buyers to prevent oil producers from diverting crude oil from one market to another. Where they result in a tightening of oil markets and rising prices for consumer nations, they can be relaxed or amended. As for the use of an Iranian oil weapon, the fact remains that despite continuous threats, Iran has never used the oil weapon; the oil weapon remains an indiscriminate policy measure that all producers, including Iran, are reluctant to use; and if ever employed, it is likely to be ineffective and counterproductive from a producer’s point of view. Nevertheless, fears that governments may pursue policies to restrict the flow of energy supplies rattle markets and place a premium on the oil price and contribute to increased price volatility.","bibo:AuthorList":["El-Katiri, Laura","Fattouh , Bassam"],"dc:date":"2012-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108908,"sim:weight":0.473576,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109143,"sim:weight":0.468897,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5083241,"sim:weight":0.446698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154411,"sim:weight":0.417136,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108636,"sim:weight":0.417002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8763962,"sim:weight":0.415235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108444,"sim:weight":0.39113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108651,"sim:weight":0.380446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108883,"sim:weight":0.374072,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664535,"sim:weight":0.359186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43676,"sim:weight":0.346106,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187445,"sim:weight":0.332548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109132,"sim:weight":0.330636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108195,"sim:weight":0.328097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108817,"sim:weight":0.311042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109140,"sim:weight":0.306025,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85356,"sim:weight":0.302012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46713,"sim:weight":0.289414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090417,"sim:weight":0.277926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108965,"sim:weight":0.277728,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Our ability to address these challenges is constrained, inter alia, by weaknesses in cross disciplinary understandings of interactive processes of change in socio-ecological systems.   This paper draws on complementary insights from social and biological sciences to propose a ‘livelisystems’ framework of multi-scale, dynamic change across social and biological systems.  This describes how material, informational and relational assets, asset services and asset pathways interact in systems with embedded and emergent properties undergoing a variety of structural transformations. Related characteristics of ‘higher’ (notably human) livelisystems and change processes are identified as the greater relative importance of (a) informational, relational and extrinsic (as opposed to material and intrinsic) assets, (b) teleological  (as opposed to natural) selection, and (c) innovational (as opposed to mutational) change. The framework provides valuable insights into social and environmental challenges posed by global and local change, globalisation, poverty, modernisation, and growth in the anthropocene. Its potential for improving inter-disciplinary and multi-scale understanding is discussed, notably by examination of human adaptation to bio-diversity and eco-system service change following the spread of Lantana camera in the Western Ghats, India.","bibo:AuthorList":["Dorward, Andrew","Kent, Rebecca"],"dc:date":"2012-07-16","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58045,"sim:weight":0.515677,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.480471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":382177,"sim:weight":0.466403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.465342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.465271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.456319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.456319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.456319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.456319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.456319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.456319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.456319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.456319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.456319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.456319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.456319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.456319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.456319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.456319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53815,"sim:weight":0.453648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

According to the plaintiff, from certain specific acts of EU law (such as, among others, the mandatory bid rule provided for by the Takeover Directive) could be inferred the existence of a principle, according to which the person who purchases the control of a company should then offer to all other shareholders the same opportunity to sell their shares. The ECJ denied that such a principle can be inferred from specific provisions of derivative EU law beyond their scope of application. In addition, the ECJ has put in clear words that, in order to impose to the acquirer of corporate control a duty to purchase all outstanding shares, a specific legislative decision is required, with the aim to weight all involved interests.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mucciarelli, Federico"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":5076106,"sim:weight":0.419687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767375,"sim:weight":0.410805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5082098,"sim:weight":0.391706,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5080500,"sim:weight":0.388874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17326,"sim:weight":0.38792,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1458991,"sim:weight":0.382379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767377,"sim:weight":0.374557,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5081962,"sim:weight":0.367676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5082581,"sim:weight":0.360758,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8766335,"sim:weight":0.352075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":72069,"sim:weight":0.349278,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5079003,"sim:weight":0.336475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99091,"sim:weight":0.335211,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5075261,"sim:weight":0.331018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5082607,"sim:weight":0.325761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734384,"sim:weight":0.324507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5227508,"sim:weight":0.321416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1548574,"sim:weight":0.320659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77641,"sim:weight":0.318713,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":266706,"sim:weight":0.316676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The invasion of forest by Lantana has led to changes in the attributes and functions of four key livelihood assets: forest grazing, bamboo for basketry, palm leaf collection, and wild foods. We observe that differences in households’ and individuals’ ability to substitute important functions of lost or declining assets affects their ability to adapt to changes in resource availability and attributes. A focus on change in the attributes of key livelihood assets provides a useful lens through which to look at impacts of environmental change. Analysing changes in attributes for different user groups encourages the social effects of environmental change to be disaggregated, thus acknowledging social differentiation of impacts.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kent, Rebecca","Dorward, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2012-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":58802,"sim:weight":0.559755,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43479,"sim:weight":0.55018,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767895,"sim:weight":0.504172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2773103,"sim:weight":0.446551,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778978,"sim:weight":0.445754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794268,"sim:weight":0.444528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108833,"sim:weight":0.440514,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176811,"sim:weight":0.431954,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109092,"sim:weight":0.425343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108460,"sim:weight":0.420111,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.402325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187750,"sim:weight":0.40113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2767488,"sim:weight":0.39994,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48338,"sim:weight":0.392129,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.391191,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768028,"sim:weight":0.390451,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187716,"sim:weight":0.384133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447739,"sim:weight":0.38159,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88299,"sim:weight":0.380661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":88298,"sim:weight":0.380661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Asset based approaches have thus become central to poverty analysis and development policy. In this paper we contend that for a better understanding of the role of assets in poverty reduction processes we need to consider asset ‘functions’ in addition to asset stocks. Further, we propose that an analysis of asset ‘attributes’ (the factors that enable an asset to preform a particular function) provides a useful mechanism to examine social and other determinants of asset services.\r\nAsset services (or functions) can be also conceptualized as ecosystem services and \r\nthis presents an opportunity to integrate poverty analysis into ecosystem services frameworks. We present an Ecosystem Asset Function Framework and illustrate its potential to contribute to the analysis of the role of natural assets in poverty reduction with a case study of biodiversity change from southern India.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kent, Rebecca","Dorward, Andrew"],"dc:date":"2012-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43479,"sim:weight":0.446433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8767895,"sim:weight":0.424416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8768028,"sim:weight":0.372923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.370208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.370149,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.368536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.364975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.358324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.358324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.358324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.358324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.358324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.358324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.358324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.358324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.358324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.358324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.358324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.358324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.358324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Support for separating register-pitch and contour-pitch differences comes from three associated features, aspiration, phonation and voice: they apply to the register distinction but not to the contour distinction. Further support comes from comparing this tonal analysis with an identical analysis of a closely related language, Tamang, and also with the two-term system put forward for the word in Tibetan.","bibo:AuthorList":["Sprigg, R.

{"identifier":9550698,"ep:Repository":103,"dc:type":["Monographs","NonPeerReviewed"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Askese und Devotion: Das rituelle System der Terāpanth Śvetāmbara Jains","bibo:abstract":"Historical-philological investigations of Jaina scriptures have a more than two hundred year history. Yet, even today not much is known about the lifestyle of the Jainas or Jains. Since almost two thousand years Jinism or Jainism is split into the two denominations of Digambara and Śvetāmbara, which are internally divided into numerous independent sects and sub-sects.  The classical form of the Jaina sect is the fourfold community of a mendicant order of monks (sādhu) and nuns (sādhvī) and male śrāvaka) and female lay-followers (śrāvikā). The regionally or trans-regionally organised mendicant orders, around which lay communities have formed, are the effective social units within the Śvetāmbara tradition. Almost nothing is known about the history, the specific doctrines, forms of organisation and rituals of these groups. The present study shows that within the Śvetāmbara tradition currently three main lines of tradition exist: Mūrtipūjaka, Sthānakavāsī and Terāpanth. These are divided in about 57 independent orders. An understanding of Jinism as a lived religion is only possible through an investigation of these units. As a research programme this was first formulated by Kendall Folkert in a paper which was published posthumously in 1993. In the present study, completed in 1994 but published only now, this research strategy, independently devised by the author, is applied for the first time. The work is conceived as a multi-perspective historical ethnography of a single Jaina sub-sect. It offers a comprehensive overview of the lifestyle and organisation of the itinerant ascetics of the Terāpanth and its followers. The study is based on intermittent fieldwork in India between 1988-1992 as well as archival and literary sources. As a comparative historical study of the currently observable practices within a particular tradition, it offers a new picture of Jinism. It shows that the specific ritual system of the Terāpanth developed from 1760 onward through a series of cumulative reforms and is still constantly changing. The study of the doctrine, monastic law and the prescriptive rituals of the Terāpanth illustrates in exemplary form in which ways the presumably ‘static’ Jaina tradition evolves and changes. Transmitted canonical and post-canonical texts do not determine conduct, but serve as a pool of authoritative sources which are selectively invoked and expanded on in view of particular situations. In this way the mainly liturgical rituals and sect-specific rules of conduct of the Terāpanth have been modified again and again and adapted to changing contexts. In order to account for these new data, the study proposes to replace the Anthropological and Indological standard model of the interaction of text and practice qua value-realisation by a theory of the function of religious value-differentials, texts, discourse and ritual in time.","bibo:AuthorList":["Flügel, Peter"],"dc:date":"2012-09-15","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1146844,"sim:weight":0.831536,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13227,"sim:weight":0.818418,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41312,"sim:weight":0.753807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":13228,"sim:weight":0.74237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77083,"sim:weight":0.295738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":115059,"sim:weight":0.235642,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4270,"sim:weight":0.162258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76011,"sim:weight":0.148442,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9550752,"sim:weight":0.135235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9613132,"sim:weight":0.115543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":87068,"sim:weight":0.0914011,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5920,"sim:weight":0.0779976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106529,"sim:weight":0.0729702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5376,"sim:weight":0.0708597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5222845,"sim:weight":0.0701003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109376,"sim:weight":0.06659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9613133,"sim:weight":0.0610723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The affini-ties to Lijiashan are greater than those to the larger and more renowned cemetery of Shizhaishan. The dates of the Samon Culture overlap with the earlier Dian cemeteries. Most of the Samon finds are not found outside Myanmar, such as small wire packets, floral ornaments and \u0027mother-goddess\u0027 figures. The Samon Valley and Upper Myanmar may be the areas referred to in Chinese texts as beyond the „barbarian‟ regions that came under Han control in the early centuries CE. And, as seen in Yunnan at this time, the Samon Culture may have experienced political change reflecting Han expansion and fluctuating alliances between Myanmar, Yunnan, and South Asia.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moore, Elizabeth Howard"],"dc:date":"2010","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2788720,"sim:weight":0.570114,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2793577,"sim:weight":0.545901,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108609,"sim:weight":0.356735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":65960,"sim:weight":0.354346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710201,"sim:weight":0.347016,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109121,"sim:weight":0.340432,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43702,"sim:weight":0.336822,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2794543,"sim:weight":0.331008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90566,"sim:weight":0.318992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2768007,"sim:weight":0.313552,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108620,"sim:weight":0.309919,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108656,"sim:weight":0.307607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109075,"sim:weight":0.306242,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9025328,"sim:weight":0.303345,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109144,"sim:weight":0.295903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108464,"sim:weight":0.295122,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2792468,"sim:weight":0.291154,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43665,"sim:weight":0.289369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86193,"sim:weight":0.287725,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108666,"sim:weight":0.285284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

By investigating the contexts of the much disputed, but important, Gathic word maga-, it highlights some aspects of the Old Avestan ritual governed by the same triangular pattern of ritually enacted gift-exchange. Finally, it discusses the Gathic evidence for exchange and\r\nreciprocity in a non-ritual, religious context. It concludes that there are, in the Gathas, two distinct, but interpenetrary, exchange patterns: first, the inherited Indo-Iranian triangular model underlying the ritual activity and governing the relationship between Zarathustra and\r\nsome of his contemporaries and, secondly, a new pattern without Indo-Iranian antecedent, of a two-way relationship between any human being and Zarathustra’s god, Ahura\r\nMazda.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hintze, Almut"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2787290,"sim:weight":0.558227,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2784784,"sim:weight":0.440943,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43493,"sim:weight":0.434125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43801,"sim:weight":0.4276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43702,"sim:weight":0.427133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.423578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383557,"sim:weight":0.406032,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108502,"sim:weight":0.405342,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43520,"sim:weight":0.403419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43177,"sim:weight":0.395085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43457,"sim:weight":0.392571,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382037,"sim:weight":0.39186,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2783520,"sim:weight":0.388553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108864,"sim:weight":0.387321,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9550597,"sim:weight":0.385397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4890342,"sim:weight":0.379098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108861,"sim:weight":0.373944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387198,"sim:weight":0.370286,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43665,"sim:weight":0.368093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109153,"sim:weight":0.367071,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This means that the vast majority of East Asian population now have to make and reproduce living at different moments of production, reproduction and realisation of capitalist value. However this integration does not create these new value subjects as a singular and cohesive class of working women and men. Instead, it produces many segmented labouring classes whose livelihoods depend on insecure and oppressive wage employment or a wide range of survival activities for money income in the informal economy. The result is the paradox of East Asian development - the increase of the traditional working class has been marginal in the rise of East Asia as a workshop of the world. This again created a complex condition for social movements of labour. A close look at the current struggles of new value subjects in Thailand, Korea, Cambodia and China reveals that these new value subjects are capable of going beyond the boundaries set up by the previous struggles of organised labour. However, it also tell us that there is a serious disjuncture between the emerging social movements of labour and the existing trade union movement of the ‘industrial working class’ in East Asia. This challenge calls for a reconsideration of the theories and practices of the labour movement that presuppose a process of coherent working class formation.","bibo:AuthorList":["Chang, Dae-Oup"],"dc:date":"2012-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52365,"sim:weight":0.643914,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3886,"sim:weight":0.58786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77244,"sim:weight":0.578028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":114355,"sim:weight":0.570236,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109759,"sim:weight":0.54709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":337078,"sim:weight":0.533621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":177403,"sim:weight":0.52907,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5149,"sim:weight":0.520293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":401,"sim:weight":0.501882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109389,"sim:weight":0.491737,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9256546,"sim:weight":0.486324,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9543354,"sim:weight":0.486028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9552825,"sim:weight":0.481639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":447,"sim:weight":0.474615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":114000,"sim:weight":0.467277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":16902,"sim:weight":0.464763,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":75202,"sim:weight":0.46299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":940,"sim:weight":0.462293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2494,"sim:weight":0.461975,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3079,"sim:weight":0.460183,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, the late 2000s have seen a policy U-turn in the GCC’s attitude toward nuclear power, with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia now pursuing plans for their own nuclear reactors by the 2020s. The introduction of civilian nuclear programmes to the GCC is symptomatic of a more structural shift in the way the GCC and the wider Gulf produces and consumes energy. Rapidly rising levels of domestic energy consumption have already made the GCC a regional energy consumer rivalling the combined energy demand of Latin America. This renders alternative sources of energy, including nuclear power, an increasingly attractive long-term solution in view of the region’s otherwise rapidly rising drag on its own main export products – crude oil and natural gas. However, nuclear power raises a number of economic, political, and security question in the fragile Gulf region. This energy comment by Laura El-Katiri explores the reasons for the GCC’s pursuit of nuclear power, and questions the economic and political rationale behind the move.","bibo:AuthorList":["El-Katiri, Laura"],"dc:date":"2012-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":88448,"sim:weight":0.67166,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9427273,"sim:weight":0.58538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8763962,"sim:weight":0.504697,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109143,"sim:weight":0.400124,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710254,"sim:weight":0.391229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109140,"sim:weight":0.373685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108651,"sim:weight":0.371508,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108908,"sim:weight":0.367723,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108195,"sim:weight":0.361274,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108817,"sim:weight":0.3479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108636,"sim:weight":0.335277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734370,"sim:weight":0.327637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108883,"sim:weight":0.325007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090401,"sim:weight":0.30808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.29976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85356,"sim:weight":0.290917,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108965,"sim:weight":0.290491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154411,"sim:weight":0.289866,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2751284,"sim:weight":0.288756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5090434,"sim:weight":0.285461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A new breed of historians and sociologists has attempted to look at the ways in which Middle Eastern societies were reshaped by the war. This article seeks to demonstrate how specialized historical, cultural and social knowledge was put to use by the French intelligence in the Middle East, during the First World War. By looking at the case of Dominican Father Antonin Jaussen, this article will reveal the limits of the use of Oriental knowledge as a mechanism of modernity as well as its impact on this period on the history of the Middle East, suggesting that this method became a leading principle in the post-war era. The case of Father Jaussen suggests that Orientalist knowledge for calculating wartime exigencies set the stage for the use of these very methods in the post-war, state-building era. This essay is finally intended to serve as both an opening to further research on specific subjects such as Jaussen, and as a call to develop new historiographical tactics when dealing with issues that connect European and Middle Eastern actors and structures. Jaussen and many other European actors still to be examined in depth, also inadvertently implanted and encouraged the seeds of bureaucratic and intellectually hierarchical statecraft by the very methods they used.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mazza, Roberto","Ouhes, Idir"],"dc:date":"2012-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2793389,"sim:weight":0.31169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5225445,"sim:weight":0.295534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47545,"sim:weight":0.29354,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2784784,"sim:weight":0.286592,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2790077,"sim:weight":0.280399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382971,"sim:weight":0.279837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4880843,"sim:weight":0.273006,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109759,"sim:weight":0.272426,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.271389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383428,"sim:weight":0.268475,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108636,"sim:weight":0.267476,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187438,"sim:weight":0.255626,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":6197556,"sim:weight":0.254922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382973,"sim:weight":0.254026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.252331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710546,"sim:weight":0.250231,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383607,"sim:weight":0.250099,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709904,"sim:weight":0.246499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187672,"sim:weight":0.242319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101532,"sim:weight":0.241754,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
