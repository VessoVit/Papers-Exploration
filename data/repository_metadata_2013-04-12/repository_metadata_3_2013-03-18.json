The potential benefits to education, particularly for SEN, were also noted many years ago (Byrnes \u0026 Fox, 1998), viz that cognitive neuroscience might offer new data and a fresh perspective on some hitherto intractable educational problems, for example, why do some children not learn to read as easily as most; why doesn’t every child ‘get’ fractions (O’Boyle \u0026 Gill, 1998)? The responses of the education profession, especially in the UK, have been mixed. On the one hand, there are those ageing education academics who, after a lifetime of not understanding and disparaging all science, see no need to change their ways now. On the other hand, there are the ‘brain-based’ enthusiasts who hope that the current fads of left-right thinking, brain gym, etc., will address the complexities and daily challenges of the mixed-ability classroom (Goswami, 2004). A middle-way would seem to involve neuroscientific education for both groups so that education can shape a professionally informative educational neuroscience research agenda of the future. This paper discusses five arguments (Geake, 1998) in favour of the development of an educational neuroscience.","bibo:AuthorList":["Geake, J"],"dc:date":"2005-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":309339,"sim:weight":0.468715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.267044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108416,"sim:weight":0.250603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46829,"sim:weight":0.243653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76703,"sim:weight":0.241464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47157,"sim:weight":0.233977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.230947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.230813,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98688,"sim:weight":0.228687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.226002,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3222,"sim:weight":0.223823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.222595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.219733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631633,"sim:weight":0.213225,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2851,"sim:weight":0.206766,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387351,"sim:weight":0.204635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.204427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.204369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55808,"sim:weight":0.200079,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48298,"sim:weight":0.197744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

There is, however, room for\nimprovement in a number of important aspects of provision and practice in assessment which, if addressed, offer the prospect of significant improvement in the quality and appropriateness of teaching and learning and, ultimately, in higher achievement by the pupils.","bibo:AuthorList":["ETI"],"dc:date":"1998","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":60337,"sim:weight":0.577117,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309151,"sim:weight":0.573745,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.563877,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45828,"sim:weight":0.55559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.537629,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44980,"sim:weight":0.530948,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50117,"sim:weight":0.519846,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309052,"sim:weight":0.508328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383627,"sim:weight":0.501498,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46934,"sim:weight":0.498747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.492599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385543,"sim:weight":0.487478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710085,"sim:weight":0.484238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309419,"sim:weight":0.481555,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.477692,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108259,"sim:weight":0.464281,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.461762,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309086,"sim:weight":0.448043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309152,"sim:weight":0.438216,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387068,"sim:weight":0.427505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The number of nurseries and schools inspected as part of the survey of substitute teaching was 108, including 16 nurseries, seven special schools, 69 primary schools and 16 post-primary schools. Interviews were held with most of the substitute teachers whose work was inspected; these interviews centred on their experience of working as substitute teachers and issues arising. Furthermore, interviews were held with the principals of almost all of the nurseries and the schools to determine the nature and effectiveness of the schools’ management of substitute cover and issues arising.","bibo:AuthorList":["ETI"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":309216,"sim:weight":0.703672,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":363580,"sim:weight":0.640997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309419,"sim:weight":0.620562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761107,"sim:weight":0.484048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.467119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.466295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383627,"sim:weight":0.461596,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45828,"sim:weight":0.437636,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387068,"sim:weight":0.41407,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309086,"sim:weight":0.390328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.386219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385543,"sim:weight":0.377066,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.3676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1350000,"sim:weight":0.329374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108336,"sim:weight":0.318568,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309056,"sim:weight":0.309167,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383611,"sim:weight":0.294922,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67170,"sim:weight":0.291168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309443,"sim:weight":0.290569,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83520,"sim:weight":0.280512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The major objective\nof the project, in monitoring and identifying progression patterns, was to focus particularly on routes to vocational education or training over the three year period and to identify the characteristics, including additional studies, of Intermediate programmes which enabled students to achieve success in GNVQ Advanced and Jobskills mainstream\nprogrammes. The three-year period of monitoring enabled the project to examine\ndestinations beyond GNVQ Advanced and Jobskills including employment, higher\neducation and continuance in any form of education or training (lifelong learning) as\nmeasures of successful outcomes. The report provides a detailed account and analysis of\nthese patterns at each of the three survey stages in December 1997, 1998 and 1999\nincluding a total of 121 statistical tables.\nThe sample was calculated to be 25% of the overall population of the total 1,453 GNVQ\nIntermediate graduates in Northern Ireland as identified in 1997 by DENI statistics. It\nwas judged to be representative when characteristics were compared with both the\nNational GNVQ Survey (FEDA 1997) and profiles identified in reports from the DENI\nEducation and Training Inspectorate. In the second year of the survey 292 (80.2% of the\nsample) people responded while 286 (78.6% of the sample) did so in the third and final\nyear.","bibo:AuthorList":["DEL"],"dc:date":"2006-10-16T14:02:08Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":94656,"sim:weight":0.698477,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46621,"sim:weight":0.586325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4132,"sim:weight":0.569845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57352,"sim:weight":0.516057,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41233,"sim:weight":0.468379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1494613,"sim:weight":0.336221,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":740,"sim:weight":0.325856,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94459,"sim:weight":0.308368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101388,"sim:weight":0.297698,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109073,"sim:weight":0.294157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94136,"sim:weight":0.287398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82073,"sim:weight":0.284157,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779648,"sim:weight":0.284101,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.27687,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102606,"sim:weight":0.248671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58495,"sim:weight":0.246331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101495,"sim:weight":0.245663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91337,"sim:weight":0.236109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":103137,"sim:weight":0.235105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387381,"sim:weight":0.233195,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It suggests that sectarian violence is\nworse in some areas than others and that it is a serious problem in parts of Belfast and\nsome other urban locations.

This study set out to investigate the perceptions of those involved with children experiencing learning difficulties in connection with their spiritual development. Research focuses on Catholic children attending special schools in the controlled sector within the Belfast Education and Library Board, who are placed at Stage five of the Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of Special Educational Needs Northern Ireland (1998).\n\nA triangulation approach was employed incorporating the research instrument of (a) a questionnaire and (b) an evaluative interview. A qualitative research methodology to identify perceptions was used. The main aim of this approach was to identify different perspectives and contradictions to sacramental preparation, and the subsequent implications for the key educational partners namely, the home, school and parish. \n\nA number of important issues emerge from the analysis of data. \n\tHuman rights for all in education.\n\n\tThe development of structured sacramental programmes to address the needs of children experiencing learning difficulties, in particular children with SLD and MLD, is a basic requirement for teachers in special schools. \n\n\tSchools and parishes ought to channel their energies in working together to support each child and where possible, to re-educate parent(s) in their unique responsibility to the spiritual development of their child.\n\nThe partnership of the home, school and parish is a positive model for the religious education of children. Schools and parishes should give priority to this, working together to promote community.","bibo:AuthorList":["Treanor, Sharon"],"dc:date":"2002-10","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.556173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108621,"sim:weight":0.510382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102839,"sim:weight":0.504507,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.503819,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269878,"sim:weight":0.500197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.473579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102729,"sim:weight":0.472296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.449804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84859,"sim:weight":0.437133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382460,"sim:weight":0.435237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.432585,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.411076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108425,"sim:weight":0.38964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99226,"sim:weight":0.389119,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43580,"sim:weight":0.369933,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108530,"sim:weight":0.363625,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43888,"sim:weight":0.359365,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176831,"sim:weight":0.35814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108805,"sim:weight":0.35358,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309337,"sim:weight":0.352244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It also addressed the effectiveness of a range of approaches to the management of such children with ADHD in the classroom.  These approaches included medical intervention in the form of a prescribed drug and the use of a behaviour management strategy.   \n\nThe research focused on a sample of primary schools in the North Eastern Education and Library Board.  The opinions of teachers were sought through the completion of questionnaires, and the results enhanced with information collected through semi-structured interviews.  In this way a range of both qualitative and quantitative data was collected and collated in this small-scale research project.\n\nAnalysis of the information demonstrated that children with ADHD do impact upon the mainstream classroom and usually in a negative manner.  The study found that a variety of approaches could be effective in managing ADHD children.  In some cases the best solution was a combination of methods, generally involving the use of a prescribed medication alongside a behavioural management strategy.  Results showed that the most effective form of behavioural management was a positive behaviour strategy or ‘time out’.","bibo:AuthorList":["McClintock, Laura"],"dc:date":"2002-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":316186,"sim:weight":0.568175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77049,"sim:weight":0.505572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98868,"sim:weight":0.50332,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5067334,"sim:weight":0.495938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48326,"sim:weight":0.464456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76703,"sim:weight":0.450097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270152,"sim:weight":0.436269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381991,"sim:weight":0.43463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108621,"sim:weight":0.426534,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.417776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.409229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778976,"sim:weight":0.398424,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.397462,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.396715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631518,"sim:weight":0.393337,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47157,"sim:weight":0.389403,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101496,"sim:weight":0.387964,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":77943,"sim:weight":0.383252,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709915,"sim:weight":0.375336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.37315,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

From an historic perspective the theoretical foundations of the transfer procedure were rooted in a view of intelligence that saw hereditary factors as predominant. From a parental perspective there was a lot at stake - many parents perceived a grammar school education as more prestigious as it was the pathway to higher education and hopefully a better job. Their children would enjoy better life chances than they had done. From the child\u0027s perspective there were many hours of repetitive exercises whose purpose they only partially understood. While there may have been divergent views regarding the merits of the 11+, all concerned shared in one commonality - the whole exercise generated a great deal of fear, stress and anxiety.

The project provides an additional theoretical perspective in its exploration of pupil rights specifically in relation to assessment issues presently on the policy agenda in the Northern Ireland context. An emergent model of pupil rights is being conceptualised and tested heuristically through the three interrelated studies (the pupil voice in Pupil Profiles at KS2; engaging pupils in Assessment for Learning at KS3; and Teacher Perspectives) that make up the overall design of the CPAL project. The presentation will outline how various methods are being considered and developed to meet the goals of the studies and to ensure pupil consultation in their development.","bibo:AuthorList":["Leitch, Ruth","Lundy, Laura","Clough, Peter","Galanouli, Despina","Gardner, John"],"dc:date":"2005-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":50117,"sim:weight":0.628113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9624511,"sim:weight":0.531871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.498093,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109202,"sim:weight":0.450369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.44436,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.429062,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.404138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160558,"sim:weight":0.40105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5127,"sim:weight":0.391075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.389158,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43855,"sim:weight":0.389047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.386398,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154182,"sim:weight":0.38417,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.373478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.350646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2851,"sim:weight":0.343702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.342976,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48409,"sim:weight":0.328469,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47157,"sim:weight":0.326655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.323393,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Qualitative data drawn from one Grant-Maintained-Integrated and one Catholic primary school in Northern Ireland show how school ethos, defined as the observed practices of school members, often departs considerably from school ethos defined as those values and beliefs which the school officially supports. On the basis of the data it is argued that much of what we understand of school ethos is superficial and contradictory. With this in mind the paper concludes by presenting a new angle on ethos which, when taken in conjunction with the other perspectives, further enhances our understanding of how schools work.","bibo:AuthorList":["Donnelly, Caitlin"],"dc:date":"1999-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.62656,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269878,"sim:weight":0.572095,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382460,"sim:weight":0.546607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383349,"sim:weight":0.498212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.450325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.429814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46829,"sim:weight":0.427985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.411726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653898,"sim:weight":0.405463,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2850,"sim:weight":0.405162,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102839,"sim:weight":0.387319,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.375635,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99383,"sim:weight":0.374705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146054,"sim:weight":0.359705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.344661,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.33806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43799,"sim:weight":0.336504,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.33389,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108332,"sim:weight":0.332969,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.331836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

A report on educators’ views of teaching composing skills","bibo:abstract":"This paper explores secondary school music teachers’ views of creativity and some of their ideas about teaching composing skills. In order to do this, firstly an initial explanation of past and present controversies surrounding the meaning of the term creativity is given. The centralised production of music curricula during the 1990s has unified the knowledge pupils are expected to ‘attain’. However, issues concerning creativity, its meanings and their interpretation remain because they have not been resolved by centralised policy production. Secondly, different approaches taken by several studies on creativity are reviewed and a four-fold framework for researching music teachers’ views of creativity is suggested (i.e. Pupil - Environment - Process - Product).

This paper examines policy debates arising from these religious divisions between schools and, in particular, the role played by separate schools in an ethnically divided society. These debates have included discussions on the effect of separate schools on social divisions and communal violence; policy initiatives in education designed to promote tolerance and reconciliation; and debates over the extent to which equitable treatment should be provided in separate schools. The broader debate within which these issues exist lies in the merits or demerits of maintaining separate religious schools and, more particularly, in the dilemma between promoting social harmony or recognising minority rights.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gallagher, Tony"],"dc:date":"1998-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.65344,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.601707,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101496,"sim:weight":0.56192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48367,"sim:weight":0.512545,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61043,"sim:weight":0.505144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.479836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.449671,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76703,"sim:weight":0.447329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.445658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101576,"sim:weight":0.437465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43868,"sim:weight":0.367605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381996,"sim:weight":0.354561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.350012,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.348912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.348912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.348912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.348912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.348912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.348912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.348912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Interview responses demonstrated the strong impact of community influences on students’ ideas, but students also consciously and explicitly expected school history to provide a more balanced alternative to those influences.

The research investigated the responses of sixth-form students to a number of carefully chosen texts focused on “The Troubles”. In analysing the pupils’ responses, it was discovered that, although inherited sectarian tensions persist, it is possible in many cases to encourage pupils to critically examine their attitudes and even abandon some prejudices. The key elements are the choice of texts and the need to provide ample and skilfully directed opportunity for dialogue and reflection. These findings are particularly relevant in the current climate of curriculum change, with the new emphasis on “diversity” as well as “local and global citizenship”.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hanratty, Brian","Taggart, Dymphna"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1383665,"sim:weight":0.448439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.431372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76703,"sim:weight":0.419666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2778976,"sim:weight":0.417219,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.415085,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312612,"sim:weight":0.411329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.410603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381972,"sim:weight":0.406651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54709,"sim:weight":0.404467,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44647,"sim:weight":0.403036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":68254,"sim:weight":0.397565,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.390703,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.381615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709917,"sim:weight":0.367339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108257,"sim:weight":0.355749,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98742,"sim:weight":0.342786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45186,"sim:weight":0.34244,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382085,"sim:weight":0.331815,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43833,"sim:weight":0.328821,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734362,"sim:weight":0.326112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The paper draws on a doctoral study focussed on English music schoolteachers’ perceptions of creativity. Various research designs and results from previous studies were examined and the implications highlighted (Odena, 2001a). A qualitative research design was piloted with three teachers and subsequently refined (Odena, 2001b). It was then used to allow six final participants to reflect on their own ideas. Between three to five hours of music lessons on composition and improvisation were observed and videotaped for each teacher. Final interviews with participants were transcribed and the process of analysis was assisted by a software package for qualitative research (i.e. NVivo).

One of the main aims of YLT was to provide a\nmechanism to compare the views of adult respondents with those of all 12 to 17 year olds living in the same household. However, in 2001 a review of YLT was undertaken. A consultation with users of YLT found that although the interest in a young people’s survey was generally very high, directly comparing young people’s attitudes to those of the adult population was of relatively limited concern to those asked. The broad age-range of respondents resulted in problems of questionnaire design. For example, questions and topics appropriate for 17 year olds were not appropriate for 12 year olds.\nThere was also considerable unease about the methodological approach of the YLT survey in the then existing format. Interviewing young people in their\nhomes, often in the presence of their parents, raised questions about the\nreliability of the collected data and the ethical implications of this approach.\nAt the same time, interviewing young people in their schools in front of their peers seemed equally problematic.","bibo:AuthorList":["Schubotz, Dirk","Devine, Paula"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":363578,"sim:weight":0.416949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43868,"sim:weight":0.415653,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309124,"sim:weight":0.400533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101283,"sim:weight":0.355627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383571,"sim:weight":0.348641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57213,"sim:weight":0.343181,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.332084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381999,"sim:weight":0.324115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108332,"sim:weight":0.318705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44593,"sim:weight":0.313742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48401,"sim:weight":0.304115,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45277,"sim:weight":0.292328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.284494,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316083,"sim:weight":0.280359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98457,"sim:weight":0.279945,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309211,"sim:weight":0.278998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383641,"sim:weight":0.278229,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108621,"sim:weight":0.276864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383655,"sim:weight":0.275145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447707,"sim:weight":0.274787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The objectives of the evaluation were broadly to report how the initiative was working in terms of the processes involved and the outcomes achieved.  Qualitative methods of interview and observation complemented quantitative measures of reading ability throughout the evaluation period.\n\nThe study of the implementation process concentrated on the Reading Recovery teachers, principals and pupils in the 23 schools which joined the initiative at its outset in September 1994.  In the second year the evaluation extended to the newly involved schools (bringing the total to 51) and also took in the link teachers in the original schools.  Throughout both years opportunities were taken to collect the views of pupils’ class teachers and parents.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gardner, John","Sutherland, Anne","Meenan-Strain, Colette"],"dc:date":"1998","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":309211,"sim:weight":0.558874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309453,"sim:weight":0.490138,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":363580,"sim:weight":0.483765,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4153650,"sim:weight":0.47541,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309217,"sim:weight":0.466402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309424,"sim:weight":0.46549,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383627,"sim:weight":0.434289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309358,"sim:weight":0.430889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156595,"sim:weight":0.428538,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.427528,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.421368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309131,"sim:weight":0.419529,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.41491,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4187472,"sim:weight":0.414485,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43717,"sim:weight":0.411715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309216,"sim:weight":0.411052,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155556,"sim:weight":0.410084,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309361,"sim:weight":0.409729,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.405825,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.392151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Such research evidence also suggests that teachers have had little exposure to these issues in either their initial teacher training or their continuing professional development. This differential exposure to equality issues thus ensures an imbalance and, in most cases, a continued lack of understanding of the impact of equality issues on teachers’ own practice and professional development and thereby on the educational achievement of their pupils.\nThe present study attempts to investigate these themes further and to gauge the extent of awareness and prioritisation of equality issues in teacher education and training in\nNorthern Ireland. The research team was asked to establish the level of awareness of\nequality issues in relation to the content and delivery of teacher education and training\npolicy, beyond Northern Ireland. This includes and prioritises equality issues in teacher\neducation and training.

{"identifier":309219,"ep:Repository":3,"dc:type":["Thesis"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Are schools truly providing a fertile soil to develop the  ‘global child’ of the ‘Sonic Generation’? A Case Study of two Northern Ireland Schools in the SELB","bibo:abstract":"ICT usage is a way of life for the ‘Sonic Generation’ which enjoys great diversity of ICT tools such as the World Wide Web, mobile phones, ipods, palmtop computers, play stations, DVDs and cabled network TV – all or most of which are in every home.  Today’s child is a ‘global child’ whose perception of the world is increasingly shrinking as he keeps pace with fast-moving technology.\n\nThe impact of ICT and new media usage on life outside of school has led to a complete demassification of the media and has spawned a whole new kind of culture.  A culture that challenges schools in developing ICT skills in their pupils and one that requires teachers to expose children to open and distance learning systems. This case study of two Northern Ireland schools in the Southern Education and Library Board tests whether schools (primary and secondary) are truly providing fertile ICT soil for the ‘global child’ of the Sonic Generation’ and measures how far schools are in advancing towards virtual learning systems. \n\nThe study involved reviewing the history of ICT development in Northern Ireland from the early 1980’s to the present day’s ‘emPowering Schools in Northern Ireland Strategy’ published by The Educational Technology Strategy Management Group (ETSMG) in 2004.  Coutt’s (2001) Scottish-based study outlining a framework for reflection, planning and evaluation in school development in the use of ICT in learning and teaching provided the continuum against which the schools could be measured in terms of moving from a ‘traditional’ type school towards what he calls ‘Advanced Cyberschool’ status. Coutt’s framework also allowed teacher’s views on ICT to be placed into the category of ‘instrumental’, ‘tranformational’ or ‘revolutionary’.  Coutt’s study has implications for Northern Ireland schools in that it was influenced by a series of centrally-funded initiatives across the United Kingdom that included target setting, network access and training for teachers –some of which Northern Ireland schools were involved in.\n\nData was collected from quantitative surveys carried out amongst teachers and pupils and qualitative case study data and interviews conducted with ICT leaders in both schools. The study concluded that ICT is moving forward but at a slow pace. It further concluded that 40% of all pupils never receive or only ever receive ICT in all its forms once a month, therefore, in the main, schools are not truly providing a fertile soil for the ‘Sonic Generation’.  Pupils make greater use of ICT at home, which teachers do not exploit to the full by making home/school links. Both schools fall into Coutt’s ‘traditional’ model of teaching and learning in their use of ICT but in particular the secondary where 44% of teachers never or only ever deliver ICT once a month.

This paper examines empirical evidence of the relationship between a) initial schooling and b) adult participation in learning opportunities. The conventional hypothesis - widely reproduced in the adult education research literature - assumes that high levels of success in initial schooling will lead to high levels of participation in adult learning. Northern Ireland, however diverges from this pattern. While it displays high levels of attainment in schooling, further education and higher education when compared with the rest of the UK, it has a notably low level of participation in adult education and training. This paper will outline the empirical evidence of Northern Ireland\u0027s \u0027divergent\u0027 pattern, alongside a brief discussion of comparable trends in the Republic of Ireland, Britain and elsewhere. It will then outline a number of explanations of Northern Ireland\u0027s apparently distinctive pattern, and consider the implications for the conventional hypothesis.","bibo:AuthorList":["Field, John"],"dc:date":"1998-08","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.464019,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309221,"sim:weight":0.438402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101495,"sim:weight":0.423168,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309220,"sim:weight":0.394471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.386172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101388,"sim:weight":0.382651,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109073,"sim:weight":0.370068,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.360577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.359456,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":95974,"sim:weight":0.350134,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98457,"sim:weight":0.345096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383522,"sim:weight":0.336876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.332646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98688,"sim:weight":0.329804,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.326643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.326643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.326643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.326643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.326643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.326643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

However, most have concentrated on schooling, with little attention being given to vocational training or to learning in adult life. Drawing on data from a social attitudes survey in Northern Ireland, the paper presents evidence of a generally positive relationship between involvement in associational activities on the one hand and affirmative orientations towards lifelong learning. Thus, those who are engaged in a particular activity are considerably more likely to value lifelong learning than those who are not so engaged. Yet the survey also shows that those who were most clear about their own lack of involvement in a given activity were more positive towards lifelong learning than those who were indifferent towards the activity. The relationship between social capital and lifelong learning is therefore complex and multifaceted, rather than unilinear and simple.","bibo:AuthorList":["Field, John"],"dc:date":"2003-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":52031,"sim:weight":0.544188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.461486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.448882,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.43303,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.416572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.408641,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90426,"sim:weight":0.402338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":90465,"sim:weight":0.401223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.392619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.392047,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98457,"sim:weight":0.381377,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.380238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.380238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.380238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.380238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.380238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.380238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.380238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.380238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.380238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aims of the initiative were to provide additional support and resources to help 14 schools address significant disadvantage and under-achievement. Participating schools produced \"Action Plans\" to help focus their work around the key areas of: (A) the quality of management, teaching and learning within the school (B) improving the standards of literacy and numeracy (C) improving levels of qualifications (D) improving links with local industry (E) increasing parental involvement (F) dealing with problems of discipline, and (G) improving attendance and punctuality. The evaluation included the analysis of documents (eg school development plans, Action Plans, school policy documents), schools\u0027 statistics (pupil attainment. progress, attendance and behaviour), interviews and questionnaires. The paper will examine the extent to which participating schools were able to raise standards and the process of change in schools in relation to three key foci: management, teaching \u0026 learning and educational standards.

For this purpose, he has drawn on the conceptual framework of Jack Mezirow, paying particular attention to his work on \"perspective transformation\". The study has thrown into relief the contested terrain that permeates the educational policy area. In the context of the RoI, for example, there is evidence to suggest that Investment in Education, which was published in the 1960s, introduced an economic meaning perspective into Irish education, which eventually triggered a \"paradigm shift\" with respect to the development and implementation of educational policy there. The increasing recognition of the economic imperative in educational matters, both in the context of the RoI and in the wider OECD community, is causing concern for some educationalists, who contend that notwithstanding the importance that should be accorded to economic considerations, such should not detract from the personal and social objectives of the educational project as well.","bibo:AuthorList":["Murphy, Timothy"],"dc:date":"2005-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":55754,"sim:weight":0.543177,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108468,"sim:weight":0.538947,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.427271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154826,"sim:weight":0.423254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.423254,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46829,"sim:weight":0.41788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381996,"sim:weight":0.415961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.41302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.400505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85785,"sim:weight":0.400003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76300,"sim:weight":0.394433,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.390787,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.389021,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101576,"sim:weight":0.382941,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.38185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.370055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.361851,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47606,"sim:weight":0.36097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.359516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.356235,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The aim of the study was to document their attempts to ensure that their child received an appropriate education within an inclusive setting. The research was designed as a set of case studies conducted by means of semi-structured interviews. The dominant theme in parent reports was of an ongoing struggle to convince schools to accept their child and encourage positive expectations. Curricular access proved particularly problematic in post-primary education. It can be concluded that despite some positive experiences parents encountered a school system that was unprepared and often resistant to their child\u0027s inclusion. As a result, participation in school was based on a \"grace and favour\" approach.

{"identifier":309234,"ep:Repository":3,"dc:type":[],"bibo:shortTitle":"Learning together to live together: the role of multidenominational schools in a pluralist Ireland","bibo:abstract":"The Irish Primary school sector is predominantly denominational in character and 98% of schools are under the management of the Catholic Church. In 1978, against the backdrop of Ireland\u0027s membership of the EEC and the emergence of a growing, affluent, articulate and well educated middle class segment of society, the first multidenominational school opened in Dalkey, Co. Dublin. The underlying philosophy of the school was to provide child-centered, co-educational, democratically run schooling. The school was under the auspices of the Department of Education and followed the national curriculum. The main difference was the substitution of denominational religious education by the Ethical Core Curriculum. The aim of this curriculum was to educate children of all religions and none, together, and the emphasis was on giving children a basic sense of ethical, social and moral standards in the areas of honesty, respect, justice, integrity, trust and responsibility. The movement found much favour in some quarters, particularly in light of the sectarian troubles in Northern Ireland. However, there was much opposition from groups within the Catholic church and the government of the day which expressed a fear, \"not of multi-creed schooling but of non-creed schooling\". Despite this opposition the number of schools grew slowly and there are currently 22 such schools throughout Ireland. The research examines the role of these schools in an increasingly multicultural Ireland, the current, rapid growth in the sector and the role of the ethical core curriculum in informing both theory and practice in Irish education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Mulcahy, Carmel"],"dc:date":"2002-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Dagger.

These teachers\u0027 practices are analysed with reference to what and how they taught within structures provided by Bernstein (2000). At the time of the analysis, with no official syllabuses, these teachers had relative freedom to select what they taught. Since then the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has provided syllabuses for Junior Cycle, Senior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Physical Education (2000). The Junior Cycle Syllabus is currently (2005) being piloted in Irish post-primary schools. My original study examined the teaching of physical education in Ireland within a socio-cultural framework and acknowledged rapid changes in Irish society consistent with successfully embracing global capitalism. Concerns about the effects of globalisation, outlined by Maguire (2004), resonate within my analysis of the Irish education system. This current paper progresses my original concerns by looking at the roles of these teachers through a philosophical lens of care theory, described by Noddings (2002). Implications for the caring practices demonstrated by these three teachers are considered by analysing changes implied within the introduction of prescribed syllabuses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Moles, Joanne"],"dc:date":"2005-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"R Anderson.

The project has evolved over five phases. In phase one, science assessments used in a variety of educational systems in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US were located and catalogued. In phase two, approximately 170 performance tasks were selected and adapted by the project team to suit the requirements of the Irish primary science curriculum. In phase three, a purposive convenience sample of 183 teachers evaluated the extent to which the tasks (a subset of sixty-seven) were suitable for use at different grade levels. The teachers\u0027 feedback was used to amend tasks. In phase four, the researchers observed eleven different tasks being implemented in classrooms. The eleven teachers involved were interviewed about their experiences immediately afterwards. Again, based on the outcomes of this study, changes were made to the tasks. The fifth phase of the project, due to be completed in 2005, will involve dissemination of 124 of the tasks to teachers via the Web and book/CD-ROM. Planning with respect to other elements of the project such as professional development courses and exemplars of performance has yet to be finalised.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kilfeather, Paula","O\u0027Leary, Michael","Varley, Janet"],"dc:date":"2005-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.553981,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50117,"sim:weight":0.541562,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.533841,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108693,"sim:weight":0.506496,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.49951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.483465,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761107,"sim:weight":0.476873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631915,"sim:weight":0.429949,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57289,"sim:weight":0.424103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.420888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.416645,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.416197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.409302,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.407045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109102,"sim:weight":0.404839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.403701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.388339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.387419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.379543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.379543,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Although a number of variables may impact on pupils\u0027 perception of school, this paper focused on differences due to school type and gender.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gallagher, Tony","McKeown, Eamonn"],"dc:date":"2000-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19158,"sim:weight":0.497923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106147,"sim:weight":0.427055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60337,"sim:weight":0.413155,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316483,"sim:weight":0.395823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57289,"sim:weight":0.375604,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.371042,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23668,"sim:weight":0.364909,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.364522,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387418,"sim:weight":0.362736,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":102729,"sim:weight":0.35864,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83508,"sim:weight":0.357453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.35173,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43722,"sim:weight":0.348805,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2859,"sim:weight":0.347773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61043,"sim:weight":0.34644,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108693,"sim:weight":0.345577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309205,"sim:weight":0.342328,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82228,"sim:weight":0.336599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108239,"sim:weight":0.330238,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45666,"sim:weight":0.319621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It begins by considering some of the literature on performance assessment and concludes with a discussion on the potential of the tasks to support teaching and learning in science. The main body of the article is structured to reflect the five phases of the research project itself. In phase one, science assessments used in a variety of educational systems in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States were located and catalogued. In phase two, approximately 170 performance tasks were selected and adapted by the authors to suit the requirements of the Irish primary science curriculum. In phase three, a purposive convenience sample of teachers evaluated the extent to which the tasks (a subset of 67) were suitable for use at different grade levels. The teachers\u0027 feedback was used to amend tasks. In phase four, the researchers observed 11 different tasks being implemented in classrooms. The eleven teachers involved were interviewed about their experiences immediately afterwards. Again, based on the outcomes of this study, changes were made to the tasks. The fifth phase of the project, due to be completed in 2006, will involve the dissemination of 124 of the tasks to teachers via a booklet and a CD-ROM. Future prospects relating to other elements of the project such as Web-based resources, professional development courses and exemplars of performance are also discussed.","bibo:AuthorList":["Kilfeather, Paula"],"dc:date":"2006-03","doi":"10.1080/03323310600597501","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":50117,"sim:weight":0.54045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.540439,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.512579,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108693,"sim:weight":0.499979,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.474889,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2761107,"sim:weight":0.473556,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27452,"sim:weight":0.469497,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.462217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1631915,"sim:weight":0.422269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":57289,"sim:weight":0.409682,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154630,"sim:weight":0.402473,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.391076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.389999,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.388772,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.386131,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109102,"sim:weight":0.383547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.37659,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.3731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.368977,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.358045,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The ideas and understandings of 96 children and 168 student teachers were explored. Results showed that the student teachers and children had similar ideas about ‘flower’\nand ‘animal’, whereas they evidenced very different responses to ‘living’, ‘energy’ and ‘force’.

Over half the children defined geography as being about themes and places. A clear emphasis on the learning of place names and\nfact learning came through in definitions. There were limited references to learning key ideas or concepts. Skills, with the exception of \u0027maps\u0027 were mentioned by few children. No child mentioned fieldwork. The definitions written by the children tended to reflect geography topics they had\ncovered in school textbooks.

The study was based on the premise that teachers’ practices are guided in large measure by a ‘tacit knowledge’ of\neducation, formed in response to personal and contextual factors. It was held that sustained teacher and school development relate primarily to acquiring an awareness of and engaging in ongoing reflection on this implicit theory. Participants were facilitated in structuring such reflection through images*/as subjective knowledge structures which capture their latent understandings of teaching and learning processes. It was an enlightening and empowering experience for the teachers\ninvolved, who, as a consequence, could both envision and initiate necessary improvements in their educational practices.

Harnessing hitherto untapped archives, it shows how government was forced to bow to the divergent views and religious interests of Northern Ireland the society. This realpolitik was to produce a much less radical shake-up of ITE activity while leaving the Catholic sector essentially intact. The paper demonstrates the relevance of historical factors, the risks inherent in the failure to establish representative review bodies and the power and political adroitness of the Catholic Church at a critical juncture. The authors conclude that, in the political and social context of the 1980s, Chilver represented \u0027a bridge too far\u0027.","bibo:AuthorList":["McMinn, Richard","Phoenix, Éamon"],"dc:date":"2005-03","doi":"10.1080/03323310500184228","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":102729,"sim:weight":0.266196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383583,"sim:weight":0.260662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":58879,"sim:weight":0.242027,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108273,"sim:weight":0.241414,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1382082,"sim:weight":0.237268,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.234038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44140,"sim:weight":0.230427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43868,"sim:weight":0.228192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98909,"sim:weight":0.228097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145598,"sim:weight":0.221505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381996,"sim:weight":0.214118,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1929875,"sim:weight":0.213696,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1633037,"sim:weight":0.212652,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43523,"sim:weight":0.210694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.205639,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43684,"sim:weight":0.205499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108724,"sim:weight":0.199823,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84845,"sim:weight":0.19561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108972,"sim:weight":0.195599,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109083,"sim:weight":0.190338,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In this article we report on the generative potential of educational conversation, when it is structured around questions which allow teachers to reflect on their best teaching selves in past practice and to project those selves into future situations. We suggest that within the staff, the public relating of teaching narratives, and the reflective conversation to which they give rise, constitutes a public and collective form of enquiry into teaching and learning. We argue that reflective conversation is dependent upon critical listening, where the listener is open to what is being said, but is also prepared to ask questions that open up the topic of teaching and learning in ways that are revelatory for both speaker and listener.","bibo:AuthorList":["McDermott, Kevin","Richardson, Fiona"],"dc:date":"2005-03","doi":"10.1080/03323310500184418","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.639372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383671,"sim:weight":0.633808,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2850,"sim:weight":0.626153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710094,"sim:weight":0.61643,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387062,"sim:weight":0.601333,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1584852,"sim:weight":0.60053,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.594779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381991,"sim:weight":0.57421,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.552951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85729,"sim:weight":0.539836,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316127,"sim:weight":0.535839,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.516782,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.512329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76964,"sim:weight":0.505958,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.495182,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.491458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.471548,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108223,"sim:weight":0.469294,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46553,"sim:weight":0.466277,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":270152,"sim:weight":0.465359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This study was carried out over a period of seven years and has tracked young people from the age of 11 through to age 18. The study began in 1996 when 60 pupils from ten primary schools were interviewed and observed in Year 7. Following this, our 60 pupils were interviewed and 3,000 young people from 50 schools were surveyed for each of the five years of post-primary education. Each year, these young people gave their views and perspectives on their experiences of the school curriculum. At the end of Key Stage 2, and at Key Stages 3 and 4, the views of teachers and school senior managers were also garnered. \nthe results from the full seven years of the Cohort Study are drawn together in this report, which highlights implications for the new educational contexts that have emerged over recent years, including: the new proposals for the Key Stage 3 curriculum set out in Pathways (CCEA, 2003); changes to the transfer procedures from primary to post-primary school (as proposed by the Costello Report, 2004); and the wider debate surrounding the future of 14–19 education (such as the work of the DfES Working Group on 14–19 Reform, chaired by Mike Tomlinson, and England’s recent 14–19 Education and Skills White Paper (GB.

The report also contains comment on some key policy decisions and reports which have issued in the period June 2006-February 2007.\nA major concern emerging during the period 2004- 2006 relates to the need for more joined-up thinking and action on the part of all those with responsibilities for education, training, youth work, and key related services, including health and\nsocial services. In the current climate of rapid and sweeping change, co-ordinated policy, planning and delivery are vital.

The underlying issues also arise in different ways in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Policy in this area is diverging between the four home countries. \nThis Commentary on 14-19 Education draws on evidence from TLRP projects working in post-compulsory settings. However, issues from schools are also likely to apply as personalisation develops within 14-19 education and training. Both sectors would benefit from more conceptual clarity, and from more awareness of the interconnectedness of the issues involved. This is a necessary foundation for the development of coherent policy and practice.","bibo:AuthorList":["TLRP"],"dc:date":"2006-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.706228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.67381,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.643844,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101495,"sim:weight":0.635542,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101388,"sim:weight":0.631471,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.62373,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.605578,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51515,"sim:weight":0.58209,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.579058,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.578862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.572261,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46621,"sim:weight":0.569273,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.565293,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.535903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.531796,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309598,"sim:weight":0.52193,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383522,"sim:weight":0.517987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.512701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.512701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.512701,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Teaching is the main way of achieving this. Teaching and learning are what ultimately make a difference in the mind of the learner, and thus affect knowledge, skills, attitudes and the capacity of young people to contribute to contemporary societies.\nThis TLRP Commentary has two main purposes. It provides highlights to date from each project in the schools’ portfolio. In addition, it looks across all TLRP projects to present ten ‘Evidence-informed Principles of Teaching and Learning’.

In the case of the latter group the difference has been narrowing over time.\nInterestingly the Report shows that females fared better at Maths and Science than did boys, that the fall-off can be found between GCSE and ‘A’ level, and that fewer females achieving the necessary entry-level\nqualifications apply for IT and Electronic Degree courses.\nInterestingly the Report shows that females fared better at Maths and Science than did boys, that the fall-off can be found between GCSE and ‘A’ level, and that fewer females achieving the necessary entry-level qualifications apply for IT and Electronic Degree courses.","bibo:AuthorList":["Osborne, Bob","Shuttleworth, Ian"],"dc:date":"2003-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":19208,"sim:weight":0.289992,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23990,"sim:weight":0.261588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81626,"sim:weight":0.258139,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":89028,"sim:weight":0.255986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1445483,"sim:weight":0.255223,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":740,"sim:weight":0.252446,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93645,"sim:weight":0.250412,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82321,"sim:weight":0.244023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94459,"sim:weight":0.233369,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82790,"sim:weight":0.232708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":22708,"sim:weight":0.224843,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46856,"sim:weight":0.218453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779648,"sim:weight":0.211739,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60337,"sim:weight":0.210598,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":91337,"sim:weight":0.209217,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82722,"sim:weight":0.204865,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":519274,"sim:weight":0.201957,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":94647,"sim:weight":0.199944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309221,"sim:weight":0.19718,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93923,"sim:weight":0.195121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Using Literature To Develop The Global Dimension For Key Stage Four Pupils (And Above) In Northern Ireland:  An Investigation","bibo:abstract":"This paper investigates the possibilities in using carefully selected literature to develop various aspects of the global dimension in the school curriculum for Key Stage Four pupils (and above) in Northern Ireland – and, by implication, for pupils at a similar stage in schools in the Republic of Ireland and Britain.  The texts chosen for detailed scrutiny, and evaluation of their pedagogical potential, focus on three main themes – conflict resolution, postcolonialism and issues around diversity and interculturalism, and environmental issues; other relevant concerns, however, such as anti-racism, are also acknowledged.  Before identifying a range of relevant texts, and providing detailed critical evaluation of a representative selection, the paper offers a quick sketch of some government and curricular initiatives focused on the global dimension, and glances, briefly, at the sometimes contested role which schools themselves can play in the global context.  While acknowledging, also, the problematic relationship between cultural pursuits, including the study of literature, and ethical behaviour, emphasis is placed on the key significance of using a dialogical model of education when teaching literature. Although the main focus of the paper is an investigation of texts suitable for Key Stage Four pupils, it is argued, in the conclusion, that a range of appropriate literary texts can also be identified and utilised for younger pupils.  Reference is also made, in the concluding section, to complementary research by the present author which reported on the classroom field-testing of some ‘Troubles’ literature similar to that identified in the current paper; in the earlier research,  however, the target group was a representative selection of sixth-formers from across Belfast’s ghettoised communities, and the exclusive focus was conflict resolution.","bibo:AuthorList":["Hanratty, Brian"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46636,"sim:weight":0.538937,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446442,"sim:weight":0.535322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352239,"sim:weight":0.522761,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44084,"sim:weight":0.521285,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43882,"sim:weight":0.516646,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734362,"sim:weight":0.513453,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":312612,"sim:weight":0.511657,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4415,"sim:weight":0.506007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383319,"sim:weight":0.505402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99021,"sim:weight":0.502911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43495,"sim:weight":0.496276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44018,"sim:weight":0.494395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1446425,"sim:weight":0.488603,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1447753,"sim:weight":0.478845,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734350,"sim:weight":0.473067,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43801,"sim:weight":0.471628,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2779646,"sim:weight":0.469384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44647,"sim:weight":0.469208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":48252,"sim:weight":0.458987,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383590,"sim:weight":0.45526,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper discusses the background to Irish in Northern Ireland from the plantation of Ulster to the aftermath of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. The Linguistic Atlas of Ireland and census returns provide demographic data. The position of Irish in the education system must be evaluated in the context of languages provision in the curriculum in general, not only in Northern Ireland, but in the UK as a whole. The lower status that Irish had in the European Union until recently has relegated it to a disadvantaged curricular position, where schools can only offer the subject after provision is guaranteed for major mainland continental languages. Examination entries figures are analysed to trace trends in uptake. Curriculum reviews in Britain and Northern Ireland that make languages optional from age 14 in a more crowded curriculum are discussed. While Irish should remain a reasonably popular choice for pupils, the future of the language in English medium schools in Northern Ireland is not assured.","bibo:AuthorList":["McKendry, Eugene"],"dc:date":"2007","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":108250,"sim:weight":0.573601,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43868,"sim:weight":0.458464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43819,"sim:weight":0.426665,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.421097,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309211,"sim:weight":0.403627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101576,"sim:weight":0.398694,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1381996,"sim:weight":0.391082,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101439,"sim:weight":0.331616,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60337,"sim:weight":0.317764,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.305967,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.304747,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.300953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108972,"sim:weight":0.294478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76703,"sim:weight":0.268246,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.267228,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.267218,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.251898,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109039,"sim:weight":0.232503,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":67144,"sim:weight":0.231523,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.231091,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Consequently, the authors analysed a wider range of documentation, drawing out the key points of reference relevant to the aims and values at the primary stage.","bibo:AuthorList":["Shuayb, Maha","O\u0027Donnell, Sharon"],"dc:date":"January 2008","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.508926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154826,"sim:weight":0.508926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309485,"sim:weight":0.50255,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309239,"sim:weight":0.451587,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4160052,"sim:weight":0.448008,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9016333,"sim:weight":0.432326,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108416,"sim:weight":0.42756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47157,"sim:weight":0.422655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55754,"sim:weight":0.418144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9029027,"sim:weight":0.417985,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":9028941,"sim:weight":0.417884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.417676,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.416306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.415574,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4155856,"sim:weight":0.401715,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309083,"sim:weight":0.400024,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76945,"sim:weight":0.395296,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.390658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":113840,"sim:weight":0.385311,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76300,"sim:weight":0.382633,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The approach has been to review recent initiatives and developments in assessment that shared this purpose in all four countries of the UK: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (see Appendix 2 for a list of projects included).\nIt is not the intention of this summary pamphlet to review and report on each of the projects. Rather the intention is to present a synthesis of lessons learnt that has emerged from our studies of the projects, combined with the insights of key experts who took part in a series of project seminars and interviews throughout the UK. This synthesis unfolds along two main axes: an exploration of the key processes involved in moving from an innovative idea to its embedding and sustainable development in the classroom; and a framework of principles and standards for effective assessment practices, which are set out in Appendix 1.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gardner, John","Harlen, Wynne","Hayward, Louise","Stobart, Gordon"],"dc:date":"2008-05-01T22:32:44Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":82510,"sim:weight":0.415998,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309045,"sim:weight":0.395863,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":27452,"sim:weight":0.385951,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96368,"sim:weight":0.282986,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":15247,"sim:weight":0.272621,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8999217,"sim:weight":0.272524,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99204,"sim:weight":0.271405,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309354,"sim:weight":0.262961,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.261883,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106236,"sim:weight":0.259788,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.252972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44980,"sim:weight":0.247395,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108108,"sim:weight":0.246147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387062,"sim:weight":0.243876,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.243288,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.240888,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108075,"sim:weight":0.236427,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109214,"sim:weight":0.232519,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":736,"sim:weight":0.23251,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.231873,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It argues that differences between children are constructed rather than simply described, and that the constructs embodied in official statistics and policy texts tend to dominate discourse in primary education currently. These constructions favour simplistic and evaluative categorisations which conceal as much as they\nreveal about diversity. Using ‘bilingual learners’ as an example, the survey shows how other, more productive, constructions are possible, and that they can be found in the work of critical researchers and in the practice of some teachers and schools. The authors advocate a dialogue between national policy and practitioners in developing these constructions, and outline the policy directions that would be necessary to support such a dialogue.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ainscow, Mel","Conteh, Jean","Dyson, Alan","Gallanaugh, Frances"],"dc:date":"2007-12","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.692769,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309518,"sim:weight":0.664316,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106236,"sim:weight":0.645397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309514,"sim:weight":0.608077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309517,"sim:weight":0.60259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.599547,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309515,"sim:weight":0.595997,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.592938,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.577912,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.540113,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.539849,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98868,"sim:weight":0.516399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.514871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309516,"sim:weight":0.502685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.49974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.478237,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.476926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.474752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.474752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.474752,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The project involved secondary schools in England. The results of the project are set out in four publications, under the ‘Inspiring Schools’ banner: Impact and Outcomes, A Literature Review, Case Studies for Change and Resources for Action.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, Lynn","Williams, Christopher","Yamashita, Hiromi","Man-hing, Ko"],"dc:date":"2006-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":9624511,"sim:weight":0.660826,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43909,"sim:weight":0.621359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49910,"sim:weight":0.617972,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.587284,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.568112,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5127,"sim:weight":0.557806,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.556837,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383349,"sim:weight":0.536185,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.531213,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.528828,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76703,"sim:weight":0.496207,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.495862,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.495667,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":93303,"sim:weight":0.485271,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.483376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99088,"sim:weight":0.480527,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85834,"sim:weight":0.456611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":85785,"sim:weight":0.446902,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.445241,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":60666,"sim:weight":0.441299,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The\noverall aim of the report is to summarise and assess the findings and explore their\nimplications for the future of primary education in the United Kingdom (UK). The report\nconcentrates on findings from some key UK based studies, as well as findings from a range\nof other UK based studies which have focused on eliciting pupils’ own perspectives of their\nexperiences at primary school. Findings from studies from outside the UK are not, therefore,\nincluded in this report, nor are findings which report teachers’, as opposed to pupils’,\nperceptions of pupil experiences.\nIn particular, the report focuses on pupils’ perceptions of the purposes of their primary\nschools, and their perceptions of learning, teaching, the curriculum and assessment, as well\nas pupils’ views on transfer from primary to secondary school. There is little evidence from\nformer pupils, and data relating to pupils’ perspectives on the culture and organisation of\nthe school, and to their aspirations and preferences in respect of their own futures, are also\nvery limited due to the lack of literature focusing on these areas. The literature also provided very little evidence to allow comparisons to be made in pupils’ perspectives across different social and culture groups.","bibo:AuthorList":["Robinson, Carol","Fielding, Michael"],"dc:date":"2007-11","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"P Alderson and V Morrow.

{"identifier":309511,"ep:Repository":3,"dc:type":["Working Paper"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Parenting, Caring and Educating","bibo:abstract":"In this survey of published research we review changing patterns in the structure of the families and identify trends in parenting and caring for today’s generation of primary school children. We reveal how the reduction in the number of children born, the increase in the proportion of lone parents and the increasing age at which women have their first child have resulted in greater diversity of family forms, and parenting and caring practices. The impact of these changes on primary education is discussed through a review of the impact of government policy in relation to the role of parents and the home-school relationship. We conclude that the diversity in family structures brings with it complex administrative demands for home–school communication and a complex array of family relationships for teachers to understand and engage with. The school remains a primary source of community-based support for working parents and carers, although the impact of complex employment arrangements adds to the demands for child care support beyond the school day.\nThe most challenging home circumstance, which cannot be viewed optimistically, is the increasing number of children living in relative poverty. Poverty remains a significant factor in the lives of many children with the inevitable impact in terms of health and wellbeing and a child’s capacity to engage fully in school activities, both financially and emotionally.\nFurther research is needed into the lives of children and how their complex family relations, and the caring roles which many children undertake, impact on their education. In reality home-school relationships are between individual parents and individual teachers who both have the interests of the child at heart. Parents are not a homogeneous group but neither are teachers, and attempts to improve the relationship between both groups need to acknowledge the strengths and expertise of both. Teachers need to establish more fruitful links between home and school which build on the support for children’s learning that already exists in the home and community. Further research as to how this can happen would be helpful.","bibo:AuthorList":["Muschamp, Yolande","Wikeley, Felicity","Ridge, Tess","Balarin, Maria"],"dc:date":"2007-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":1348456,"sim:weight":0.569685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.501553,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.48327,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82850,"sim:weight":0.475123,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309516,"sim:weight":0.468341,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145972,"sim:weight":0.460816,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383611,"sim:weight":0.46048,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76703,"sim:weight":0.45605,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.45386,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.438923,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":17849,"sim:weight":0.43144,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106236,"sim:weight":0.420726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1350000,"sim:weight":0.418367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43306,"sim:weight":0.417546,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2851,"sim:weight":0.414614,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.410169,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.398719,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99496,"sim:weight":0.396448,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98688,"sim:weight":0.396334,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.379331,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":309513,"ep:Repository":3,"dc:type":["Working Paper"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Primary Schools and Other Agencies","bibo:abstract":"This report examines the shifting relationships that have obtained over the past four decades between education and the various agencies with which primary school children in the UK may come into contact. The report deals primarily with agencies concerned with health, social care and the law. Based on an analysis of key policy texts, legislation and primary research studies, the report describes the changing configurations of provision for children deemed to be in need of support or intervention from agencies beyond the school. It identifies major shifts of policy and practice, culminating in the wide-reaching reforms of the post-1997 Labour governments. However the report also notes that two key assumptions have persisted across the decades. Firstly, the role of external agencies has consistently been construed as one of compensating for the deficits of the ‘insufficient child’ or family, although definitions of such deficits have varied over time. Children and families who have recourse to agencies continue to be tacitly defined as deficient with respect to an idealised, if invisible, ‘normal’ child or family who does not need additional support. Secondly, the desire for improved co-ordination amongst schools and other service providers has been a goal of policy from the 1960s onwards. Yet, while the ‘joined-up’ architecture of the most recent reforms represents a major move towards ‘extended’ provision and fuller collaboration, its effectiveness in serving the interests of children remains to be established. Early research suggests that barriers to communication and collaboration across professions are deep-seated and resistant to change.\n1.","bibo:AuthorList":["Barron, Ian","Holmes, Rachel","MacLure, Maggie","Runswick-Cole, Katherine"],"dc:date":"2008-05-26T12:31:18Z","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.506208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.485655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309516,"sim:weight":0.460738,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.412773,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53161,"sim:weight":0.404399,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":86140,"sim:weight":0.404013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108807,"sim:weight":0.401212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.401038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.395003,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2851,"sim:weight":0.389153,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.384044,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84845,"sim:weight":0.377269,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.376258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.376258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.376258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664212,"sim:weight":0.376258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.376258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.376258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.376258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667614,"sim:weight":0.376258,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

We decided to overview the salient issues, and then to identify a number of central\nthemes whose understanding seemed to us to be of central importance. It was clear also that\nsustained empirical research of life inside primary schools, or indeed any schools, of the kind\npublished in the 1980s heyday of ethnographical sociology is now limited. We found that\nwhat empirical studies did exist had also become more theoretically impoverished over the years. Atheoretical and simplistically evaluational approaches tend to dominate\ncontemporary academic published writing. This is not to deny that there is significant and\ncritical work being done by the likes of Pollard and Alexander (see, for example, Pollard \u0026\nTriggs 2001 and, in the international comparative field, Alexander 2001). Nevertheless, there seem to be large enclaves of sponsored research that did not seem able or willing to critically contest the realities of contemporary schooling.","bibo:AuthorList":["Jones, Liz","Pickard, Andy","Stronach, Ian"],"dc:date":"2008-02","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":309515,"sim:weight":0.737776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309516,"sim:weight":0.68196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":106236,"sim:weight":0.681588,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18102,"sim:weight":0.658499,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383619,"sim:weight":0.65423,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309505,"sim:weight":0.608077,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55754,"sim:weight":0.605742,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.586879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4154182,"sim:weight":0.569329,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309504,"sim:weight":0.56192,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309518,"sim:weight":0.54595,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.543559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46829,"sim:weight":0.53554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309517,"sim:weight":0.513756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.506125,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76584,"sim:weight":0.499145,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4156007,"sim:weight":0.497343,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.489411,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.4814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146054,"sim:weight":0.473691,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":309602,"ep:Repository":3,"dc:type":["Other"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Multi-dimensional structure of a (use of) mathematics self efficacy instrument","bibo:abstract":"This paper forms part of a larger study aiming to understand how cultures of learning and teaching can support learners in ways that help widen and extend participation in mathematically demanding courses in Further and Higher Education; this involves contrasting a traditional ‘mathematics’ programme with a new ‘use of mathematics’ programme in the U.K.. The particular interest in this paper is self-efficacy, given that social science literature on widening participation suggests that a positive disposition towards a subject is crucial to continuing to study a subject (Bandura and Cervone, 1983; Bandura and Locke, 2003). This paper is reporting on the development of an instrument to measure mathematical self-efficacy of college students studying ‘traditional mathematics’ and ‘use of mathematics’ programs. We will focus on the measurement issues emerging during the validation process with regard to the dimensionality of the construct. An instrument was built to measure self-efficacy (s.e.) of 16-17 year old students in relation to their use of mathematics, a ‘soft’ learning outcome measure that is expected to provide important information when contrasting subgroups following a ‘mathematics’ and a ‘use of mathematics’ programme. Analysis revealed significant DIF between the two subgroups. Further, multi-dimensional analysis suggests that ‘pure (P)’ and ‘applied (A)’ scores might better be reported separately (in addition to the overall ‘maths (M)’ s.e. score). Furthermore the subgroup score means P and A are significantly different in the expected direction (i.e. the use of maths group is significantly more confident on the Applied dimension and vice versa), while the relation of M (A, P) is nearly invariant across subgroups.","bibo:AuthorList":["Pampaka, M","Black, L","Hernandez-Martinez, P","Davis, P","Hutcheson, G","Nicholson, S","Williams, J","Wake, G"],"dc:date":"2007-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":671624,"sim:weight":0.329422,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.291532,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":176799,"sim:weight":0.267458,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.262731,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5465,"sim:weight":0.26105,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309343,"sim:weight":0.258655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.252133,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.250899,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18001,"sim:weight":0.245013,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.240179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1448002,"sim:weight":0.237733,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.233953,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.231973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.231709,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":104691,"sim:weight":0.22779,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101431,"sim:weight":0.223419,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.219109,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84837,"sim:weight":0.214502,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.213031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":41233,"sim:weight":0.205367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

It focuses on the ways in which mathematics teachers can use digital tools for enhancing the learning of functions and graphs within a classroom setting. It includes a comparison of two teachers working with information and communications technology within their own particular contexts and circumstances, and by comparing and contrasting the two situations gives an indication of the complexity of their learning environments. It emphasises the role of the teacher in bringing together the potential disparate possibilities of exploration that ICT might allow for students and concludes that thinking about the effective use of ICT for learning requires an holistic understanding of how ICT is integrated within the classroom milieu as determined by the teacher, environment, software, individual students and collective activity.","bibo:AuthorList":["Godwin, S","Sutherland, R"],"dc:date":"2004","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M COLE, M ENGESTRO¨ and Y.

These were conducted as part of a larger ESRC Teaching and Learning Research Programme (TLRP) project which aimed to evaluate the impact of policy on teaching, learning and assessment in the Learning and Skills sector. Documentary analysis related to Skills for Life (SfL) policy and data from interviews with 10 basic skills practitioners and managers are drawn upon. These were carried out from November 2004-May 2005. In addition, two ‘user affirmation’ seminars in May and July 2005 were used to trace how the SfL educational policy initiative implemented by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) through their local offices across the UK is impacting upon the teaching, learning and assessment of adult literacy and numeracy. In order to make sense of the large and complex data set emerging from the TLRP project we have taken a multiple perspectives approach to the analysis of educational policy and its impact upon practice. We then apply multiple conceptual frameworks to a single policy case (SfL). The aim of the paper is to show how a unitary perspective has tended to dominate applied policy research and to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of this perspective in the context of SfL practice. We analyse the same case from an alternative perspective to draw attention to the potential of multi-lens approaches to the analysis and evaluation of the impact of policy upon practice. Finally we discuss the implications of our analysis of SfL policy for pedagogy.","bibo:AuthorList":["Gregson, M","Nixon, L","Coffield, F","Edward, S"],"dc:date":"2005-09","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"B Bernstein.

In particular, they combine rigorous social and educational science with high awareness of the significance of the issues being researched. With reports from several studies showing the benefits of teaching young children about morphemes, this authors of this book have two aims: First, to persuade the readers that morphemes are extremely important for children learning to read and write; and second, to describe a set of studies that they carried out on teaching children about morphemes and their relation to written words. Challenging the idea that treating or teaching written English as a system of rules about letter–sound relationships with a few exceptions, they point out to children’s learning gains when working with morphemes. In this way, by breaking words down into chunks of meaning that can be analyzed as complete units rather than as strings of individual letters, children are better able to make sense of the often contradictory spelling and reading rules of English. As a result, their enjoyment of learning about words increases, and their literacy skills improve.

A critique of multi agency working in Northern Ireland to meet the needs of young people at risk of exclusion from mainstream schooling","bibo:abstract":"Social exclusion usually happens when people or areas suffer from a linked combination of factors that all have effects on one another. These situations normally require different agencies to work together, since they have expertise in dealing with different problems. However, the history of this type of ‘joined up’ practice is not good with experience, suggesting that this is rarely done as effectively as possible. This paper is based on an examination of the extent to which joined up practice operates in meeting the needs of young people at risk of dropping out of school in Northern Ireland. Professionals, who were both strategically and operationally involved in meeting the needs of those young people, were interviewed in relation to the role of their organisation and the nature of their engagement with other organisations. This may be due to top-down and bottom-up factors. Organisational structures traditionally encourage specialisation and ‘silo-thinking’, so effective joined-up practice may require specific policy pressure. On the other hand, joined-up practice may require more than people simply meeting together, but involve a requirement to learn new ways of working. The analysis of the interview data suggested that while most respondents agreed that inter-agency working was a good idea, most also agreed currently that it was limited. Evidence from a connected project in England, where the Every Child Matters policy is in place, suggests that there is a greater policy imperative encouraging multi-agency working.","bibo:AuthorList":["Carlisle, K","Gallagher, T","Kilpatrick, R","Daniels, H"],"dc:date":"2006-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.578931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":23275,"sim:weight":0.507222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108621,"sim:weight":0.49096,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.477087,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316478,"sim:weight":0.476295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1914779,"sim:weight":0.469926,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46563,"sim:weight":0.464279,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.459871,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":49918,"sim:weight":0.449306,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.446637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.444685,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.41478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.41478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.41478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.41478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.41478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.41478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.41478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661724,"sim:weight":0.41478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.41478,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The first is “Developmental Disorders”, where neuroscience has made the most significant impact to date, chiefly supported by the interests and motivations of educational psychologists. The second is “Teaching and Learning”, which includes issues of broad interest to those involved with the daily practice of teaching and learning. The third is “Curriculum”, where policy makers and educators have traditionally drawn upon a wide spectrum of factors when determining what should be learnt and when, including those derived from our knowledge of human development. It also contains a brief and speculative appraisal of recent developments that may significant for education in the future. In addition, Section 4 discusses issues with potential theoretical interrelationships between neuroscience and education, which is of undoubted importance to issues of perception discussed in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 touches upon research agendas and the general types of projects that might pursue them.","bibo:AuthorList":["Howard-Jones, P","Pickering, S"],"dc:date":"2005-04","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":309339,"sim:weight":0.442712,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1286,"sim:weight":0.351368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309343,"sim:weight":0.322325,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81717,"sim:weight":0.286036,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.280078,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.273867,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":18068,"sim:weight":0.269572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.268367,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.267374,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.266666,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.265322,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":741,"sim:weight":0.257959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55754,"sim:weight":0.254612,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.253679,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1573491,"sim:weight":0.253662,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154677,"sim:weight":0.252533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710651,"sim:weight":0.246276,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.241708,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.241607,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43077,"sim:weight":0.239705,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

In particular, they combine rigorous social and educational science with high awareness of the significance of the issues being researched. Despite the efforts that have been made to bring about improvements in the schools, some children and young people remain marginalised by current arrangements. The development of more inclusive schools remains one of the biggest challenges facing educational systems throughout the world. However, inclusion remains a complex and controversial issue, and the development of inclusive practices in schools is not well understood. In Improving Schools, Developing Inclusion the authors challenge many existing assumptions about school improvement and educational reform, and propose that the development of inclusive practice will only be achieved by engaging in dialogue about the deeply held beliefs of teachers and policy-makers. In doing so, they provide a new way of thinking about how schools can be made more inclusive. The authors consider (1) implications for the work of school leaders; (2) How staff teams can work together in order to address barriers to participation and learning (3) How schools can collect and use evidence in order to strengthen their practices (4) The critical and alternative perspectives to which schools need access and (5) The implications for relationships between schools, local authorities and researchers. At a time when policy-makers and practitioners are searching for more effective ways of responding to student diversity, this challenging book offers powerful messages as to what needs to be done to move schools in a more inclusive direction.","bibo:AuthorList":["Ainscow, M","Booth, T","Dyson, A","Farrell, P","Frankham, J","Gallannaugh, F","Howes, A","Smith, R"],"dc:date":"2006","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2851,"sim:weight":0.700702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1654510,"sim:weight":0.54103,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.532627,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309630,"sim:weight":0.532517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101496,"sim:weight":0.525392,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":76703,"sim:weight":0.513589,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.490561,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.490359,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":4162160,"sim:weight":0.487931,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101576,"sim:weight":0.474482,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.461038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.454376,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.451925,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8018,"sim:weight":0.448151,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.444055,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84845,"sim:weight":0.443516,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55808,"sim:weight":0.438886,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661725,"sim:weight":0.433879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661729,"sim:weight":0.433879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664210,"sim:weight":0.433879,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Data from this four-year longitudinal ESCR/TLRP study explored how these students made the initial transition into university and their progress towards the end point of their university career. These two biographies were selected from groups of 10 to 14 students from four institutions who had been followed for nearly three years with semi-structured interviews augmented with key informant interviews, observations in learning contexts and interviews with academic staff. In turn, these had been selected from an initial sample of 1000 disabled students from the four institutions who were surveyed over a four-year period. There was considerable variety in the type of disability reported. Although these students share the label ‘disabled\u0027 they also hold another perspective that they are not disabled. These two students are typical of the sample in that they emphasise the ‘atypicality’ of the average disabled student. The way that these students experienced and managed the transitions both into and out of the institution differs. These differences cannot be accounted for solely by reference to their impairment. Within-institutional differences such as the practices of different departments, attitudes among staff at all levels towards disability and, possibly more importantly, the social and cultural backgrounds of the students also played a role. In examining the differences between the students the paper also considers how transitions in and out of education are becoming increasingly a part of the lifelong learning agenda of policy makers. Higher education in the UK has undergone considerable change in the past two decades (see e.g. Riddell, et al, 2006) with a decrease in resources and an increase in the management of higher education which includes performance targets for specific groups such as disabled students. Institutional transitions from school to university or college to university are thus part of our social system and cannot be seen from a purely individual perspective (Ecclestone, et al, 2006). While transitions in and out of institutions and possibly within them, e.g. progression from the first two years of a university course into the honours part of a degree can be identified, these transitions have to be seen in the perspective of an individual’s overall learning career. Bloomer, (2001) notes that in order to understand the choices a student makes in order to become and continue as a student it is essential to take into account gender differences, family background, prior educational experiences and attainments and institutional cultures. The experiences of these students add to earlier studies (Riddell, et al 2005) and provide institutions and policy-makers with evidence that can be used to enhance the experiences of disabled students in higher education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Weedon, E","Riddell, S"],"dc:date":"2007-06","bibo:cites":[{"rawReferenceText":"M Bloomer and P Hodkinson.

Disability identity in Higher Education","bibo:abstract":"The concept of student success in this paper focuses on access issues for disabled students with hidden impairments. The necessity for these students to adopt a disability identity in order to access teaching and learning support in higher education will be critically theorised with supporting empirical data. This paper discusses students’ concept of a disability identity, with reference to their hidden impairments. Although students who volunteered for this study described themselves as disabled students, their relationship to disability is not so straightforward. Early analysis of interview data from students with hidden impairments show that they tend to conceptualise disability as being physical, supporting Deal’s (2003) theory of hierarchies of impairment. When talking about their own impairments, description focuses on particular support needs or specific issues. This seems to challenge the social model of disability being an holistic identity. These findings support Olney and Brockelman (2003) who argue that disability identity is transient; one is disabled according to the situation, not as a constant state of being. Many of the students only describe themselves as disabled in relation to their teaching and learning support needs. When no support is needed, there is no need for a disability identity. Interestingly, students do not view the label of disability negatively. Though none would chose to describe themselves as disabled, they believe the identity is useful in accessing support and explaining support to their peers. Concluding discussion centres on the possible implications these findings may have on students’ help-seeking behaviour. This support may contribute to higher retention rates of disabled students in higher education.","bibo:AuthorList":["Panting, C","Kelly, K"],"dc:date":"2006-05","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":43635,"sim:weight":0.686372,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108109,"sim:weight":0.648959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2734403,"sim:weight":0.596756,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45211,"sim:weight":0.589875,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43763,"sim:weight":0.572416,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1145895,"sim:weight":0.5597,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99461,"sim:weight":0.533648,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309640,"sim:weight":0.52179,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":61005,"sim:weight":0.507461,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383650,"sim:weight":0.494944,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108976,"sim:weight":0.486716,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2845,"sim:weight":0.485791,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43400,"sim:weight":0.48196,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":43727,"sim:weight":0.479165,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316190,"sim:weight":0.452063,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383658,"sim:weight":0.429959,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2709915,"sim:weight":0.420767,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":269897,"sim:weight":0.415942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.394043,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2729966,"sim:weight":0.393413,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

Interpreting the challenge of inclusion in secondary schools in England and Wales through participants’ theories of change","bibo:abstract":"If schools are to become more inclusive, practitioners need to engage with the assumptions that\nunderpin their practice, and often the school culture as a whole. This is particularly challenging in the\nlarge and complex organisation of a secondary school. An examination of the literature finds that there\nare many reasons why teachers engage with, or resist, educational change in general and the\ndevelopment of inclusive practice in particular. Whether at the level of the individual teacher, or the\ndepartmental or pastoral group, becoming more inclusive requires a critical perspective on current\npractice and can sometimes appear threatening or irrelevant in the light of other priorities.\nThe ESRC TLRP Project ‘Prosiect Dysgu Cydradd’ is co-funded by ESRC and the Welsh Assembly\nGovernment, and provides an opportunity to learn more about these issues in the comparative\ncontexts of Wales and England. The project will explore the factors that influence teacher engagement\nin structured reflective practice towards more inclusive learning for students. Existing groups of\nsecondary school teachers (in departments, for example, or pastoral groups) in schools in Wales and\nEngland will engage in a collaborative action research project in the area of pupil attitude, behaviour\nand learning. Further developing a systemic rather than individual pupil-focused role in schools,\neducational psychologists will play a key role in facilitating this process. The affordances and\nhindrances to teacher engagement will be monitored and an evaluation will be made of the effect of\nteacher engagement on student learning.\nThis paper discusses theory of change methodology, and how the project will be using this to enhance\nit’s exploration of factors that influence how teachers’ change and develop their inclusive practice. It\nwill present, using this framework, some of the early analysis of data gathered from teacher\nquestionnaires and interviews with key stakeholders. This begins the process of trying to understand\nthe factors that influence teacher engagement in making changes in their practice to develop inclusion.","bibo:AuthorList":["Davies, S.M.B","Howes, A"],"dc:date":"2005-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":8999217,"sim:weight":0.417309,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44980,"sim:weight":0.392854,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.392505,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":29770,"sim:weight":0.386454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710085,"sim:weight":0.37559,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.374379,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387062,"sim:weight":0.37259,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98717,"sim:weight":0.370874,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383671,"sim:weight":0.358197,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55808,"sim:weight":0.357904,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387068,"sim:weight":0.357637,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108663,"sim:weight":0.355936,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":316190,"sim:weight":0.351464,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2851,"sim:weight":0.350903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1146144,"sim:weight":0.350903,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5025,"sim:weight":0.345402,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2710094,"sim:weight":0.343007,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.342444,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":96368,"sim:weight":0.342295,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81717,"sim:weight":0.340726,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":309643,"ep:Repository":3,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Education and neuroscience: evidence, theory and practical application","bibo:abstract":"Between 2005 and 2006, the ESRC-TLRP seminar series ‘Collaborative Frameworks in Neuroscience and Education’ brought together over 400 teachers, neuroscientists, psychologists and policy-makers to discuss the potential for collaborative work that might lead to improved educational and neuroscientific understanding. This Special Issue of Educational Research brings together and examines many of the issues and opportunities highlighted by the seminar series. The Special Issue begin with a provocative article by John Geake scrutinising some of the most popular ideas about the brain to be found in today’s classroom. While they have usually been inspired by something related to neuroscience, any scientific basis has been so seriously misinterpreted, over-interpreted and/or misapplied that they are classified here as ‘neuromyths’. Usha Goswami reviews what we know about the core neural systems involved with learning to read and the biological basis of developmental dyslexia. Goswami demonstrates convincingly that existing studies suggest dyslexia is associated with an under-activation of key networks involved with reading, but also notes the shift during normal development of the brain areas involved with language as they become increasingly left-lateralised in most readers. The third paper by Sashank Varma and Daniel Schwartz ask how should educational neuroscience conceptualise the relation between cognition and brain function in mathematical reasoning. Liane Kaufmann, in her paper, draws attention to developmental differences in the neural mechanisms linking numerical processing and the use of fingers. The contribution by Lauren Stewart and Aaron Williamon provides a pioneering review of literature considering the neural basis of music and issues of cultural context and individual differences. In the final contribution, Howard-Jones, Winfield and Crimmins explore reports on an interdisciplinary attempt to co-construct pedagogical ideas spanning neuroscience and education. The context was drama education, but the findings echo some of the general issues highlighted by other authors in this issue.

The effects of policy on teaching, learning and assessment in the learning and skills system in England\u0027","bibo:abstract":"Several administrations have attempted to limit the populations of animals considered to be pests by offering a bounty for members of the public who kill such pests and hand in a part of the animal’s body as proof of their actions. For example in 1817 the American state of Iowa introduced a bounty for the pelts of wolves, several states offered bounties for rattlesnake tails (the bounty in Wisconsin for the tails of timber rattlesnakes was only withdrawn in 1975 when the snakes faced extinction), In almost all of these examples, accusations have been made that entrepreneurially minded individuals have taken advantage of legislation by breeding the offending animals in order to reap the bounties. This example illustrates how the best intentions of legislators can result in adverse, unintended outcomes as citizens apply legislation to their best advantage. In this paper we are using the metaphor of rattlesnake farming to apply to the adverse unintended consequences of vocational education and training policies in England. In recent times, with our awareness of the impact of human activities on animal populations, policies have been put in place to protect species in danger of severe decline or even extinction, for example, the designation of some beaches in Florida as protected areas for nesting turtles. This permits the turtles to lay their eggs, and have the young turtles grow in a sustaining environment before taking their chances in the world. These policies have been successful in stemming the decline in the population of turtles. In our paper turtle farming is the metaphor used to describe the kinds of activities that provide sustaining environments in which learning can take place. Our study of the impact of policy on teaching, learning and assessment indicates that policies can have unintended, adverse outcomes, but they can also encourage the kind of sustaining, and developmental environments that allow adults and young people to engage with the world with more confidence and with valuable personal, social and occupational skills. To extend the turtle beach metaphor further, natural disasters such as freak waves or hurricanes can negate the best efforts of beach management. A manager in one of our seminars reported that even silver linings can have clouds. So the policy environment does not simply comprise turtle beaches and rattlesnake farms. This paper explores these issues using our research in England as a source of examples. Since the election of a Labour government in the United Kingdom in 1997 there has been a great deal of change in education policies both generally and in the vocational education and training sector in particular. In this paper we focus on policies that are designed to provide support for learners who previously have not been successful in the education system. The particular learners on whom we focused in our research were unemployed adults with basic literacy and numeracy needs in adult and community learning (ACL) settings; 16 to 19 year old students in further education (FE) colleges who had not achieved the level of education in secondary schools designated by the government as being essential for employment in a modern economy; and employees undertaking basic work-based learning (WBL).","bibo:AuthorList":["Finlay, I","Gregson, M","Spours, K","Edward, S"],"dc:date":"2005-09","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":309343,"sim:weight":0.391974,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.32554,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387381,"sim:weight":0.324768,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.316735,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387150,"sim:weight":0.316717,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387169,"sim:weight":0.313818,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":101495,"sim:weight":0.313361,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.306126,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83093,"sim:weight":0.298814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":53067,"sim:weight":0.294567,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":740,"sim:weight":0.279249,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55307,"sim:weight":0.274995,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81413,"sim:weight":0.272702,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83092,"sim:weight":0.272212,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":99390,"sim:weight":0.271942,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.27038,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108416,"sim:weight":0.267486,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98688,"sim:weight":0.262387,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.259753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664228,"sim:weight":0.259753,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

The main aim of the project was to evaluate the impact of national policy on teaching, learning and inclusion in the sector, with a particular focus on three groups of learners who have been poorly served by their previous education: unemployed people in adult and community learning centres (ACL), low-skilled adult employees in work-based learning (WBL) and younger learners on Level 1 and Level 2 vocational courses in further education (FE) colleges. The first paper, by Ian Finlay, Ken Spours, Richard Steer, Frank Coffield, Maggie Gregson and Ann Hodgson, provides a critical review of policy documents on teaching, learning and assessment in the sector. The second paper, by Sheila Edward, Frank Coffield, Richard Steer and Maggie Gregson, explores the perspectives of tutors and managers working in the learning sites on the impact of policy on themselves and on their learners. In the following paper, Richard Steer and the rest of the team provide an overview of the changing use of policy ‘levers’ in the sector from the days of the Training and Enterprise Councils to the latest model employed by the LSC, with a particular focus on targets, funding, inspection, planning and initiatives. Ken Spours, Frank Coffield and Maggie Gregson then focus on the FE sector and provide an alternative explanation of why colleges have found it so difficult to respond to the plethora of government initiatives aimed at improving the quality of learning. Next, Ann Hodgson, Sheila Edward and Maggie Gregson look at the turbulence in basic skills provision in the community in the lifetime of our project, as growth of services and funding on an unprecedented scale has given way to anxiety about financial cuts. In the last of the papers from the research team, ‘Flowers in the desert’, Ian Finlay, Ann Hodgson and Richard Steer describe provision for learning in the workplace, which blossoms quickly with the injection of funding, but which can wither just as quickly if funds are withdrawn. The two final papers, by Mary Hamilton and Phil Hodkinson respectively, are from colleagues outside the research team who agreed to provide a commentary on our work and link it to their own.","bibo:AuthorList":["Finlay, I","Edward, S","Steer, R"],"dc:date":"2007-06","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":83384,"sim:weight":0.479339,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82691,"sim:weight":0.461483,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309343,"sim:weight":0.4479,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82686,"sim:weight":0.44,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82673,"sim:weight":0.423911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.378031,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5662,"sim:weight":0.371384,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.364911,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":54495,"sim:weight":0.361658,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.359983,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55852,"sim:weight":0.357353,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3533,"sim:weight":0.345869,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.341023,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":741,"sim:weight":0.334382,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82672,"sim:weight":0.333362,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":84897,"sim:weight":0.331397,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387381,"sim:weight":0.327056,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55307,"sim:weight":0.319108,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83093,"sim:weight":0.318172,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1652586,"sim:weight":0.309026,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

For the purposes of the Northern Ireland (NI) seminar, both the concept of ‘Home International’ and the framework will be used to compare and analyse the ways in which the changing teacher education policy context is convergent and/or divergent, with the three other jurisdictions of the UK.

Even though this sector caters for over 6 million learners and will play a key role in how prosperous and fair the UK will become, it is not well understood by practitioners or policy-makers. For over three years, the authors explored the interactions between these two groups by examining how policy is created and enacted in further, adult and work-based learning. Our data are presented as a series of stories: the learners’ experiences, the plans of the policy-makers to bring about radical change, and the struggles of tutors and managers, juggling both change and continuity. We also explain how the sector as a whole operates, as policy is mediated and translated by numerous actors at different levels. Our main finding is that the sector is undergoing a fundamental shift from area-based planning to a more marketised ‘demand-led system’ intended to give employers and learners more say over provision. Our evidence suggests that this high-risk strategy may destabilise FE colleges and other education providers and exclude disadvantaged learners. We outline the elements of an alternative system, underpinned by three principles: putting the relationship between tutor and learner at the heart of the new system; placing the claims of equity for once above the demands for economic efficiency; and ensuring a more moderate pace of change. Our alternative is based on ‘devolved social partnership’, where power is more equally shared between government and employers, trade unions, professionals and community representatives. This book is an invaluable resource for tutors, managers and institutional leaders in FE Colleges, Adult and Community Learning Centres and Work Based Learning sites.","bibo:AuthorList":["Coffield, F","Edward, S","Finlay, I","Hodgson, A","Spours, K","Steer, R"],"dc:date":"2008-03","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":83384,"sim:weight":0.479517,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":309343,"sim:weight":0.450121,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5662,"sim:weight":0.441663,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":3533,"sim:weight":0.406175,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83093,"sim:weight":0.394577,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55307,"sim:weight":0.393039,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.386989,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1628,"sim:weight":0.379884,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":82691,"sim:weight":0.368064,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.366336,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387150,"sim:weight":0.363076,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1653284,"sim:weight":0.354968,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.351289,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":108468,"sim:weight":0.347431,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":83092,"sim:weight":0.347388,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":741,"sim:weight":0.34188,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":51515,"sim:weight":0.334098,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387381,"sim:weight":0.332678,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55754,"sim:weight":0.32955,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":387169,"sim:weight":0.325512,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

This paper examines different interpretations of interactive teaching, considers why such teaching is believed to be more effective than approaches which place the teacher in a different role, and analyses the evidence concerning its effectiveness.  It discusses what advantages, if any, the use of ICT offers to teachers pursuing interactive teaching approaches in the classroom, then characterises the ways in which ICT needs to be integrated into teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge if it is to support a move from ‘surface’ to ‘deep’ interactive teaching.  Using a number of case studies drawn from research in primary and secondary schools, it explores how interactive teaching can be supported and improved using interactive technologies in the classroom.

Such situations can generate deep emotional reactions in students that override their capacity to engage in rational dialogue, or cause them to avoid such discourse at all. Facilitating understanding in these conditions requires specific responses on the part of the practitioner in order to establish a conducive and trusting environment for interaction.\n\nArising from the collective experience of three major curriculum initiatives in the field the paper identifies ten points on which to build effective practice. In the conclusion these are placed in the context of recent writing on the relationship between education and divided societies.","bibo:AuthorList":["McCully, Alan"],"dc:date":"2005","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.537776,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":46829,"sim:weight":0.523655,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.508454,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":47157,"sim:weight":0.487807,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.467243,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.464459,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386857,"sim:weight":0.44795,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.447275,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661926,"sim:weight":0.444533,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1383546,"sim:weight":0.436028,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":45448,"sim:weight":0.4346,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98915,"sim:weight":0.429611,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.428814,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80618,"sim:weight":0.414263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80623,"sim:weight":0.414263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80628,"sim:weight":0.414263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661720,"sim:weight":0.414263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":80633,"sim:weight":0.414263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661721,"sim:weight":0.414263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1661723,"sim:weight":0.414263,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}

{"identifier":309659,"ep:Repository":3,"dc:type":["Article"],"bibo:shortTitle":"Autonomy, conditions and constraints: some cross-cutting themes from ‘Learning How to Learn – in classrooms, schools and networks’","bibo:abstract":"The project aimed to link research conducted across organisational levels – in classrooms, in schools and across networks. This paper provides an overview of the project at the end of the funding period. Although analysis had focused particularly on the separate levels, and some across level analysis remains to be done, several cross-cutting themes, linking our levels, have emerged: \n\n1. Autonomy and agency. Our theoretical analysis led us to consider the development of learning autonomy as a central concept in learning how to learn (LHTL). Promoting learning autonomy also emerged as a key factor in our quantitative survey of teachers and is confirmed by our interviews and videos of classroom practice. All data sources point to the importance of teachers’ own sense of agency as crucial in creating the conditions for pupils’ voices to be heard and their autonomy to be enhanced. The application of formative principles in teachers’ own learning emerges as a strong theme. \n\n2. Conditions for classroom change: support for teachers’ in-class learning Teacher learning and school support for such learning are key preconditions for the sustained promotion of LHTL in classrooms.  Our data indicated that the conditions in project schools appeared to be conducive to teachers’ learning out of the classroom but less amenable to teachers’ learning with colleagues in the classroom. Yet, it was teachers’ in-class learning practices that were most strongly associated with their classroom promotion of LHTL. School conditions that underpinned teachers’ in-class learning practices centred on the development of a clear sense of direction, the promotion of staff development, the auditing of teachers’ expertise and support for teacher networking.\n\n3. Compliance and subversion as responses to the policy context. Interviews with headteachers and school co-ordinators revealed their concerns about leading learning in their schools within the context of prescriptive government policy. All schools were implementing government policies but with varying degrees of enthusiasm, locating themselves on a spectrum of compliance to subversion. Government policies were successful in leaving a depth of imprint on school practice and shaping the discourse which accompanied it.  However, the greater the external pressure, the greater was the desire for flexibility, diversification and agency.","bibo:AuthorList":["James, M","McCormick, R","Marshall, B","Pedder, D","Carmichael, P"],"dc:date":"2005-11","bibo:cites":[],"bibo:citedBy":[],"similarities":[{"identifier":55840,"sim:weight":0.659664,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":44980,"sim:weight":0.655107,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":50117,"sim:weight":0.624222,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":98824,"sim:weight":0.610147,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":386243,"sim:weight":0.600368,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":2755110,"sim:weight":0.584291,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1154678,"sim:weight":0.573674,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14194,"sim:weight":0.561619,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":109218,"sim:weight":0.558206,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":5509,"sim:weight":0.554786,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":14195,"sim:weight":0.526744,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":397015,"sim:weight":0.526375,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":81716,"sim:weight":0.521973,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1527770,"sim:weight":0.512572,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":8120,"sim:weight":0.512264,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1352186,"sim:weight":0.499208,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1667618,"sim:weight":0.49075,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1664919,"sim:weight":0.490615,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1640334,"sim:weight":0.482638,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"},{"identifier":1385743,"sim:weight":0.477789,"sim:AssociationMethod":"similarity_cosine"}]}
